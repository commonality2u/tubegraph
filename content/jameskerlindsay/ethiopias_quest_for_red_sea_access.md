In October 2023, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali initiated concerns about a potential new [[tensions_and_potential_conflict_in_the_horn_of_africa|conflict in the Horn of Africa]] by advocating for Ethiopia to have access to the strategically vital Red Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This statement led neighboring Eritrea to put its forces on alert, raising the specter of renewed hostilities between the two countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. While the immediate threat has reportedly lessened, the underlying concern about a conflict persists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## The Strategic Importance of Sea Access

Geography plays a crucial role in international relations, particularly for landlocked states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Without direct access to the sea, and thus international waters and airspace, these states often feel vulnerable and dependent on their neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Historically, many have viewed unfettered strategic sea access as a vital national interest, sometimes leading to conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This issue gained international attention again in October 2023 when Ethiopia's Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed Ali, publicly stated Ethiopia's need for direct access to the Red Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Despite subsequent assurances from Ethiopia that it has no hostile intentions, the complex [[ethiopian_eritrean_relations_and_history|history of poor relations between the two countries]] has fueled worries about a potential new conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Historical Context of Ethiopia's Landlocked Status

Ethiopia, the world's 26th largest country and Africa's 10th largest state by area, is landlocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. It borders Djibouti, Somalia, Kenya, South Sudan, Sudan, Eritrea, and the internationally unrecognised [[somalilands_quest_for_international_recognition|Somaliland]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. In contrast, Eritrea, located to Ethiopia's northeast, boasts a long coastline on the Red Sea, one of the world's crucial strategic waterways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Ethiopia is Africa's second most populous country with 120 million inhabitants, while Eritrea has a population of around 3.6 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### Early History and Colonialism
The two countries share a long [[ethiopian_eritrean_relations_and_history|history]], including the Kingdom of Axum, which encompassed present-day Eritrea and northern Ethiopia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. The modern story of their relationship, particularly regarding sea access, began in the 19th century with European colonial expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Italy established a trading outpost in Eritrea in 1869, eventually creating the Colony of Eritrea and taking control of Somaliland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Ethiopia, despite resisting colonization for some time, fell under Italian control in 1936, though this was short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

### Post-WWII and the Federation
After Italy's defeat in 1941 by British and Ethiopian forces, Ethiopia regained its independence, becoming a founding member of the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Eritrea, however, came under British trusteeship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
Initially, Eritrea was expected to exercise self-determination, but deep divisions emerged between its Muslim community, favoring independence, and most Christians (primarily Ethiopian Orthodox Church members), who preferred union with Ethiopia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. Crucially, Ethiopia was "desperate to gain access to the Red Sea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

Faced with this deadlock, the UN General Assembly considered options, ultimately choosing to create a federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. On September 15, 1952, the Federation of Ethiopia and Eritrea was formed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

### Eritrean War of Independence
The federation was troubled from the start, with Ethiopia viewing itself as the senior partner due to its size, population, and history of independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Resentment grew in Eritrea, leading to an uprising by the Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF) in September 1961 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. In response, Ethiopia dissolved the Federation and annexed Eritrea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. The ELF continued its campaign, known as the Eritrean War of Independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

In 1974, Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie was overthrown by a Marxist military coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. The Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF), which emerged from the ELF, allied with other rebel groups, including the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front (TPLF), against the new Ethiopian regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. As the Soviet Union collapsed, weakening the Ethiopian government, rebel forces gained the upper hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. By May 1991, the TPLF, EPLF, and their allies took control of Addis Ababa, ousting the military government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

### Eritrea's Independence and Ethiopia Becomes Landlocked
The overthrow of the military regime fundamentally transformed Eritrea's prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. The EPLF announced an independence referendum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. With UN support, the people of Eritrea voted overwhelmingly for statehood in April 1993, with 99.8% in favor on a 98% turnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. On May 28, 1993, Eritrea was admitted as the 183rd member of the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Eritrea's independence left Ethiopia landlocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

## Border Disputes and Renewed Tensions

Initially, relations between the two countries appeared positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. However, problems soon arose, primarily centered on their shared border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. Eritrea claimed territory along the entire boundary, with particular contention over parts of Ethiopia's Tigray province <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. As Tigrayans from the TPLF dominated the new Ethiopian government, they fiercely rejected Eritrea's demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

### The Border War (1998-2000)
After several years of escalating tensions, war broke out on May 6, 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. This conflict was marked by extreme brutality, resulting in as many as 100,000 deaths and massive displacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. Ethiopia gained the upper hand after two years of fighting, leading to a UN-monitored ceasefire in June 2000 and a formal peace deal six months later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

As part of the peace deal, a boundary commission was created in cooperation with the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. In 2002, the commission awarded a small Tigrayan village to Eritrea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Despite agreeing to be bound by the decision, the Ethiopian government rejected the outcome, sparking anger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. This refusal prevented a new war but ensured high tensions and occasional violent clashes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

### Abiy Ahmed's Overture and the [[tensions_and_potential_conflict_in_the_horn_of_africa|Tigray War]]
In April 2018, the election of reformist Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali in Ethiopia marked a turning point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. As an ethnic Oromo, he began to challenge the entrenched Tigrayan dominance in Ethiopian politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Two months into his term, he announced that his government would accept the Border Commission's decision, drawing international praise and earning him the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. This led to an immediate thawing of relations with Eritrea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>, including a face-to-face meeting between Abiy Ahmed and Eritrea's long-standing President, Isaias Afwerki <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

However, this decision caused outrage in Tigray, where the TPLF still dominated local politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. Tensions escalated in 2020 when Tigray proceeded with its regional elections despite Ethiopia postponing national elections due to the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. With neither side recognizing the other's legitimacy, Abiy Ahmed sent the Ethiopian National Defense Force to retake control of Tigray and remove the TPLF from power in November 2020, leading to a civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

Abiy Ahmed's improved relations with Eritrea proved beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. President Afwerki, holding a deep hatred for the TPLF, quickly offered support to Addis Ababa, providing sanctuary to Ethiopian troops fleeing into Eritrea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. The TPLF launched rocket attacks on Eritrea following reports that Eritrea allowed Ethiopian forces to launch attacks on Tigray from its territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. Within months, reports emerged that Eritrean forces assisted the Ethiopian Army in Tigray and were involved in atrocities, leading to accusations of war crimes and potentially crimes against humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. Despite the joint cooperation, Tigrayan forces initially staged a comeback, but with Eritrean support, Ethiopian troops eventually pushed them back in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. The African Union brokered a peace deal, leading to the surrender and demobilization of TPLF forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

## Renewed Push for Red Sea Access (October 2023)

The renewed concern about a return to war between Ethiopia and Eritrea stems from several factors, including Eritrea's exclusion from the peace talks that ended the [[tensions_and_potential_conflict_in_the_horn_of_africa|Tigray War]] despite its alliance with the Ethiopian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. There are also claims that Eritrean troops remain in Tigray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

The immediate cause for concern was Abiy Ahmed's speech on October 15, 2023, where he stated that Ethiopia, one of Africa's fastest-developing economies, should assert its rights to access the Red Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. Given that many Ethiopians still view Eritrea as a historic part of their country, this sparked fears that the Ethiopian government was considering an invasion of Eritrea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>. Eritrean forces moved close to the border, prompting a similar response from Ethiopia, raising concerns of imminent conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

However, this appeared to be a false alarm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. Just ten days later, Abiy Ahmed addressed the National Defense Forces, insisting that Ethiopia would not pursue its interests by force or attack "its fellow brothers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.

Despite these denials, the long [[ethiopian_eritrean_relations_and_history|history of tensions between the two countries]] and Ethiopia's persistent desire for maritime access lead many to wonder whether Ethiopia and Eritrea are still headed towards another war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

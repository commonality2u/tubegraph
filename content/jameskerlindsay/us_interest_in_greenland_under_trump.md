In December 2024, President-elect Donald Trump caused an international stir by posting a message on his social media platform, stating that the United States considered ownership and control of Greenland essential for its national security and freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. In January 2025, when pressed on the issue, the incoming president refused to rule out using military force to take control of the Danish territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. While many believe these comments are mere hype, others perceive a dangerous intent behind the threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## [[greenlands_history_and_political_status | Greenland: Geography, History, and Political Status]]

[[greenlands_history_and_political_status | Greenland]] is the world's largest island, covering 2.2 million square kilometers (840,000 square miles), and is situated between the Atlantic and Arctic oceans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. To its west, Canada's Ellesmere Island is merely 26 km (16 miles) away, while Iceland lies 740 km (460 miles) to its east <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. The island has a population of around 56,000, with 80% of its land covered in ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Most inhabitants reside along the coastal regions in towns like Nuuk, the capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Approximately 90% of the population is of native Inuit origin, with the remaining 10% being Danish or mixed heritage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

[[greenlands_history_and_political_status | Greenland's history]] dates back about 4,500 years with the arrival of the first settlers from North America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Norse settlers from Iceland also arrived around the 11th century but disappeared by the 15th century due to climate changes and conflict with the Inuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Danish influence began in the early 18th century, making [[greenlands_history_and_political_status | Greenland]] part of the joint state of Denmark-Norway until 1814, when Denmark retained control following the Treaty of Kiel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

During World War II, following Denmark's fall to Nazi Germany, the United States oversaw the territory for several years starting in 1941, establishing an important airbase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Although Denmark regained control after the war, the US base remained, becoming an essential facility for intelligence, early warning, and refueling throughout the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

[[greenlands_history_and_political_status | Greenland's colonial status]] was abolished in 1953, making it a formal Danish province <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. It gained self-rule in 1979, and by 2009, local power expanded significantly, giving Greenlanders control over most aspects of their governance, including health, education, natural resources, and the local economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Denmark, however, continues to manage foreign affairs, security, and defense, and provides around a fifth of [[greenlands_history_and_political_status | Greenland's income]] through a yearly grant of approximately half a billion USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. [[greenlands_history_and_political_status | Greenland]] also maintains its own political institutions, including a prime minister, executive, and parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

Despite close ties with Denmark, there have been growing calls for independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Concerns exist about [[greenlands_history_and_political_status | Greenland's viability as an independent country]] due to its small population and economic reliance on Denmark, making independence a longer-term goal rather than an immediate priority for many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## Trump's Proposals and Threats

Donald Trump previously proposed purchasing [[greenlands_history_and_political_status | Greenland]] in 2019 during his first term, a suggestion dismissed as "absurd" by Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, leading Trump to cancel a planned state visit to Denmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Despite officials from Denmark and [[greenlands_history_and_political_status | Greenland]] again rejecting his recent calls, insisting the territory is not for sale, there are fears that a more dangerous intent may be at play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

In the space of a few weeks, Trump has made explicit claims against Canada and [[Trump_Administration_and_Panama_Canal_control | Panama]], and is now threatening NATO ally Denmark over [[greenlands_history_and_political_status | Greenland]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This pattern of threats is seen as a challenge to the long-standing international principle that state borders are sacrosanct and countries will respect each other's territorial integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## [[geopolitical_significance_of_greenland | Geopolitical Significance of Greenland]]

Observers note that Trump's recent comments appear to have a more serious and calculated intent this time, reflecting genuine security concerns over [[greenlands_history_and_political_status | Greenland's status]] in a changing geopolitical context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. [[geopolitical_significance_of_greenland | Greenland]] is considered vital for reigning in Russian and Chinese activities in the Arctic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. The melting Arctic ice due to global warming is making [[greenlands_history_and_political_status | Greenland]] an increasingly significant point for new shipping routes and is making previously hard-to-reach resources more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

## International Reactions

The realization that Trump seems serious about taking control of [[greenlands_history_and_political_status | Greenland]] has led to strong international responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. Denmark has firmly rejected the claims and increased its defense commitment to [[greenlands_history_and_political_status | Greenland]], though it stressed this was pre-planned and insufficient to ward off a US attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Key European partners, including France and Germany, have asserted that [[greenlands_history_and_political_status | Greenland]] is subject to the European Union's mutual defense provisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. However, EU officials have adopted a more cautious stance, refusing to be drawn on specific actions if Trump were to act on his threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

## Potential Scenarios for US Control

### Peaceful Acquisition

The most obvious route for the United States to acquire [[greenlands_history_and_political_status | Greenland]] would be peacefully, perhaps through purchase as Trump suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. However, Denmark could not sell it without [[greenlands_history_and_political_status | Greenland's approval]], which would likely necessitate promises of significant public spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. The territory's exact status within the US would also need to be determined, likely as an overseas territory akin to Puerto Rico, given [[greenlands_history_and_political_status | Greenland's tiny population]] despite its size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Many Greenlanders might view their present relationship with Denmark as more beneficial in the long run than US control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

### Military Action

If peaceful efforts failed and Trump pursued an invasion, the diplomatic and political implications would be immense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. An attack on [[greenlands_history_and_political_status | Greenland]] would be a direct strike against a NATO ally, creating an unprecedented crisis within the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. While EU partners would likely not respond militarily, they would probably pursue strong diplomatic, political, and economic measures, such as imposing sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. This could lead to US retaliation and a fundamental breakdown of Western relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. Such a scenario could even prompt Trump to withdraw the United States from NATO, as he has repeatedly suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

## Consequences of Normalizing Force

Trump's statements, even if dismissed as attention-seeking, are considered extremely dangerous as they normalize the idea that states can threaten to use force to seize territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. This risks a return to "might-is-right" power politics, marked by regular wars, if major powers like Russia and the United States freely discuss seizing land from other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

## Alternative: Free Association

An option that could be acceptable to all parties is the concept of "free association" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. This allows small independent states to develop a formal relationship with a larger country to oversee their foreign and defense policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. The United States already has such agreements with the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau, all of which are separate UN members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

This could be an option for [[greenlands_history_and_political_status | Greenland]], and at least one of its political leaders has already raised the possibility, perhaps even in conjunction with Denmark, creating a unique hybrid model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. This arrangement could grant [[greenlands_history_and_political_status | Greenland]] the independence many desire, alongside the security and support it would still need, while giving the United States direct control over important aspects of security and defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

The ultimate question remains whether this solution would satisfy Trump, or if his ambition is to bring [[greenlands_history_and_political_status | Greenland]] wholly and entirely under US control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

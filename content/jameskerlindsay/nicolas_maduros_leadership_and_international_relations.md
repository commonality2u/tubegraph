Over the past 25 years, [[Venezuelas changing international status | Venezuela]] has endured severe economic and political turbulence, leading to its status as a pariah on the international stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This decline began under the socialist president [[hugo_chavezs_presidency_and_policies | Hugo Chavez]] and accelerated significantly under its current leader, [[Nicolas Maduros leadership and international relations | Nicolas Maduro]], whose presidency is widely unrecognized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Once one of South America's richest and most democratic states, [[Venezuelas political history | Venezuela]] has become an impoverished, authoritarian, and isolated nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. However, there are recent signs that [[Venezuelas changing international status | Venezuela]] is regaining international acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### The "Resource Curse" and Venezuela's Economic Collapse

Despite possessing the world's largest oil deposits, even more than Saudi Arabia, [[Venezuelas political history | Venezuela]] has experienced economic collapse and descended into what many describe as a dictatorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This phenomenon, known as the "resource curse," describes how countries with considerable natural wealth often face worse developmental outcomes, including low economic progress and greater political instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

[[Venezuelas political history | Venezuela]] profited massively from oil starting in the 20th century, becoming the world's largest petroleum exporter by the 1950s and a key supplier to the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. The country also transitioned to democratic control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. However, serious economic problems emerged in the late 1980s when international oil prices fell, leading to a debt crisis, surging inflation, growing unemployment, and political instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. Major riots broke out in Caracas in 1989, resulting in hundreds or thousands of deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

### The Rise of [[hugo_chavezs_presidency_and_policies | Hugo Chavez]] and [[Nicolas Maduros leadership and international relations | Nicolas Maduro]]

In 1992, [[hugo_chavezs_presidency_and_policies | Hugo Chavez]], a left-wing military officer, launched a failed coup but was later pardoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. He won the presidential election in 1998 with 56% of the vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Once in power, [[hugo_chavezs_presidency_and_policies | Chavez]] pursued a radical agenda of economic, social, and political change, increasing public spending on healthcare, education, and infrastructure, and nationalizing parts of the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Despite growing popularity among the poor, his policies faced increasing opposition from the middle and wealthy classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. An attempted military coup in April 2002 briefly forced [[hugo_chavezs_presidency_and_policies | Chavez]] from power, but his supporters quickly mobilized, restoring him within 48 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

[[hugo_chavezs_presidency_and_policies | Chavez]] became a high-profile figure on the international stage, openly criticizing the United States and strengthening relations with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. However, problems began to set in as the poorly run oil industry suffered from low investment and maintenance, leading to declining production and slowed revenues, even as international oil prices remained high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

### [[Nicolas Maduros leadership and international relations | Nicolas Maduro]]'s Presidency and the Intensifying Crisis

In March 2013, [[hugo_chavezs_presidency_and_policies | Chavez]] died and was immediately succeeded by then-Vice President [[Nicolas Maduros leadership and international relations | Nicolas Maduro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Committed to his predecessor's policies, [[Nicolas Maduros leadership and international relations | Maduro]] narrowly won a special presidential election a month later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

The following year, [[Venezuelas political history | Venezuela]]'s economic difficulties escalated into a full-blown crisis as global oil prices plummeted from nearly $110 a barrel in June 2014 to just $29 a barrel by January 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. This catastrophic collapse led to a sharp drop in living standards, forcing hundreds of thousands to flee the country, and sparking widespread popular protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

In an attempt to retain power, [[Nicolas Maduros leadership and international relations | Maduro]] clamped down on civil liberties and democratic freedoms, introducing rule by decree, imposing media restrictions, and appearing to authorize lethal force against demonstrators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

### International Condemnation and Recognition Crisis

International concern grew as the United States began imposing sanctions on the Venezuelan regime for human rights violations, followed by targeted sanctions from the European Union starting in November 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

The key moment came in May 2018 when [[Venezuelas political history | Venezuela]] held new presidential elections, widely condemned as neither free nor fair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. [[Nicolas Maduros leadership and international relations | Maduro]] claimed an overwhelming victory and was sworn into office for a second term on January 10, 2019, but the result was widely rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. The National Assembly, then under opposition control, dismissed the outcome and named its President, Juan Guaidó, as the country's interim president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

[[International relations and conflict resolution | International opinion]] became deeply divided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>:
*   **Recognizing [[Nicolas Maduros leadership and international relations | Maduro]]**: Russia, China, Turkey, Iran, Ethiopia, South Africa, and many other countries accepted [[Nicolas Maduros leadership and international relations | Maduro]] as president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   **Recognizing Guaidó**: The West (United States, European Union, Canada, Australia, Japan) and many South American states (Brazil, Colombia, Peru) recognized Guaidó as the interim president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

With widespread protests and over a million Venezuelans having fled the economic collapse, the matter even reached the UN Security Council, but no action was taken due to divisions among permanent members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. Many countries, particularly the United States, began openly calling [[Nicolas Maduros leadership and international relations | Maduro]] a dictator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

### Shifting Sands: [[Venezuelas changing international status | Venezuela]]'s Reacceptance

Despite this backdrop, there are significant signs of change. In November 2022, [[Nicolas Maduros leadership and international relations | Nicolas Maduro]] attended the COP27 environment summits in Egypt, where he had a public conversation with French President Macron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Macron, whose country had previously refused to recognize [[Nicolas Maduros leadership and international relations | Maduro]] and accused him of establishing a dictatorship, now referred to him as president in an exceptionally friendly exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Other countries, including the United States, are also showing signs of changing their position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The European Union stopped recognizing Guaidó as interim president in January 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

This apparent shift is driven by two distinct factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>:

1.  **Political Changes in South America**: The election of Gustavo Petro in neighboring Colombia has led to a thawing of relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Petro visited [[Nicolas Maduros leadership and international relations | Maduro]] on November 1, becoming the first Latin American leader to do so since the 2019 elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. The rise of the political left elsewhere in the region, such as Luis Inácio Lula da Silva's recent election in Brazil, also suggests a potential for renewed engagement with [[Nicolas Maduros leadership and international relations | Maduro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.
2.  **Pragmatism and Realism in the West**: Hopes that [[Nicolas Maduros leadership and international relations | Maduro]] would be quickly forced from power have not materialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. Crucially, wider geopolitical factors have altered calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. Russia's war against Ukraine has disrupted energy supplies, forcing a worldwide search for other oil producers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. [[Venezuelas political history | Venezuela]], with its vast oil reserves, could no longer be ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

Ultimately, [[Venezuelas changing international status | Venezuela]]'s rehabilitation is not due to overcoming its resource curse by re-establishing democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. Instead, it stems from the fact that the rest of the world remains heavily reliant on fossil fuels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

On 1 January 2024, Ethiopia and Somaliland signed a landmark agreement that could potentially lead to Ethiopia recognizing Somaliland's independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This development has significant [[ethiopia_and_somalias_diplomatic_relations | implications for Somalia]], which considers Somaliland part of its sovereign territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.

## Somalia's Reaction and Diplomatic Fallout

Mogadishu has expressed strong opposition to the [[ethiopia_somaliland_agreement | agreement]], signalling its fury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. Somalia has denounced the memorandum of understanding (MoU), passing a law declaring it null and void <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. Somalia insists it will do whatever it takes to preserve its territorial integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

### Threat of Military Action

Somalia has called the move an act of aggression and has even suggested it is willing to consider military options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. While this might have seemed unrealistic given the precarious nature of the Somali state and its ongoing battles against Islamist insurgents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>, the situation is evolving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. Somaliland's position has weakened, particularly following recent fighting in the disputed eastern area of Las Anod <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

## Undermining Somaliland's International Recognition

Somalia's strong opposition to the agreement may undermine Somaliland's hopes for broader acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. Mogadishu will undoubtedly try to persuade other countries that any Ethiopian recognition is primarily about Ethiopian self-interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

This argument could resonate internationally because:
*   **Transactional Nature**: Rather than seeing recognition as a principled step, many countries may view it as a transactional move linked to Ethiopia's desire for Red Sea access, deterring them from following suit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.
*   **Regional Stability Concerns**: Somalia will argue that such recognition would destabilize African borders more broadly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. States often prefer not to open dangerous new precedents, especially in Africa, given its patchwork of colonial borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. Many countries are nervous about challenging the sanctity of state boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

## International Support for Somalia's Territorial Integrity

Crucially, there are signs that significant international actors are stepping back from the possibility of [[somalilands_struggle_for_international_recognition | Somaliland's recognition]], showing nervousness about what it would mean for Somalia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

*   **United States**: Despite earlier signals that it might recognize Somaliland, the United States has now stated its full support for Somalia's territorial integrity within its 1960 borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.
*   **Regional Actors**: Several other significant regional actors, including Egypt and Turkey, have lined up behind Somalia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. These countries possess diplomatic clout and could support Mogadishu if a conflict emerges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

While the MoU has been hailed as a significant step for Somaliland, the strong opposition from Somalia and the backing from key international players suggest that Ethiopian recognition is far from guaranteed, and even if it occurs, it may not advance Somaliland's broader international acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.

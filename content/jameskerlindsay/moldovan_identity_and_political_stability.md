Moldova, which emerged as an independent state with the collapse of the Soviet Union, is described as an "accidental country" due to its historical ties with Romania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. While calls for the two countries to unite have long existed, Moldova's path has been marked by the development of a distinct Moldovan identity and subsequent political instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Historical Promotion of a Separate Moldovan Identity

Historically, Moldova (specifically Bessarabia) was part of Moldavia, which eventually merged with Wallachia to form the Kingdom of Romania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. However, Bessarabia was ceded to Imperial Russia in 1812 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Although it reunited with Romania briefly after declaring independence against the backdrop of the Russian Revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, this union was short-lived and unhappy, with Romania largely ignoring Bessarabia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

The Soviet Union never accepted this annexation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, retaking the region in June 1940 to create the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Even after Romania fell to communism and became a Soviet satellite state, Moscow ensured the two territories remained separate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Fearing pan-Romanian sentiment, Soviet authorities actively promoted a separate Moldovan identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This was achieved by emphasizing differences between the languages, reintroducing the Cyrillic script, and bringing in Russian and Ukrainian settlers to alter the demographic mix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. As a result, Ukrainians and Russians still represent approximately seven and four percent of the Moldovan population today, respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

## Post-Soviet Political Instability and Divisions

With the collapse of the Soviet Union, Moldova became an independent state on December 25, 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. Initially, there was a sense that Moldova and Romania might pursue unification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. However, this prospect was short-lived, as divisions emerged within Moldova <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>:
*   Those advocating for union with Romania, even on a gradual basis.
*   Those supporting the continued existence of a separate Moldovan state, with varying degrees of relations with Romania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

This divergence led to different paths for the two countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. While Romania pursued integration with the West, joining [[european_union_and_nato_membership_prospects_for_moldova_and_romania|NATO]] in 2004 and the [[european_union_and_nato_membership_prospects_for_moldova_and_romania|European Union]] in 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, Moldova faced years of political instability. The country continually teetered between governments favoring closer relations with the [[european_union_and_nato_membership_prospects_for_moldova_and_romania|European Union]] and those preferring stronger ties to Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

## Current Stance on Identity and Unification

Despite evidence of growing support for unification in recent years, polling suggests only 40 to 45 percent of Moldovans truly desire it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. This reluctance is driven by several factors:
*   **Distinct Moldovan Identity**: A separate Moldovan identity has emerged, despite close ties with Romania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Fear of Subordination**: Moldovans perceive that, due to its small size and population, Moldova would inevitably be a minor player in a united Romania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>, a view shaped by past historical experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   **Value of Independence**: Moldova, despite its challenges, values its status as an independent state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Limited Economic Benefit**: While unification might offer economic benefits, it is not seen as a panacea, as Romania is not wealthy enough to inject vast sums into reunification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
*   **Citizenship Benefits**: Many Moldovans already hold Romanian, and by extension [[european_union_and_nato_membership_prospects_for_moldova_and_romania|EU]], citizenship (approximately a quarter of the population, including President Maia Sandu), allowing them to live and work in the [[european_union_and_nato_membership_prospects_for_moldova_and_romania|European Union]] without unification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

## Future Prospects

The war in Ukraine has raised concerns about Moldova being a potential next target for Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. This has shifted Moldova's focus towards [[moldovas_eu_membership_pursuit_and_its_impact|EU integration]] rather than unification with Romania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Moldova has formally submitted its application for [[moldovas_eu_membership_pursuit_and_its_impact|European Union membership]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. However, [[european_union_and_nato_membership_prospects_for_moldova_and_romania|NATO membership]] remains off the agenda, as neutrality is enshrined in the Moldovan constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

From Romania's perspective, unification is not as popular as widely believed, with some estimates putting support as low as 15 to 20 percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Practical concerns include the significant economic cost of integrating Moldova and fears of importing Moldova's political divisions and a quarter of a million ethnic Russians into Romania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

While unification may remain a national aspiration, it is perhaps "a goal never to be reached" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. Instead, it is more likely that Romania and Moldova may one day be united within the [[european_union_and_nato_membership_prospects_for_moldova_and_romania|European Union]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>, despite the complexities posed by the unresolved conflict in [[implications_of_transnistrias_status_for_moldova_and_international_relations|Transnistria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

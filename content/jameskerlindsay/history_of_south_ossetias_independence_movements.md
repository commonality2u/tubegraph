[[south_ossetia_and_its_political_status | South Ossetia]] is a breakaway region of Georgia, which sought to break away as the Soviet Union began to dissolve in the late 1980s [00:01:45].

## Geographical Context and Demographics

[[south_ossetia_and_its_political_status | South Ossetia]] is located in the north-central part of Georgia [00:02:59]. It covers 3,900 square kilometers (1,500 square miles), making up about 5.5% of Georgia's total territory [00:03:02]. While official figures state a population of 50,000, most observers estimate it to be between 35,000 and 40,000 people [00:03:11].

The Ossetians are a predominantly Christian Orthodox people residing in an area that spans the Caucasus Mountains [00:03:19]. Their ancestry is traced to the Alans, an ancient Iranian people [00:03:26].

## Early Historical Background

The modern history of the Ossetians began in the late 18th century when Imperial Russia started expanding into the Caucasus [00:03:32]. After conquering the northern part of the region, Russian forces took the south, along with the rest of Georgia, at the beginning of the 19th century [00:03:37].

In 1917, the two parts of Ossetia were separated by the Russian Revolution [00:03:45]. While North Ossetia remained within Russia, [[south_ossetia_and_its_political_status | South Ossetia]] became part of a short-lived independent Georgian state [00:03:51]. This division led to a series of South Ossetian uprisings, which were brutally suppressed [00:03:57].

In 1921, Georgia was captured by the Soviet Red Army [00:04:03]. Despite hopes for reunification with North Ossetia, the region was granted self-rule as the [[south_ossetia_and_its_political_status | South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast]] within the new Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic [00:04:12]. This arrangement continued for seventy years [00:04:22].

## Breakaway from Georgia

By the late 1980s, as the Soviet Union began to disintegrate, [[south_ossetia_and_its_political_status | South Ossetia]] sought an opportunity to break away [00:04:24]. In 1989, amidst escalating tensions with the Georgian leadership, the [[south_ossetia_and_its_political_status | South Ossetian Supreme Soviet]] voted to unite with North Ossetia [00:04:32]. Although Soviet troops prevented violent clashes, [[south_ossetia_and_its_political_status | South Ossetia]] declared itself a separate Soviet republic the following year and sought Moscow's recognition [00:04:40]. In response, Georgian authorities revoked its autonomy and declared a state of emergency [00:04:51].

In 1991, as Georgia regained independence, it attempted to retake [[south_ossetia_and_its_political_status | South Ossetia]] by force [00:04:58]. Despite initial gains, Georgia could not seize the entire region [00:05:07]. With fighting also escalating in Abkhazia, Georgia accepted a ceasefire, establishing a joint peacekeeping force with [[russias_relationship_with_south_ossetia | Russia]] and opening peace talks under the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) [00:05:11].

## Renewed Tensions and the 2008 War

The decade following 1991 saw relative peace and ongoing contact between [[south_ossetia_and_its_political_status | South Ossetia]] and Georgia [00:05:30]. However, this ended in 2003 when a new pro-Western president, Mikhail Saakashvili, came to power in Georgia [00:05:39]. His pledge to reassert control over the breakaway regions led to renewed fighting [00:05:49]. Despite Georgia's offer of maximum autonomy, [[south_ossetia_and_its_political_status | South Ossetian]] leaders called an independence referendum, which showed overwhelming support for statehood [00:05:55].

Tensions remained high over the next few years, fueled by increasing hostility between [[russias_relationship_with_south_ossetia | Russia]] and the West [00:06:08]. In April 2008, NATO's formal welcome of Georgia's aspiration for membership was condemned by Moscow as a "huge strategic mistake" [00:06:17].

On August 7, 2008, [[russias_relationship_with_south_ossetia | Russia]] and Georgia went to war [00:06:27]. Georgia ordered its forces into [[south_ossetia_and_its_political_status | South Ossetia]] in response to what it claimed was an attack on its troops [00:06:37]. Within hours, [[russias_relationship_with_south_ossetia | Russian]] soldiers and heavy armor entered through the Roki Tunnel [00:06:44]. Five days later, following a massive [[russias_relationship_with_south_ossetia | Russian]] onslaught, Georgia was forced to capitulate [00:06:52].

Under the ceasefire, [[russias_relationship_with_south_ossetia | Russian]] troops largely withdrew, but [[south_ossetia_and_its_political_status | South Ossetia]] and Abkhazia (approximately 20% of Georgia's territory) remained under effective [[russias_relationship_with_south_ossetia | Russian]] control [00:07:00]. Two weeks later, Moscow recognized both territories as independent sovereign states [00:07:14].

## Quest for Unification with Russia

While [[south_ossetia_and_its_political_status | South Ossetia's]] independence was largely rejected internationally, four other countries (Nicaragua, Venezuela, Nauru, and Syria) eventually recognized it [00:07:22]. However, most observers believe that [[south_ossetia_and_its_political_status | South Ossetia]] had little genuine interest in full independence [00:07:34]. Opinion polls indicated overwhelming support for unification with the larger and more populous North Ossetia within the [[russias_relationship_with_south_ossetia | Russian Federation]] [00:07:40]. As a result, calls for a referendum on integration grew [00:07:53].

Despite growing economic and political ties between North and [[south_ossetia_and_its_political_status | South Ossetia]], and increasing [[russias_relationship_with_south_ossetia | Russian]] control over [[south_ossetia_and_its_political_status | South Ossetia]], Moscow consistently resisted calls for annexation [00:07:57]. Instead, [[russias_relationship_with_south_ossetia | Russia]] appeared to prefer "creeping de facto integration" over formal unification [00:08:12]. This preference continued even after [[russias_relationship_with_south_ossetia | Russia]] annexed Crimea in 2014 [00:08:18]. For example, a 2015 treaty of alliance and integration, while guaranteeing [[south_ossetia_and_its_political_status | South Ossetia's]] defense and security and creating a customs union, was framed in terms of interstate relations [00:08:23].

## 2022 Referendum Attempt and Cancellation

Despite [[russias_relationship_with_south_ossetia | Russia's]] apparent opposition, unification with [[russias_relationship_with_south_ossetia | Russia]] remains a key agenda item for [[south_ossetia_and_its_political_status | South Ossetia]] [00:08:40, 00:10:49]. This was highlighted in Spring 2022 when, with international attention on the war in Ukraine, [[south_ossetia_and_its_political_status | South Ossetian]] leader Anatoly Bibilov announced plans for a referendum on union with [[russias_relationship_with_south_ossetia | Russia]] [00:08:53]. Initially, this was seen by many as an attempt to shore up his re-election campaign [00:09:02]. Even after being defeated, Bibilov announced the poll would proceed on July 17 [00:09:12].

While Georgia, the European Union, and the United States condemned the planned vote, [[russias_relationship_with_south_ossetia | Russia]] also announced its opposition [00:09:22]. [[russias_relationship_with_south_ossetia | Russian]] Government Spokesman Dmitry Peskov suggested the Kremlin had not been consulted and expressed concerns about the legal implications [00:09:34]. Moscow made it clear it had no intention of annexation at that stage [00:09:51].

On May 31, the new [[south_ossetia_and_its_political_status | South Ossetian]] leader, Alan Gagloyev, issued a decree canceling the vote [00:10:00]. This decision left little doubt that Moscow had intervened [00:10:08]. The cancellation cited legal uncertainties and emphasized that [[south_ossetia_and_its_political_status | South Ossetia]] could not make unilateral decisions affecting [[russias_relationship_with_south_ossetia | Russia's]] interests [00:10:13].

## Reasons for Cancellation

The decision to cancel the referendum appeared strange, given the strong support for unification with [[russias_relationship_with_south_ossetia | Russia]] within [[south_ossetia_and_its_political_status | South Ossetia]] and its long history of integration [00:10:30, 00:10:59]. Furthermore, the timing seemed ideal due to the war in Ukraine, with [[russias_relationship_with_south_ossetia | Russia]] facing extensive sanctions and potentially having little to lose economically or diplomatically [00:11:12]. Annexation could even have sent a message to the West and paved the way for expected annexations in Ukraine [00:11:35].

However, the problem evidently lay with [[russias_relationship_with_south_ossetia | Russia]] [00:12:07]. Annexation of [[south_ossetia_and_its_political_status | South Ossetia]] offered little domestic benefit to [[russias_relationship_with_south_ossetia | Russia]], as Russians did not have the same emotional connection to Ossetia as to Crimea or Donbas [00:12:15]. Moreover, it would incur wider international costs, including further reputational damage [00:12:36]. [[south_ossetia_and_its_political_status | South Ossetia]] also remained a useful bargaining chip with Georgia [00:12:45]. Formal annexation would make it difficult for [[russias_relationship_with_south_ossetia | Russia]] to leave the door open for [[south_ossetia_and_its_political_status | South Ossetia's]] reintegration into Georgia, as the [[russias_relationship_with_south_ossetia | Russian]] constitution prohibits giving up territory [00:12:54]. Therefore, gradual integration short of actual annexation was seen as a better long-term option for Moscow [00:13:10].

Despite this, the explanation is not entirely convincing, as it would defy a deep-rooted Ossetian wish for unification and complicate existing ties [00:13:25]. The situation between de facto states and their patrons is often far more complex than it appears on the surface [00:14:10].

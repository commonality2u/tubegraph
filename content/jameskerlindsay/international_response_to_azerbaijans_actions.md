On 19 September 2023, [[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict | Azerbaijan]] launched a significant attack on the Armenian-inhabited breakaway region of [[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict | Nagorno-Karabakh]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Within a day, the territory had surrendered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Following this, tens of thousands of ethnic Armenians began to leave the area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. While [[armenias_response_and_perspective_on_the_conflict | Armenia]] has described this mass exodus as ethnic cleansing, [[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict | Azerbaijan]] maintains that departures are voluntary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Defining Ethnic Cleansing and its Application

The terms 'genocide' and 'ethnic cleansing' are relatively recent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. While genocide is clearly defined by the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide as acts committed with intent to destroy a national, ethnical, racial, or religious group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, 'ethnic cleansing' is surprisingly recent and ill-defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

The most widely accepted description of ethnic cleansing emerged in the 1990s during the wars in former Yugoslavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. In 1992, a UN commission of experts defined it as:
> "rendering an area ethnically homogeneous by using force or intimidation to remove persons or given groups from the area" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

Methods include murder, torture, sexual assaults, severe injury, confinement in ghettos, forcible displacement, deliberate military attacks or threats on civilians, and destruction of property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. However, determining if ethnic cleansing has occurred is not always straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. The recent conflict in [[azerbaijan_and_armenian_conflict_in_nagornokarabakh | Nagorno-Karabakh]] has brought this debate to [[international_response_to_kurdish_issues | international attention]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### Historical Context of the Conflict

The [[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict | conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh]] has a long and complex history rooted in a mountainous region predominantly inhabited by ethnic Armenians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Following the Soviet Union's incorporation of the Caucasus, [[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict | Nagorno-Karabakh]] was granted autonomy within [[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict | Azerbaijan]] as the [[azerbaijan_and_armenian_conflict_in_nagornokarabakh | Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] in the early 1920s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

Upon the Soviet Union's collapse, [[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict | Nagorno-Karabakh]] declared independence and, supported by [[armenias_response_and_perspective_on_the_conflict | Armenia]], fought a three-year war against [[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict | Azerbaijan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. This resulted in Armenian forces controlling [[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict | Nagorno-Karabakh]] and surrounding Azerbaijani districts, leading to the displacement of up to a million ethnic Azeris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. [[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict | Azerbaijan]] has long referred to this as ethnic cleansing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

Despite UN Security Council recognition of [[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict | Azerbaijan's]] sovereignty over [[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict | Nagorno-Karabakh]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, years of [[international_response_to_kurdish_issues | international]] negotiation attempts failed to reach a final agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

By the late 2000s, [[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict | Azerbaijan]], enriched by Caspian oil and gas, began building its armed forces, raising fears of a forceful retake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. A new war erupted in September 2020, with [[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict | Azerbaijan]] launching a full-scale attack, seizing occupied districts and moving into [[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict | Nagorno-Karabakh]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Russia brokered a ceasefire, which included a humanitarian corridor between [[armenias_response_and_perspective_on_the_conflict | Armenia]] and [[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict | Nagorno-Karabakh]] overseen by Russian peacekeepers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

In the subsequent period, the [[regional_implications_of_the_armeniaazerbaijan_peace_agreement | European Union]] led efforts to negotiate a final peace agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. [[armenias_response_and_perspective_on_the_conflict | Armenia]] accepted [[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict | Azerbaijan's]] sovereignty but sought autonomy for [[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict | Nagorno-Karabakh's]] inhabitants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. However, [[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict | Azerbaijan]] firmly rejected any special status or self-rule for the [[future_implications_for_armenians_in_azerbaijan | Armenian community]], insisting they would have the same rights as other Azerbaijani citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

Tensions escalated, leading to fighting along the border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a> and, in late 2022, a blockade on [[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict | Nagorno-Karabakh]] by Baku, restricting food, electricity, and humanitarian aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. This deterioration of living conditions was seen by many as an attempt to force [[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict | Nagorno-Karabakh]] into submission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

## International Reactions to the 2023 Offensive

Despite pleas for restraint from the [[regional_implications_of_the_armeniaazerbaijan_peace_agreement | European Union]] and the [[regional_implications_of_the_armeniaazerbaijan_peace_agreement | United States]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>, [[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict | Azerbaijan's]] renewed assault began on 19 September 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

### Diplomatic Condemnation and Affirmation of Sovereignty

While Baku claimed to be responding to "terrorist provocations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>, [[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict | Azerbaijan's]] actions were met with widespread [[international_response_to_kurdish_issues | international condemnation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Many Western governments strongly criticized the use of force, advocating for a peaceful settlement and protection of civilians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. However, most governments were careful to affirm that they were not questioning [[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict | Azerbaijan's]] sovereignty over [[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict | Nagorno-Karabakh]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

### Armenia's Stance

[[armenias_response_and_perspective_on_the_conflict | Armenia]] strongly condemned the attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. However, Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan quickly made it clear that [[armenias_response_and_perspective_on_the_conflict | Armenia]] would not intervene militarily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. He acknowledged that [[armenias_response_and_perspective_on_the_conflict | Armenia]] was heavily outgunned by [[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict | Azerbaijan]] and that intervention would only lead to a wider war and potential territorial losses for [[armenias_response_and_perspective_on_the_conflict | Armenia]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

## Debate on Ethnic Cleansing

After the rapid surrender of [[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict | Nagorno-Karabakh]], tens of thousands of ethnic Armenians began to flee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Within a week, an estimated 50,000 of the territory's 120,000 inhabitants had entered [[armenias_response_and_perspective_on_the_conflict | Armenia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. This exodus led to claims, notably by the [[armenias_response_and_perspective_on_the_conflict | Armenian]] prime minister, that [[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict | Azerbaijan]] was carrying out ethnic cleansing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

### Azerbaijan's Counter-Narrative

The Azerbaijani government strongly rejected these claims, calling them a "national insult" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Baku insisted its troops were not forcing people to leave, arguing instead that many Armenians were departing voluntarily after being defeated by [[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict | Azerbaijan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. They stated that Armenians were not in danger and were welcome to stay, broadcasting messages to that effect and showing images of police handing out water and talks with [[armenias_response_and_perspective_on_the_conflict | Armenian]] leaders to suggest no mistreatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. However, Azerbaijani police did arrest a former senior [[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict | Nagorno-Karabakh]] leader as he attempted to flee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

### Argument for Ethnic Cleansing

Conversely, many others contend that what is occurring is indeed ethnic cleansing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. They argue that the situation must be viewed broadly, highlighting [[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict | Azerbaijan's]] prior blockade to "starve the [[future_implications_for_armenians_in_azerbaijan | Armenian community]] into submission" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>, followed by a military attack clearly aimed at retaking civilian areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. They point out that [[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict | Azerbaijan]] chose violence over peaceful methods, even after effectively regaining control three years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

Even without systematic forced expulsion, reports of serious atrocities exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. Given the conflict's brutal history and dehumanizing language used by senior Azerbaijani leaders against Armenians, many Armenians feel the risk of retribution is too great, leaving them with no choice but to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

## Prospects for an International Consensus

The two sides hold very different views on whether the events constitute ethnic cleansing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. [[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict | Azerbaijan]] maintains the departures are voluntary, while [[armenias_response_and_perspective_on_the_conflict | Armenia]] asserts that [[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict | Azerbaijan's]] actions made the mass exodus inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

### Lack of Unified International View

An agreed [[international_response_to_kurdish_issues | international]] view on the situation appears unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>, with many countries remaining quiet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. Political alliances make a UN Security Council resolution on the matter improbable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>, although positions from other bodies like the Council of Europe or the European Parliament might emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

### Legal Definitions and Challenges

In the absence of a specific international crime of ethnic cleansing, a definitive legal answer to this debate is unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. The closest legal proceedings might be prosecutions for specific crimes against humanity, and possibly genocide, though many are skeptical of this occurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

## Future Implications for the Armenian Population

The [[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict | conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh]] is now definitively over, with [[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict | Azerbaijan]] having secured a decisive victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. The "Republic of Artsakh," as the area was known to Armenians, no longer exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. While hopes for independence or joining [[armenias_response_and_perspective_on_the_conflict | Armenia]] are gone, questions remain about the future of the [[future_implications_for_armenians_in_azerbaijan | Armenian population in Azerbaijan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

[[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict | The Azerbaijani government]] insists that Armenians are welcome to remain and presumably return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. However, skeptics suggest this is a statement to quell [[international_response_to_kurdish_issues | international criticism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. Ultimately, whether there will be meaningful steps to welcome Armenians back, or if any Armenians will indeed return, remains uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. Given decades of conflict and [[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict | Azerbaijan's]] refusal to outline meaningful self-rule, it is suspected that few Armenians will want to return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

During the [[apartheid_and_the_creation_of_bantustans_in_south_africa | apartheid]] era, South Africa implemented a system of racial segregation that underpinned white minority rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This formal policy of racial segregation became known as [[apartheid_and_the_creation_of_bantustans_in_south_africa | apartheid]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

## Historical Context and Implementation
The policy of [[apartheid_and_the_creation_of_bantustans_in_south_africa | apartheid]] was instituted by the National Party, which came to power in 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Although there had been a long history of discrimination against Black South Africans, including the National Land Act of 1913 which deprived them of land ownership in white-held areas, the National Party formalized these discriminatory practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

Key legislation establishing [[apartheid_and_the_creation_of_bantustans_in_south_africa | apartheid]] included:
*   **Population Registration Act (1950)**: This act required all South Africans to be officially defined as Black, White, or Coloured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   **Group Areas Act (1950)**: This act established separate residential and business areas for different racial groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. It allowed the interior minister to remove non-whites from areas designated for whites only, leading to millions of Black South Africans being forcibly evicted from their lands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

## The Bantustans: A Cornerstone of Apartheid
The Bantustans, also known as homelands, became a central component of the [[apartheid_and_the_creation_of_bantustans_in_south_africa | apartheid]] system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. These were designed to perpetuate [[apartheid_and_the_creation_of_bantustans_in_south_africa | apartheid]] and reinforce its institutionalized racism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

The creation of the Bantustans unfolded over several decades:
*   **Bantu Authorities Act (1951)**: This act granted authority to tribal leaders and councils within the traditional homelands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   **Promotion of Bantu Self-Government Act (1959)**: This legislation laid down the possibility of self-rule for these areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   **Self-governing territories**: In 1963, Transkei became the first of what would eventually be 10 Bantustans in South Africa to be designated a self-governing territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. An additional 10 autonomous homelands were also designated in Southwest Africa (now Namibia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   **Homeland Citizenship Act (1970)**: This act made every Black South African a citizen of one of the homelands, regardless of their current residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Bantu Homelands Constitution Act (1971)**: This crucial step empowered the government to grant independence to any of the homelands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   **Nominally Independent States**: South Africa proceeded to declare four Bantustans "independent":
    *   Transkei (1976) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>
    *   Bophutatswana (1977) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>
    *   Venda (1979) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>
    *   Ciskei (1981) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>
    These were known as the "TBVC States" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

The domestic effects of this policy were severe: every Black South African assigned citizenship to an independent Bantustan instantly became a foreigner in South Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. For example, Bophutatswana was made up of disparate territories across northern South Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

## International Condemnation
The creation of the Bantustans and the broader policies of [[apartheid_and_the_creation_of_bantustans_in_south_africa | apartheid]] attracted considerable [[international_condemnation_of_apartheid_policies | International condemnation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. The [[international_condemnation_of_apartheid_policies | International Community never recognised these four so-called states]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

*   In November 1971, the UN General Assembly condemned the creation of the self-governing Bantustans and the forcible relocation of people, arguing that these policies were designed to set one tribe against another and weaken the rights of Black Africans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   A subsequent General Assembly resolution called upon all governments and organizations not to deal with any institutions of the Bantustans or accord them any form of recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
*   After the Republic of Transkei was declared independent in 1976, the General Assembly again condemned the move and called on UN members not to recognise them as states or have any dealings with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. The Security Council reiterated this position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
*   No UN member recognized these new entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Even Lesotho, which shared a border with Transkei, resisted South African pressure to recognize it, a stance praised by the UN Security Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

International condemnation emerged because these policies were deliberately designed to thwart the human rights and self-determination of the majority Black population of South Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. The existence of the Bantustans emanated from a desire to support the racist policy of [[apartheid_and_the_creation_of_bantustans_in_south_africa | Apartheid]], which was judged to be a crime against humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

## The End of Apartheid and Reintegration
The system of [[apartheid_and_the_creation_of_bantustans_in_south_africa | apartheid]] began to crumble in the late 1980s due to decades of pressure and increasingly tight sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

*   In 1990, the 10 self-governing Bantustans in Southwest Africa disappeared when South Africa withdrew, and Namibia became independent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
*   South Africa moved towards a post-[[apartheid_and_the_creation_of_bantustans_in_south_africa | apartheid]] era, with multi-party talks leading to an interim constitution for a multi-racial democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
*   The UN General Assembly called on the new South African government to secure the peaceful reincorporation of the homelands into the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

While Transkei and Venda, under military rule, accepted the decision, Ciskei and Bophutatswana initially resisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. However, facing a strike by civil servants and military mutiny, Lucas Mangope, president of Bophutatswana, fled on March 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. The South African government appointed an interim administrator, and Ciskei also accepted reincorporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

On April 27, 1994, the first day of the interim constitution, the South African Parliament repealed the legislation that had created the Bantustans, including the four nominally independent ones and the six others under South African rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. The new constitutional order applied to all parts of the country, making South Africa a united state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

In conclusion, the Bantustans represent a unique case in [[International Relations in Africa | international relations]]: a country giving independence to parts of its territory, only for that independence to be rejected by the wider international community due to its cynical design to support a racist system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

After two decades in power, questions have arisen about the future of [[erdogans_rise_to_power_and_political_career | Turkey's long-standing president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:09">[01:35:09]</a>. While officially due to step down in 2028, and having previously indicated a wish to retire, there are suspicions that [[erdogans_political_strategies_and_authoritarianism | he may now be trying to prolong his term in office]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:29">[01:48:29]</a>. However, another possibility is that [[erdogans_policies_and_influence | Erdogan]] is preparing to hand over power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:39">[01:54:39]</a>. Given his age and increasing frailty, some believe [[erdogans_policies_and_influence | Erdogan]] may be unable to continue for much longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:28">[10:24:28]</a>. In this scenario, recent political events might be an attempt by [[erdogans_political_strategies_and_authoritarianism | Erdogan to clear the way for a successor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:39">[10:31:39]</a>.

## Potential Successors from Erdogan's Family

Drawing parallels with Azerbaijan, where power transferred between generations of the same family, attention has focused on [[erdogans_policies_and_influence | Erdogan's family members]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:04">[10:55:04]</a>.

### Bilal Erdogan (Son)
Bilal Erdogan, [[erdogans_policies_and_influence | Erdogan's]] second son, is often mentioned as a potential successor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:01">[11:05:01]</a>. While known in Turkey and having ties to Islamist and conservative groups, he has not actively participated in politics, focusing instead on business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>. There is little indication that [[erdogans_political_strategies_and_authoritarianism | Erdogan has been grooming him for power]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:09">[11:23:09]</a>.

### Berat Albayrak (Son-in-Law)
For many years, Berat Albayrak, married to [[erdogans_policies_and_influence | Erdogan's]] daughter Esra, was seen as the natural successor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:04">[11:32:04]</a>. He served as Energy Minister and then Finance Minister under [[erdogans_administration_and_changing_political_outlook | Erdogan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:27">[11:39:27]</a>. However, he resigned in 2020 following policy failures and clashes with other government figures, subsequently stepping out of public attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:11">[11:46:11]</a>.

### Selçuk Bayraktar (Son-in-Law)
Currently, many suggest Selçuk Bayraktar, [[erdogans_policies_and_influence | Erdogan's]] other son-in-law, as a potential candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:56:06">[11:56:06]</a>. He has gained national prominence as the head of a successful military drone manufacturer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:16">[12:02:16]</a>. His company's drones are among Turkey's most successful technology exports, making him highly respected and popular, especially in nationalist circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:27">[12:09:27]</a>. A key challenge is his lack of government experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:19:35">[12:19:35]</a>.

## Trusted Allies Beyond the Family

Besides family, other figures outside the immediate circle are considered potential successors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:49">[12:24:49]</a>.

### Hakan Fidan (Foreign Minister)
Hakan Fidan, the Foreign Minister, is frequently mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:43">[12:29:43]</a>. Having previously served as the head of the intelligence service, he is regarded as a close and trusted ally of [[erdogans_policies_and_influence | Erdogan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:02">[12:34:02]</a>. Notably, he is not a member of the AKP, though this could change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:39:27">[12:39:27]</a>.

## Implications for Turkey's Future

Recent events in Turkey, such as the arrest of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoğlu on corruption charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, might not only be about [[erdogans_political_strategies_and_authoritarianism | Erdogan preserving his own political power]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:34">[12:47:34]</a>. Instead, they could be part of a broader effort to pave the way for political control to pass to a designated successor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:19">[12:54:19]</a>. This transition could occur in 2028 during the next scheduled elections, or [[erdogans_political_strategies_and_authoritarianism | Erdogan]] might seek another presidential run to buy more time for a formal successor to be prepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:10">[13:02:10]</a>. The choice of successor will be crucial for [[the_transformation_of_turkey_under_erdogans_leadership | Turkey's future direction]] for many years to come <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:22:20">[13:22:20]</a>.

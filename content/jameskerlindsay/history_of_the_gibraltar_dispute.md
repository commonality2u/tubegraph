## Introduction
The status of Gibraltar, a strategically vital territory, has been a subject of dispute between Britain and Spain for over 300 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. While for decades, [[anglospanish_relations_over_gibraltar | Anglo-Spanish relations]] had found ways to minimize disruption concerning Gibraltar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, Britain's decision to leave the European Union profoundly impacted the situation, prompting new [[negotiations_and_agreements_concerning_gibraltar | negotiations and agreements concerning Gibraltar]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## What is Gibraltar?
Gibraltar is a small rocky peninsula located at the southern tip of Spain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. It measures 5 kilometers long by 1.2 kilometers wide (3 miles by 3/4 of a mile), with a total area of just 6.8 square kilometers (2.6 square miles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Its current population is 32,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Gibraltar holds a crucial strategic position overseeing the western entrance of the Mediterranean Sea and continues to host a British naval base and an air base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Early History
Gibraltar boasts an exceptionally long history, with archaeological evidence suggesting Neanderthal habitation around 40,000 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. In ancient times, it was known to the Phoenicians, Carthaginians, and Greeks, who called it one of the Pillars of Hercules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. It later fell under Roman control during the Empire's expansion into Iberia (modern-day Spain and Portugal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

After falling to the Visigoths in the 5th century, Gibraltar was conquered by the Umayyad Arab Muslims in 711 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Led by Tariq ibn Ziyad, the Rock was named Jabal Tariq, meaning "Mountain of Tariq" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. For several centuries, it remained under Muslim Moorish rule, becoming heavily fortified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. As Spain gradually pushed back against Islamic control, Gibraltar changed hands multiple times until it was finally captured by the Kingdom of Castille in 1462, eventually becoming part of a united Spanish Kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## Spanish Rule and the War of Spanish Succession
For the next two and a half centuries, Gibraltar remained under Spanish rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. This changed at the start of the 18th century with the War of Spanish Succession, sparked by the death of the Habsburg King of Spain, Charles II, without an heir in November 1700 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. This war pitted France and parts of Spain (supporting a Bourbon claimant) against Austria, the Dutch Republic, and Britain (supporting a Habsburg) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

On August 4, 1704, a combined British and Dutch fleet, commanded by British Admiral Sir George Rooke, seized Gibraltar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Although initially taken in the name of the Habsburg claimant, Britain retained control when the war ended in 1711 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Two years later, in 1713, the Treaty of Utrecht was signed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. Despite Spanish opposition, Article X of the treaty ceded Gibraltar to Britain "forever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. Crucially, the treaty stipulated that if Britain ever wished to relinquish sovereignty, Spain would have the first right of refusal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

## British Consolidation and Strategic Importance
Spain, however, refused to accept the loss of Gibraltar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. Britain steadily reinforced its position, leading to a major confrontation in 1779 when Spanish and French forces laid siege to Gibraltar during the American War of Independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Despite repeated assaults, they failed to break through and eventually withdrew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

Having cemented its control, Gibraltar's significance to Britain grew, particularly with the expansion of its naval power in the 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 further boosted its importance, making Gibraltar a central element of Britain's imperial standing by creating a new route to India through the Mediterranean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Beyond its military role, it also became a vital trading station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

During both the First and Second World Wars, Gibraltar played a crucial role in controlling access to the Mediterranean and protecting British shipping routes and supplying Allied forces in North Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

## Decolonization and Increased Spanish Pressure
The end of the Second World War brought a shift in the debate over Gibraltar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Despite its continued strategic importance, the era of decolonization brought Gibraltar's status into the international spotlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. The newly established United Nations placed Gibraltar on its list of Non-Self-Governing Territories, initiating a formal debate about its future sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

Spain became increasingly active on the matter, and throughout the 1950s and 60s, the Spanish Government under dictator General Franco intensified pressure on Britain to relinquish control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Britain, however, maintained that the people of Gibraltar had a right to self-determination and refused to discuss the matter without considering the Gibraltarians' wishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. In a 1967 referendum, 99% of Gibraltarians voted to remain under British sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

In line with UN calls for greater autonomy, a new constitution was unveiled in 1969, granting Gibraltar more control over its governance and establishing a parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Infuriated by these changes, Madrid imposed harsh restrictions, including closing the land border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. This had significant economic and social consequences, as Gibraltarians could no longer freely travel to Spain for work, shopping, or to see friends and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

## Thawing Relations and EU Membership
While [[anglospanish_relations_over_gibraltar | Anglo-Spanish relations]] remained strained for several years, the situation began to improve following General Franco's death in the early 1970s and Spain's return to democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. In 1980, the sides reached the Lisbon Statement, committing to resolving the matter in friendship and cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. However, differing interpretations of the statement—Spain seeing it as paving the way for sovereignty discussions and Britain as ending restrictions—limited progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

A new initiative, the Brussels Process, began in 1984 to facilitate Spain's forthcoming EU membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. This reinforced the message of dialogue and saw Spain lift its blockade on Gibraltar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. Despite Spain joining the European Union in 1986, difficulties persisted over border control, airspace, and territorial waters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. Even the creation of the European Single Market in 1993 and the introduction of the Schengen Area, which allowed for borderless travel across much of Europe, did little to ease matters as Gibraltar was excluded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Spain also used its EU membership to raise concerns about Gibraltar's low taxation and financial regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

## Joint Sovereignty Proposal and Rejection
By the turn of the millennium, Britain and Spain began considering ideas for possible joint sovereignty over Gibraltar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. However, this proposal was short-lived. A 2002 referendum overwhelmingly rejected the idea, with 98.9% of Gibraltarians voting for continued exclusive British rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

## Cordoba Agreement
Despite this setback, practical progress continued. In 2006, the Cordoba Agreement was signed, introducing improvements such as easier border crossings and more flights from Gibraltar’s airport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Crucially, it acknowledged the right of Gibraltarians to be included in discussions on their future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

## Impact of Brexit
Everything changed in June 2016 when Britain held a referendum on EU membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. While Gibraltar overwhelmingly voted to remain in the European Union (recognizing the complications of leaving), Britain narrowly voted to depart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

As [[impact_of_brexit_on_gibraltar | Brexit]] negotiations began, it became clear that separate discussions would be needed to manage complex issues arising for the three British territories with a land border with the EU: Gibraltar, Northern Ireland ([[history_of_irelands_partition_and_conflict | Ireland's partition and conflict]]), and the British Sovereign Bases in Cyprus ([[historical_background_of_cyprus_conflict | Cyprus conflict]], [[historical_context_of_cyprus_geopolitical_position | Cyprus geopolitical position]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

A primary concern was freedom of movement and border checks. Within the EU, the frontier was open for people, goods, and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. With the UK and Gibraltar outside the EU, this would change, despite approximately 15,000 people crossing the border daily, many for work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. Introducing full border checks would be hugely disruptive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. [[impact_of_brexit_on_gibraltar | Brexit]] also created a range of economic, trade, financial, and legal problems for Gibraltar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

## Current Negotiations
On December 31, 2020, just a month before Brexit, Britain and Spain reached an initial framework agreement for Gibraltar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. This agreement stipulated that any full agreement would consider Gibraltar's geographical situation, international legal status, special circumstances, and relationship with Spain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

While this established a broad framework, the exact details have proven extremely difficult to settle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. Although the EU authorized negotiations in July 2021, progress has been slow, and a final agreement has yet to be found, despite reports of a deal being imminent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. Securing a final deal will be an early foreign policy task for Britain's new Labour government, which took power on July 5, 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

## The Core Dispute
Even if a deal helps the day-to-day situation on the ground, it will not resolve the fundamental point of difference between Britain and Spain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

*   **Britain's Position**: The UK views the issue through the principle of self-determination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. The British Government emphasizes that any change in Gibraltar's status must be approved by its residents, who continue to desire to remain under British rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. As long as this remains the case, Britain is likely to defend Gibraltar as a British territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

*   **Spain's Position**: Spain maintains its claim to sovereignty over the territory, arguing that it has a historical claim to the Rock, which it believes was unfairly seized in the early 18th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. While the Spanish Government has expressed willingness to accept some form of joint sovereignty, Gibraltarians continue to reject this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

## Conclusion
Ultimately, reconciling these opposing positions appears difficult, at least for now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. Following Britain's decision to leave the European Union, which exacerbated previously managed problems, the key challenge is to find a way to minimize points of friction for Gibraltarians, London, and Madrid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. In this sense, disputes are sometimes not settled but perpetually managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

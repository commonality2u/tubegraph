## The International Stance on Secession

The international community generally has a deep aversion to secession, particularly when it is unilateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This contemporary thinking on secession largely evolved over several decades after 1945 and the founding of the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Key developments influencing these attitudes can be traced back to two specific cases of separatism in Africa during the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

Previously, the principle of respecting the territorial integrity of states primarily applied to threats from other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. However, cases like Katanga's attempt to break away from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and later the [[biafran_independence_movement | Biafran War]], solidified the idea that this principle also applies to internal attempts to secede <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## The Biafran War (Nigerian Civil War)

The [[biafran_independence_movement | Biafran War]], also known as the Nigerian Civil War, was one of the most brutal conflicts of modern times, causing over a million deaths and millions more displaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Although largely forgotten today, it significantly shaped global thinking on secession and independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. When it took place in the late 1960s, it was considered the humanitarian tragedy of its era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Over its three-year span, well over a million people died from direct fighting or indirectly from famine and illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

### Background of Nigeria

Nigeria, located in West Africa, is the 31st largest UN member by area and the most populous country in Africa, with an estimated 200 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. It is extremely diverse, comprising over 250 different ethno-linguistic groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. The three main groups are:
*   **Hausa and Fulani:** Around 30% of the population, mainly in the north <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Yoruba:** Around 20% of the population, from the south-west <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   **Igbo:** Around 20% of the population, from the south-east <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

The origins of the conflict trace back to the European colonial scramble for Africa in the mid-19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. After capturing Lagos in 1851 and gaining other territories in the Berlin Conference of 1885, Britain established the Southern Nigerian Protectorate and Northern Nigerian Protectorate in 1900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. The crucial moment was in 1914 when, due to a budget deficit in the North, the two protectorates were merged to form the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This decision, primarily for economic reasons, created an entity fundamentally at odds with itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

### Path to Conflict

After the Second World War, as Britain prepared for decolonisation, Nigeria was reconstituted as the Federation of Nigeria in 1954 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. This federation comprised three regions broadly mapping to the main ethnic groups: Hausa-Fulani Northern Nigeria, Igbo Eastern Nigeria, and Yoruba Western Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Nigeria gained independence on October 1, 1960, joining the United Nations shortly after <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

Tensions escalated after the disputed 1964 post-independence general election, which saw the Northern People's Congress win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. On January 15, 1966, junior military officers, mainly from the southern Igbo ethnic group, launched a coup attempt, assassinating 22 senior political and military figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Though quickly defeated, its effects were widely felt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

A counter-coup on July 28, 1966, by northern army officers, led to the execution of several hundred southerners, mostly ethnic Igbo, in reprisal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Attacks on Igbo living in the north intensified, with an estimated 10,000 to 30,000 people murdered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. This sparked a mass exodus of up to 2 million Igbo people fleeing south to the safety of the Igbo-dominated Eastern Region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

With the country in crisis, talk of eastern secession grew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. In January 1967, a British-organized peace conference in Ghana between Nigerian leader Colonel Yakubu Gowon and Eastern Province leader Colonel Odomegwu Ojukwu led to the "Aburi Accord" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. However, a dispute arose over its interpretation; Ojukwu viewed it as paving the way for a loose confederation, while the central government rejected this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. In May 1967, to weaken the East, which was also a center of Nigeria's oil production, the government announced the country would be reconstituted into 12 states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

On May 30, 1967, Ojukwu responded by unilaterally declaring independence, formally proclaiming the creation of the Republic of Biafra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. Just over a month later, on July 6, 1967, the federal government declared war on the breakaway province <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

### War and Aftermath

The [[biafran_independence_movement | Biafran War]] lasted 30 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. The Nigerian army made considerable headway, aided by non-Igbo areas in the East siding with the federal government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Biafran-controlled territory shrank by a third by August 1967 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. In October, the Biafran capital, Enugu, fell, forcing the administration to relocate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. The most significant blow came in May 1968 when the government took control of Port Harcourt, imposing a blockade on Biafra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. This led to a devastating famine that killed well over a million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

By the end of 1969, the conflict was all but lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. In early 1970, Ojukwu fled, and on January 15, the war officially ended when the chief of the Biafran Army declared the Republic of Biafra had ceased to exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. General Gowon, head of the military government, gave a speech stating there was "no victor, no vanquished" to begin national reconciliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Nigeria has since tried to forget the civil war, though pro-Biafran sentiment still exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

### International Response to Biafran Secession

The [[international_responses_to_the_biafran_secession | Biafran War]] had a huge international impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Publicly, the Biafran cause garnered massive sympathy, especially after images of starving Biafran children emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. This led to a major international humanitarian effort, the Biafran Airlift, by various non-governmental organizations and church groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

Officially, Biafra received a degree of support:
*   **Recognition:** Five UN members recognized Biafra as an independent state: Tanzania (April 13, 1968), Gabon, Ivory Coast, Zambia, and Haiti (the only non-African state) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   **Covert Assistance:** Behind the scenes, Biafra enjoyed support and military assistance from Spain, Portugal, Rhodesia, South Africa, Israel, and France, all of whom saw a weakened Nigeria as potentially beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

However, these were outliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. The vast majority of the international community supported the [[role_of_the_nigerian_government_in_separatist_movements | Nigerian government]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. African states, in particular, viewed the developments with grave concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. Many had recently become independent within colonial borders that often forced diverse ethnic groups together, and they saw Biafra's secession as an existential threat to their own territorial integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. The Organization of African Unity (forerunner of the African Union) played a key role in rallying regional and international support for Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

Two countries were particularly strong Nigerian allies:
*   **Britain:** Driven by a desire to prevent the recognition of Rhodesia's 1965 unilateral declaration of independence, and seeking to protect its significant oil investments in Nigeria, believing Nigeria would win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
*   **Soviet Union:** Saw the war as an opportunity to win over Nigeria, which had long been seen as a strong opponent of communism in sub-Saharan Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

The United States largely steered clear, viewing it as an internal affair and wishing to avoid entanglement while fighting in Vietnam, remaining neutral and not supplying arms to either side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

The Biafran attempt to break away, despite limited support, served to cement the idea that states should not recognize unilateral secession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. It underscored the emerging idea that states should respect one another's territorial integrity not only against external aggression but also against internal separatist threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.

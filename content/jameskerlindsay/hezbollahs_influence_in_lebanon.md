Hezbollah's presence and growing influence are significant factors in Lebanon's current instability and the [[potential_for_conflict_in_lebanon | country's brink of collapse]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Background and Status

Hezbollah is an Iranian-backed group that remained present in Lebanon after the civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. Syria also maintains influence in Lebanon through its links to Hezbollah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. The group has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States, the European Union, and many Arab states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

## Current Influence in Lebanon

In recent years, Hezbollah has gained significant ground within Lebanon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>:
*   **"State within a State"**: It has established what is described as its own "state within a state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
*   **Military Power**: Hezbollah is considered one of the most heavily armed non-state actors in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
*   **Political Representation**: The group holds seats in the Lebanese parliament and has ministers in the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
*   **Institutional Control**: Hezbollah currently exerts control over many Lebanese institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

## Wider Implications

The growing influence of Hezbollah has significant implications, both domestically and internationally:
*   **Potential Takeover**: Some analysts suggest that Hezbollah may even attempt to take over the country completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
*   **Confrontation with Israel**: A complete state collapse in Lebanon could provide an opportunity for Hezbollah to seize control, which would significantly raise the chances of a major confrontation or war with Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

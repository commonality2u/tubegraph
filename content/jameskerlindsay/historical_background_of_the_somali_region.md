The Horn of Africa has recently seen a dramatic flare-up of fighting in Somaliland, a region long considered one of the most stable parts of the area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This conflict has resulted in hundreds of deaths and displaced over 200,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The unrest also impacts Somaliland's ongoing efforts to gain international acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## The Somali People and Their Divisions

The Somali people are primarily located across the Horn of Africa, forming the majority in Somalia, Somaliland, and Djibouti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Significant Somali communities also reside in eastern Ethiopia and Northern Kenya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Additionally, extensive Somali diaspora communities exist across the Middle East, Europe, and North America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

Despite sharing a common language, religion, and culture, Somalis are divided by a highly complex clan system centered on five main groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>:
*   **Darod**: The largest group, forming an arc from Kenya through Ethiopia, Somaliland, and northern Somalia's Puntland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   **Hawiye**: Found in eastern Somalia, northern Kenya, and southern Ethiopia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Rahanweyn**: Located in central Somalia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Dir**: Predominantly in northern Somaliland and Djibouti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   **Isaaq**: Comprise the majority in Somaliland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

These main clans further subdivide into numerous sub-clans, such as the Majeerteen, Dhulbahante, and Wasangeli in the north, which are part of the Harti clan (a sub-clan of the Darod) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. These groups are the largest in northern Somalia and eastern Somaliland, contributing to current tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Historically, Somalis were among the first non-Arab peoples to embrace Islam, and today, they are almost entirely Sunni Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## Impact of European Colonialism and Decolonization

The modern [[impact_of_european_colonialism_on_somalia | history of the Somali region]] begins in the 19th century with the arrival of [[impact_of_european_colonialism_on_somalia | European colonialism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. The Somali-inhabited areas were divided among three imperial powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>:
*   **France**: Took control of what is now Djibouti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Britain**: Ruled Somaliland and Kenya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **Italy**: Administered much of present-day Somalia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

This colonial arrangement persisted until decolonization began after the Second World War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The [[historical_context_of_somaliland_independence | British Somaliland Protectorate became independent]] on June 26, 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Days later, on July 1, 1960, the Italian-administered trust territory of Somaliland also gained independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. The two parts merged to form the Somali Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

## Challenges of the Somali Republic

The unification was initially welcomed as a step towards uniting the Somali people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>, but problems quickly arose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Somaliland, which considered itself an equal partner, was downgraded in 1961, fueling Isaaq discontent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. In October 1969, the assassination of the country's president led to a military coup, installing General Mohamed Siad Barre as head of state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

Siad Barre's regime aligned Somalia with the Soviet Union, abolished the constitution, banned political parties, and attempted to dismantle the clan system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. His government pursued a nationalist agenda, advocating for the unification of all Somali people within Somalia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. This culminated in the [[historical_tensions_and_conflicts_between_ethiopia_and_somalia | Ogadan War]] in July 1977, when Somali forces invaded eastern Ethiopia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. The war was a disaster for Somalia, as Moscow supported Ethiopia, which also had a Marxist military government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Despite Siad Barre's subsequent switch of allegiance to the United States, the war significantly undermined his power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Opposition grew, particularly in the Isaaq-dominated north, which faced brutal government reprisals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

## Collapse of Somalia and the Rise of Somaliland

In January 1991, Siad Barre was overthrown and fled the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Rather than bringing peace, Somalia's central state quickly disintegrated into factionalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. It was at this point that [[history_of_somalilands_independence_and_secession | Somaliland]] seized the opportunity to reclaim its statehood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. On May 18, 1991, it unilaterally declared independence within the borders of British-controlled Somaliland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. However, it has never been recognized by any UN member state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

Somaliland has operated as a de facto state for over 30 years, gaining widespread acceptance despite its unrecognised status, and building ties with countries like Britain and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Emergence of Puntland and Territorial Disputes

In 1998, a new dynamic emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Following attempts to form a new national government in Mogadishu, the northern part of Somalia, which had largely avoided the violence seen elsewhere, established its own separate administration: the Puntland States of Somalia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

Unlike Somaliland, which sought full independence, Puntland, largely inhabited by the Majeerteen (part of the Harti-Darod clan), rejected secession and called for autonomy within Somalia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Puntland's claim to authority extended beyond existing administrative lines to include all areas inhabited by wider Harti-Darod clan members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. This included not only areas in Somalia like Bari, Nugaal, and northern Mudug, but also Sool, most of Sanaag, and southern Toghder (known as Cayn) â€“ significant parts of Somaliland's three eastern provinces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

This overlapping claim led to a complex series of events and repeated changes of hands in the disputed territory, leading to the current crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   **2002**: Somaliland's president visited Las Anod, capital of Sool, sparking anger among local Dhulbahante inhabitants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Puntland forces attacked the convoy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   **2003**: Puntland seized the Las Anod area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
*   **2007**: Somaliland forces retook control, pushing Puntland troops back to Tukaraq <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **2012**: Many in Sool rejected Somaliland's control and Puntland, forming the Unity and Salvation Authority of Sool, Sanaag, and Cayn militia, proclaiming the autonomous Khatumo State of Somalia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. Khatumo sought self-rule within a federal Somalia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   **2018**: Following peace talks, Khatumo agreed to remain within Somaliland in exchange for government posts, but parts of the local Sool leadership rejected the deal and appealed to Puntland for support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. This led to renewed fighting, with Tukaraq being retaken in January <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Tensions have remained high and spread to Sanaag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

## Recent Conflicts in Las Anod

The most recent fighting escalated in December 2022 after a prominent political figure in Sool was assassinated, leading to anti-government rioting in Las Anod <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. A crackdown by Somaliland security forces resulted in about 20 deaths, fueling further violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Somaliland troops withdrew from the city in January 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

On February 6, local leaders announced they no longer recognized Somaliland's authority, forming a separate Somali federal state called SSC Khatumo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. They rejected Somaliland's "occupation" and appealed to the Somali federal government in Mogadishu for support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. Since then, fighting has intensified, with reports of Somaliland forces shelling the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. This conflict has left hundreds dead and caused massive displacement, with over 60,000 fleeing into [[implications_of_ethiopian_recognition_for_somalia | neighboring Ethiopia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

## Broader Implications and Unresolved Status

This growing crisis around Las Anod represents a significant danger to peace and stability across the Horn of Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. The European Union noted that while international attention focuses on the Somali government's fight against Al-Shabaab, the escalating fighting in Las Anod is a serious concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. It risks not only a full war between Somaliland and Puntland but also further undermining relations between Somaliland and Somalia, potentially igniting a wider clan confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

A core issue contributing to this instability is the inability to secure a long-term solution to the [[impact_of_somalilands_unrecognized_status_on_regional_stability | political status of Somaliland]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. Somaliland argues that the territory is unlawfully trying to secede and that the 1960 boundaries should be respected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. Conversely, the clans claim they are not bound to respect what they see as Somaliland's unlawful secession from Somalia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. The loss of these territories would be a major blow to Somaliland, and its government has no reason to discuss the issue as long as Mogadishu contests its status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. The current fighting is intimately linked to this larger unresolved problem that many, including the EU, recognize needs to be addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. This situation highlights how secessionist conflicts can be far more complex than simple ethno-national or religious group clashes, with communities united by language, culture, and religion still wishing to be apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

Mongolia has become a growing focus of attention for Washington and European capitals in 2023 and 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This attention is seen by many as a concerted Western effort to strengthen relations with the country, which is strategically important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

Mongolia is considered a "pivot state" in contemporary [[international_relations_and_war | international relations]], meaning it is a critical focal point of competition between regional or international powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This status can be attributed to various factors, including its location, economic resources, or broader political and religious influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. The foreign policy decisions of pivot states can have profound effects; for example, aligning with one neighbor can alter a regional balance of power, or remaining neutral can establish them as a buffer or intermediary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Such states can gain greater significance than their size, military strength, or economic standing might suggest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Geographical and Economic Context

Mongolia is situated on the boundary between Central and East Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. It is the world's 18th largest country, with an area of approximately 1.56 million square kilometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. As a landlocked state, it shares borders with Russia to the north and China to the south, east, and west <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. With a population of around 3.4 million, it is one of the most sparsely inhabited countries globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Mining is a vital part of its economy, contributing about a quarter of its gross domestic product and 90% of its exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Mongolia is an important source of coal, copper, gold, tin, and tungsten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## [[mongolias_historical_ties_with_russia_and_china | Historical Ties with Russia and China]]

Mongolia's history is notably associated with the Mongolian Empire, which emerged in the 13th century under Genghis Khan, creating the largest contiguous land empire in human history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. However, this empire fragmented by the end of the 14th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

In 1635, China invaded southern and eastern (Inner) Mongolia, extending control over northern (Outer) Mongolia by the 18th century as it faced threats from the expanding Russian Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. A 1727 treaty between China and Russia solidified Chinese control over Mongolia for nearly 200 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

Mongolia declared independence in 1911 following the overthrow of China's Qing dynasty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. Although China briefly regained control, Mongolian revolutionaries, supported by the newly formed Soviet Union, expelled them in 1921 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. The Mongolian People's Republic was proclaimed in 1924 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. The USSR, despite its role in establishing Mongolia, initially viewed it as part of China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. However, the USSR steadily expanded its influence, eventually turning Mongolia into a Soviet puppet state, highlighted by the 1936 mutual assistance protocol allowing Soviet troop deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

In 1945, at the close of World War II, the Soviet Union finally recognized Mongolia's independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. China's Nationalist government also accepted Mongolia's statehood through the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. The People's Republic of China maintained this agreement, establishing diplomatic relations with Mongolia on October 16, 1949 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

During the Cold War, Mongolia remained one of Moscow's closest allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. While relations with China were initially good, the Sino-Soviet split in the late 1950s and early 1960s caused a collapse in ties, especially after Soviet troops were again stationed in Mongolia in 1966 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. Mongolia joined Comecon, the socialist economic body, but was denied entry into the Warsaw Pact due to Eastern European concerns about antagonizing China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Soviet influence deeply permeated all sectors of Mongolian society, with Russian becoming widely spoken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

## Post-Cold War Shifts and the [[mongolias_third_neighbor_policy | Third Neighbor Policy]]

The late 1980s marked a turning point after nearly 70 years of Soviet control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. Following widespread protests, multi-party democracy was introduced in 1990, leading to the abandonment of the communist system and the dissolution of the Mongolian People's Republic in 1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

The end of the Cold War and the collapse of the USSR profoundly impacted Mongolia's foreign policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. The loss of Soviet support and trade caused a severe economic downturn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. Relations with the new Russian Federation soured when Moscow demanded repayment for all aid received since 1946 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

As a result, Mongolia was compelled to forge new international ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. Washington became a key target after diplomatic relations were established in 1987 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. A partnership and cooperation agreement was signed with the European Union in 1993, and relationships with Japan and South Korea were also established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

The most significant transformation occurred with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. Despite a tense history and lingering mistrust, relations rapidly improved, leading to a Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation in 1994 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. This resulted in a massive expansion of trade and investment, particularly in the mining sector, making China Mongolia's most important economic partner within a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

By the turn of the millennium, relations with Russia also improved dramatically, with many Mongolians still viewing Russia positively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. The debt issue was settled in 2004, and political, economic, and military cooperation steadily strengthened, culminating in a Treaty of Friendship and Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

While close working relations with its two immediate neighbors were recognized as necessary, fears grew that Mongolia was becoming overly reliant on them, especially China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. This led Mongolia to strengthen its [[mongolias_third_neighbor_policy | Third Neighbor Policy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. While maintaining good relations with Russia and China, Mongolia deepened ties with many other countries, including key Western states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. Wide-ranging cooperation with the United States led to a strategic partnership in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. Relationships were also extended with the EU, Japan, India, and Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

## [[impact_of_the_ukraine_war_on_mongolias_diplomatic_stance | Impact of the Ukraine War on Mongolia's Diplomatic Stance]]

The start of the Ukraine war in early 2022 altered Mongolia's comfortable position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. Initially, Mongolia adopted a cautious, neutral approach to the conflict, abstaining from key UN votes condemning the invasion due to concerns about undermining relations with Moscow and relying on Russian energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

Despite continued close links and regular bilateral meetings with Moscow, subtle shifts emerged as the war progressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. In late 2022, Mongolia's president issued a call for peace at the UN General Assembly, seen by many as a nuanced change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

Since early 2023, there has been a significant increase in contacts with Western countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. High-level contacts with the United States have continued, and European countries have shown growing interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.
*   In May 2023, Emmanuel Macron became the first French president to visit Mongolia, a visit explicitly aimed at loosening Russia's control over its neighbors and opening strategic alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
*   In February 2024, Germany became the first EU member to sign a strategic partnership with Mongolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
*   The British Foreign Secretary visited in April 2024, laying the groundwork for a future partnership agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

Reasons for this increased Western engagement are attributed to several factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>:
*   Economic factors: The war in Ukraine has negatively impacted the Mongolian economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
*   Domestic splits: While older Mongolians generally remain positive towards Russia, many younger people prefer the West over Russia and China and support Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.
*   Growing nervousness: There is concern about the increasingly close ties between Beijing and Moscow since the Ukraine war began, as being "squeezed" between two powerful neighbors is different from pivoting between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.

For Western states, this engagement offers the chance to weaken one of Moscow's closest historical partnerships and gain greater access to Mongolia's valuable mining sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

## Current Foreign Policy Outlook

Mongolia is not decisively shifting away from Russia and China towards the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. Its geography prevents it from abandoning its neighbors, and a concerted alignment with the West could lead to disastrous consequences if Beijing and Moscow unite to isolate the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.

Instead, Mongolia appears to be pursuing a foreign policy designed to protect its economic, political, diplomatic, and strategic autonomy while maintaining close ties with Moscow and Beijing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. As its two powerful neighbors grow closer, and Mongolia finds itself increasingly squeezed, it is pivoting more towards its [[mongolias_third_neighbor_policy | Third Neighbor Policy]], engaging with "the rest of the world, including the West" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

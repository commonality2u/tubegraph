Russia's invasion of Ukraine has garnered widespread international condemnation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While some argue that the outrage is merely due to the conflict being in Europe and threatening Western interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, there's a deeper legal and political significance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This war represents an unprecedented challenge to the entire system of modern [[international_relations_and_conflicts_influenced_by_kosovo | international relations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

Russia has faced a "huge barrage of criticism" on the world stage, including widespread sanctions and a General Assembly resolution supported by 141 of 193 UN members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## [[comparison_of_global_conflicts_and_media_attention | Comparisons to Other Conflicts]]

Despite the widespread opposition, the conflict has led to [[media_coverage_and_international_attention_on_conflicts | comparisons]] with other major invasions of modern times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, such as:
*   The US-led invasions of Afghanistan (2001) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   The US-led invasion of Iraq (2003) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   The NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia (1999) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>

While these conflicts share some similarities, Russia's actions in Ukraine represent something substantively different from anything seen since the end of the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. It could be the most fundamental challenge to the established international order since the Second World War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Core Principles of International Politics

To understand the unique nature of this conflict, it's essential to consider three interlinked, yet separate, concepts that underpin international politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>:
1.  Sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>
2.  Territorial Integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>
3.  Political Independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>

Other invasions may have violated one or two of these principles, but Russia's actions in Ukraine challenge all three in an unprecedented manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### Sovereignty

Sovereignty is the universally understood right of countries to determine what happens within their borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. This principle emerged in the mid-17th century and underpins modern statehood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. The principle of non-interference in the domestic affairs of other states remains the foundation of the modern international order and is enshrined in the UN Charter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

By definition, all invasions by one state or a group of states against another violate a country's sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. This applies to cases like Iraq, Libya, Serbia, Kuwait, Afghanistan, Cyprus, and Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Terms like "peace interventions" or "special operations" are merely sanitised descriptions of invasions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

### Territorial Integrity

Territorial integrity is another fundamental principle enshrined in the UN Charter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. It means that states have a responsibility to respect one another's defined physical boundaries, whether land borders or maritime limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Wars of territorial conquest are rare in modern times, with few examples where a country seeks to conquer and claim another state's territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Formal annexation of conquered territory has been largely unknown for most of the modern era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

*   **Iraq and Afghanistan**: The US invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan did not result in any border changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Both countries preserved their territorial integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>, even though their sovereignty was violated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   **Yugoslavia/Kosovo**: The NATO campaign against Yugoslavia eventually led to [[international_relations_and_conflicts_influenced_by_kosovo | Kosovo]]'s unilateral declaration of independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. This outcome did violate Serbia's territorial integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>, though it was not aimed at annexation by any protagonist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. A condition for Kosovo's independence was that it would not unite with neighbouring Albania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Thus, [[international_relations_and_conflicts_influenced_by_kosovo | Kosovo]] represented a violation of Serbia's sovereignty and territorial integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   **Russia-Ukraine**: Russia's violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity is "absolutely clear-cut" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Russia invaded and annexed Crimea in 2014, despite having recognized Ukraine's borders upon its independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Russia has also recognized the independence of Luhansk and Donetsk, with the expectation that these areas will be incorporated into the Russian Federation if Russia succeeds in overrunning Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Therefore, Russia has violated both Ukraine's sovereignty and its territorial integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

### Political Independence

Political independence is also explicitly stated in the UN Charter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. It can mean the existence of a state as a sovereign entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Invasions aimed at the formal extinction of a state are rare, as international law no longer accepts conquest as a legitimate basis for state extinction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   **Iraq-Kuwait**: The best modern example of an attempt to wipe out a sovereign state was Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   **Western Interventions**: Major Western interventions did not see states cease to exist; Iraq, Afghanistan, and Yugoslavia (later Serbia) all continued as UN member states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
*   **Russia-Ukraine**: Russia has suggested that the very existence of an independent Ukrainian state may be at stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. President Putin has stated that he regards Russians and Ukrainians as one people, and openly declared Ukraine's future as an independent state is at risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

Political independence also refers to the extent to which a state controls the decisions made within its borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   **Regime Change**: Many invasions aim at regime change, which challenges a state's political independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. The US and its partners sought to remove the Taliban from Afghanistan and Saddam Hussein from Iraq, violating both countries' political independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. In contrast, regime change was never NATO's goal in Yugoslavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   **Russia-Ukraine**: In Ukraine, regime change is on the agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Putin has justified the war by stating Ukraine needs to be "demilitarized and de-Nazified" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Even without full annexation, there is an expectation that Moscow will install a puppet regime, potentially drawing Ukraine into a confederal arrangement with Russia similar to Belarus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

## Unprecedented Challenge

> [!INFO] Russia's actions are uniquely threatening to the international system because they violate all three fundamental principles of modern international relations:
> *   **Sovereignty**: Like all invasions, Russia has violated Ukraine's right to control its territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
> *   **Territorial Integrity**: Unlike the US-led invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, Russia has annexed territory (Crimea) and plans further annexations (Luhansk, Donetsk), directly violating Ukraine's borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
> *   **Political Independence**: Unlike the NATO action against Serbia (which respected its independence despite territorial impact), Russia intends to abolish Ukraine's independence by seeking regime change and potentially extinguishing it as a sovereign entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

## Implications for the International System

While these principles may seem academic, they represent the fundamental rules of the international system, governing how countries understand the limits of their behaviour towards one another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. Russia's actions are "ripping up the rule book entirely" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a> by violating every principle that underpins this system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. The fact that Russia is a permanent member of the Security Council and is using threats of nuclear retaliation exacerbates the disturbance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

Although other interventions may deserve condemnation, Russia's invasion goes "far beyond anything we've seen before" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. It has the potential to mark a fundamental break with the global political system built over the past 70 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. This system, despite its flaws, has been an improvement on the "might makes right" approach that characterized past world politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

Western states must acknowledge their own role in eroding these rules, even if their justifications were to create democratic states or stop human rights abuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. However, this does not diminish the fact that Russia's actions pose an unprecedented challenge to the foundations of international relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

As [[Erdogans policies and influence | Recep Tayyip Erdogan]] approaches his 70th birthday, and with persistent rumors about his health, questions are growing about the future of Turkey's leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>. Despite having hinted at retirement and being constitutionally unable to stand for a third term in 2028, there are suggestions that [[Recep Tayyip Erdogans political strategy and future | Erdogan]] may be looking for ways to circumvent these restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>.

However, an alternative explanation for recent political events, such as the arrest of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoğlu, is that [[Recep Tayyip Erdogans political strategy and future | Erdogan]] might be clearing the way for a designated successor rather than preparing for another presidential run himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>. This strategy of an autocratic ruler grooming a trusted successor has historical precedents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.

## Potential Candidates

Several figures are frequently mentioned as possible successors to [[Erdogans policies and influence | Erdogan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>.

### Family Members

Following a pattern seen in neighboring Azerbaijan, where power passed within the family, attention has focused on [[The influence of Erdogans family and allies on Turkeys politics | Erdogan's family members]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>.

*   **Bilal Erdogan (Second Son)**: While widely known in Turkey and having ties with Islamist and conservative circles, Bilal has taken little active role in politics, focusing instead on business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>. There is little sign that [[Erdogans policies and influence | Erdogan]] has been grooming him for power, making his succession unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>.

*   **Berat Albayrak (Son-in-Law)**: Married to [[The influence of Erdogans family and allies on Turkeys politics | Erdogan's daughter]], Esra, Berat Albayrak served as energy minister and later finance minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>. He was long considered the natural successor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>. However, after his resignation in 2020 due to policy failures and clashes with other government figures, he has slipped from public attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>.

*   **Selçuk Bayraktar (Son-in-Law)**: Bayraktar has risen to national prominence as the head of a highly successful military drone manufacturer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:56:00">[11:56:00]</a>. His company's technology is one of Turkey's most successful exports, making him highly respected and popular, particularly in nationalist circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a>. A potential drawback is his lack of government experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:19:00">[12:19:00]</a>.

### Beyond the Immediate Family

Candidates from outside [[The influence of Erdogans family and allies on Turkeys politics | Erdogan's immediate family circle]] are also being considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:00">[12:24:00]</a>.

*   **Hakan Fidan (Foreign Minister)**: As the former head of the intelligence service, Hakan Fidan is seen as a close and trusted ally of [[Erdogans policies and influence | Erdogan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a>. Notably, he is not currently a member of the Justice and Development Party (AKP), though this could change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:39:00">[12:39:00]</a>.

## Timeline for Succession

The succession could occur in 2028, when the next elections are constitutionally scheduled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>. Alternatively, [[Recep Tayyip Erdogans political strategy and future | Erdogan]] might seek another presidential run to gain more time to formally prepare a successor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>. The recent arrest of Ekrem Imamoğlu is seen as crucial for Turkey's future direction, potentially for decades to come, regardless of whether [[Recep Tayyip Erdogans political strategy and future | Erdogan]] intends to prolong his own rule or pave the way for a successor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15:00">[13:15:00]</a>.

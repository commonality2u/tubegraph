Following a major attack launched by Azerbaijan on 19 September 2023 against the Armenian-inhabited region of Nagorno-Karabakh, the territory surrendered the next day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Since then, tens of thousands of ethnic Armenians have been leaving the area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Within a week, an estimated 50,000 of the territory's 120,000 inhabitants had reached Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. While Armenia has termed this "ethnic cleansing," Azerbaijan maintains that people are leaving voluntarily and are not being forced out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This mass exodus has led to a fierce debate over whether it constitutes ethnic cleansing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

## Azerbaijan's Stance on Armenian Status

Azerbaijan's president, Ilham Aliyev, has explicitly ruled out any special status for Nagorno-Karabakh or self-rule for the Armenian community in general <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Instead, he insists that Armenians residing in the area could have the same rights as any other Azerbaijani citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

The Azerbaijani government has strongly rejected claims of ethnic cleansing, calling such allegations a "national insult" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Baku states that its troops have not been forcing people to leave, asserting that Armenians have decided to depart of their own free will after being defeated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. They view it as a purely voluntary departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

Furthermore, Azerbaijan insists that Armenians are not in danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. They claim to be reassuring Armenians that they are safe, broadcasting messages welcoming Armenians to stay, showing police distributing water to those leaving, and releasing images of talks with Armenian leaders from Nagorno-Karabakh to suggest they have not been mistreated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. However, Azerbaijani police did arrest a former senior Nagorno-Karabakh leader as he attempted to flee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

## Armenian Perspective on the Exodus

Many observers and the Armenian Prime Minister contend that the situation, when viewed broadly, does amount to ethnic cleansing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. They argue that Azerbaijan imposed a blockade to "starve" the Armenian community into submission, then launched a military attack clearly aimed at retaking civilian areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. Azerbaijan chose violence rather than peaceful methods, despite having effectively regained control three years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

Even if there hasn't been a systematic effort by Azerbaijani troops to force people out, reports of serious atrocities have emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. Given the conflict's long and brutal history, and the dehumanizing language often used by senior Azerbaijani leaders against Armenians, many Armenians feel the danger of retribution is too great to risk, leaving them with no choice but to depart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

## Uncertain Future for Armenians

The conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh's status is now over, with Azerbaijan securing a decisive victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. The Republic of Artsakh, as the area was known to Armenians, no longer exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. While hopes for independence or unification with Armenia are gone, significant questions remain about the future of the Armenian population in Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

The critical questions are whether any Armenians will choose to stay and, perhaps more importantly, whether any who have left will ever return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. Although the Azerbaijani government has stated that Armenians are welcome to remain and presumably return, the sincerity of this statement is unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. Sceptics suggest this is merely to quell international criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

Ultimately, the real determinant will be whether there are meaningful steps to welcome Armenians back and if any choose to return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. Many suspect this will not happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. After decades of [[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict|conflict]], and with the question of Nagorno-Karabakh now resolved, it seems unlikely that many Azerbaijanis will mourn the Armenians' departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>. Given Baku's refusal to outline steps for meaningful self-rule, few Armenians are expected to want to return anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. The [[future_of_armenia_and_nagornokarabakh|future of the Armenian population in Azerbaijan]] therefore remains highly uncertain.

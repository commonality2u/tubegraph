The island of Bougainville has a long history of seeking independence from Papua New Guinea (PNG) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Despite having waged a war, secured a peace deal, and held an internationally monitored referendum, formal negotiations for a final separation have been challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The [[bougainville_struggle_for_independence | struggle for independence]] is rooted in a unique cultural identity and significant mineral wealth, which has fueled calls for separation and ongoing disputes with Papua New Guinea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

## Early Calls for Independence and Civil War

Even before Papua New Guinea gained independence in 1975, there were strong calls for Bougainville to become a separate, independent state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>. Many islanders feared economic and political marginalization within the new country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. Bougainville issued its first declaration of independence in 1975, but this was quickly suppressed by the Papuan government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>.

Tensions simmered for years, primarily due to local resentment over the Panguna mine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>. Islanders argued they saw little benefit from the mine's revenues, despite it accounting for a significant portion of Papua New Guinea’s exports (around 45% during the 1970s and 80s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. Growing anger over environmental damage from the mine further fueled discontent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>. By the late 1980s, these grievances led to a rebellion, with the Bougainville Revolutionary Army (BRA) taking up arms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>. A full-scale civil war erupted in 1988 when the government sent in troops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>. The conflict, which led to the closure of the Panguna mine in 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>, included a blockade of the island and worsening humanitarian and human rights situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>.

## The Peace Process and Bougainville Peace Agreement (BPA)

After ten years of fighting, a permanent ceasefire was brokered on April 30, 1998, with the support of New Zealand, Australia, and the Solomon Islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>. The agreement stipulated the withdrawal of Papua New Guinea forces, a return to civilian policing, and amnesty for combatants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>. A peacekeeping force was also established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. The civil war resulted in an estimated 15,000-20,000 lives lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>.

The ceasefire paved the way for formal peace talks, culminating in the comprehensive Bougainville Peace Agreement (BPA), signed in August 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>. The BPA consisted of three key elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>:
*   **Weapons Disposal:** A mechanism to end the conflict by overseeing the disposal of weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>.
*   **Self-Rule:** Granting the territory self-rule under the Autonomous Bougainville Government (ABG), which was created in 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>.
*   **Independence Referendum:** Guaranteeing an independence referendum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>.

## The Independence Referendum

While the BPA improved security, tensions remained, as Bougainvilleans viewed the agreement as a step toward complete independence, while PNG leadership was hesitant to lose such a resource-rich region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>. Nevertheless, in November 2019, Bougainville held its long-awaited independence referendum under international supervision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>. The results were overwhelmingly in favor of independence, with nearly 98% voting to separate from Papua New Guinea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>.

## Post-Referendum Negotiations and Challenges

Following the referendum, the Papua New Guinea government appeared hesitant to accept the result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>. Prime Minister James Marape stated that the referendum was non-binding and required approval from the Papuan Parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>. He suggested that the outcome might be a form of greater economic independence rather than complete political separation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>.

Despite these reservations, negotiations eventually commenced, leading to an eventual agreement on statehood by 2027 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>. However, the sides remain at odds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>. Bougainville's leadership insists on full independence, while the Papuan government is reluctant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>. Papua New Guinea emphasizes that the process must be carefully planned, addressing crucial issues such as economic sufficiency and Bougainville's capacity for self-governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>.

A major point of contention is control over the Panguna mine, which could be a vital revenue source for an independent Bougainville <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>. Bougainville sees Papua New Guinea's concerns as delaying tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>. While PNG's reluctance stems from the emotional and symbolic impact of losing territory and its valuable resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>, it also faces the risk of new unrest if it reneges on independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>.

There are also genuine questions about Bougainville’s economic viability and governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>. Bougainville's leadership views the reopening of the Panguna mine as crucial for long-term financial viability, despite environmental concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>. The international community increasingly expects new states to demonstrate capacity for effective and economically viable governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>. While this suggests a need for careful management of Bougainville's transition, it is perceived by Bougainville as a delay tactic by PNG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>.

## Current Status and Geopolitical Factors

As the 2027 deadline approaches, Papua New Guinea appears reluctant to finalize independence, even risking new unrest by holding onto the island's resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44:00">[11:44:00]</a>. The question remains whether external actors will pressure PNG to honor its commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:00">[11:59:00]</a>.

A significant [[geopolitical_implications_of_bougainville_independence | geopolitical implication]] is China's increasing influence in the Pacific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a>. There is suspicion that an independent Bougainville, with its valuable resources, could fall into China's orbit, as Beijing has indicated willingness to invest in the territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:00">[12:18:00]</a>. While PNG has economic agreements with China, it is also strengthening defense cooperation with the US and Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:00">[12:31:00]</a>. This dynamic influences the willingness of Washington and Canberra to definitively support Bougainville's independence, with both prioritizing long-term stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:00">[12:42:00]</a>. Ultimately, economics and geopolitics will likely determine whether Bougainville becomes the next member of the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>.

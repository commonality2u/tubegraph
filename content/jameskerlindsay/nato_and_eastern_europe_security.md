Fears have been growing that Russia is preparing to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, having amassed over 100,000 troops close to the border and imposing unacceptable conditions for de-escalation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This situation represents a potentially dangerous new phase in the conflict in eastern Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The decision to use armed force carries immense implications, including wider political, economic, domestic, and international factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Ukraine's Aspirations and Russia's Demands

Following its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine was left with several outstanding issues with Russia, including the stationing of nuclear weapons and the status of the Soviet fleet in the Crimean Peninsula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. While Ukraine resolved some issues by transferring missiles to Russia in return for a Russian guarantee to respect its sovereignty and territorial integrity, and agreed to divide the navy, many Ukrainians pushed for closer ties to the West, including [[european_union_and_nato_aspirations_versus_prorussian_sentiment | EU and NATO membership]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

This aspiration came to a head in November 2013 when Ukraine's pro-Russian president blocked an association agreement with the [[european_union_and_nato_aspirations_versus_prorussian_sentiment | EU]], sparking widespread mass protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. As the president fled to Russia, counter-protests arose in the Russian-speaking east and south, leading to Russia's invasion and annexation of Crimea, and support for a separatist insurgency in the Donbas region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. By 2020, the conflict in the east had cost approximately 14,000 lives and displaced 1.5 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Russia also began cementing its control over the east by granting Russian citizenship to its inhabitants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

In December 2021, Moscow presented the United States and NATO with two draft treaties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. These texts outlined terms for a new security relationship and called on NATO to cease any further expansion, specifically to Ukraine or any former part of the USSR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. NATO immediately rejected this demand, insisting that membership is a matter for the organization and the applicants themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. This explicit demand signals increasingly strong Russian resolve over Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

## Russia's Objectives and NATO's Stance

While some argue that Russia's actions are a bluff, the changed context, including Russia's explicit statement that Ukraine's future is tied to Russia and its direct call for NATO to avoid expansion into the former Soviet Union, suggests a serious intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Given NATO's rejection of these calls, it may be difficult for Russia to back down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

Moscow views NATO as a threat and has long argued that NATO promised not to expand into the former Soviet Union at the end of the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Although NATO offered Ukraine the prospect of membership in 2008, this has long since ceased to be a realistic prospect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. An invasion, while potentially deterring NATO enlargement to Ukraine, might also encourage it elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. For example, the president and prime minister of neutral Finland have hinted that NATO membership may be on the agenda if Russia were to act in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Given Finland's 1300-kilometer border with Russia, this would lead to more NATO presence, not less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

A plausible objective for any invasion would be not only to stop NATO's enlargement to Ukraine but also to secure Russia's hold over the territory it already controls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. By invading a large part of eastern Ukraine, Moscow might try to leverage this to formally secure Ukraine's acceptance of Russia's annexation of Crimea and perhaps gain the formal transfer of the Donbas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

## Potential Responses and Consequences

While Russia's forces vastly outnumber those of Ukraine, Kyiv has significantly improved its military capabilities since 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Direct outside military support for Ukraine would be limited; the prospect of going to war with Russia is out of the question for NATO, and Moscow is aware of this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. However, NATO has insisted that any further aggression against Ukraine would have "massive consequences" and carry a "high price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. This point was reiterated by the [[eu_and_natos_response_to_hungarys_policies | European Union]] and U.S. President Biden in a conversation with Putin on December 30, 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

        <p>Ultimately, [[eu_and_natos_response_to_hungarys_policies | EU]] and [[eu_and_natos_response_to_hungarys_policies | NATO]] action would be most effective in the economic sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. Sanctions have already been imposed since 2013, but other areas could be targeted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Energy is one area where decisive action could be taken, as Europe is a key market for Russian natural gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. However, Russia's record gold and foreign exchange reserves provide it with a "war chest" to weather immediate consequences of further sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Putin also recognizes that severe economic measures would impact already high energy prices in Europe, carrying a major domestic political cost for Western countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.</p>
        <p>A frequently suggested measure is for Germany to cancel Nord Stream 2, a gas pipeline bypassing Ukraine to link Russia and Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. While this would hit Russia hard, especially as Germany is Russia's largest market for natural gas, the impact would not be immediate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.</p>

In truth, whether Russia will invade cannot be definitively stated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. An invasion could deter NATO enlargement to Ukraine and provide leverage to secure Russia's existing gains in the east <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. While military costs could be high, Russia knows external intervention is all but impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. The threat of an invasion appears to be very real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. Even if Russia holds off for now and diplomatic efforts succeed, the possibility of eventual military action will likely remain a real prospect for the foreseeable future, impacting [[impact_on_european_security_and_nato | European security and NATO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

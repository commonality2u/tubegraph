In March 2024, [[cubas_economic_crisis_and_protests | protest broke out in Cuba]] due to growing food shortages and energy price rises, a rare display of unrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The Cuban government has since accused the United States of instigating these demonstrations, highlighting the [[uscuba_relations_and_accusations_of_interference | tense relationship between the two countries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. For over 60 years, the US has maintained a complex and embattled relationship with Cuba, often viewing the small island as an existential threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This has led to the imposition of harsh economic, political, and social restrictions, which many see as a vindictive overreaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Imposition and Nature of the Embargo

The US embargo against Cuba began to form after Fidel Castro's government, which came to power in 1959, nationalized various American-owned properties and businesses without compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. In retaliation, the US imposed sanctions and a trade embargo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Washington views Cuba as an autocratic single-party state that denies fundamental democratic and social freedoms and tramples on human rights, while also undermining US interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Economic and Political Consequences

The embargo has had a profound [[cubas_economic_crisis_and_protests | impact on Cuba's economy]] and political landscape:

*   **Reliance on the Soviet Union**: Facing growing economic difficulties and hardening US opposition, Castro turned to the Soviet Union for help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Cuba's dependence on the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact allowed the country to build a good standard of living despite the US economic embargo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   **Post-Soviet Hardship**: Everything changed with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Having lost its benefactor, Cuba faced significant hardships with food, medicine, and fuel shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Havana implemented strict austerity measures and took initial steps to open its economy to tourism, investment, and private enterprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
*   **Increased Self-Sufficiency**: Despite US hopes that the embargo would bring down the Castro regime, Cuba instead became increasingly self-sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **Current Economic Crisis**: The country has sunk into its most severe economic crisis since the end of the Cold War, exacerbated by the pandemic, worldwide inflation, fuel shortages, and the ongoing US embargo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. This has led to a 500% fuel price increase and growing shortages of vital items like baby milk and medicines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, prompting an urgent plea to the United Nations World Food Program for support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

## US Policy and International Reactions

The US position on Cuba has been consistently characterized by condemnation of its lack of democracy and restrictions on human rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Congress has passed legislation further isolating the country and allowing for punitive action against governments and companies doing business with Cuba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. The US has also seen the Cuban leader challenge US authority by providing military and political assistance to rebel groups and left-wing governments across Latin America and Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

However, the US restrictions have been repeatedly condemned by the rest of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Shifting US Administrations and the Embargo

The approach to the embargo has varied across US administrations:

*   **Clinton Administration (late 1990s)**: Adopted a new approach, easing travel restrictions and opening the way for more significant people-to-people contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
*   **Bush Administration (2001)**: Reinforced the embargo and reimposed travel restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   **Obama Administration (2009)**: Paved the way for a thaw in relations, focusing on engagement rather than isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. This led to a historic breakthrough in 2014, with both countries announcing normalization of relations, reopening embassies, easing travel restrictions, and removing Cuba from the state sponsors of terrorism list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. Crucially, the embargo remained in force as it required Congressional approval for lifting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   **Trump Administration (2017)**: Reversed many of the steps taken by Obama and tightened the long-standing embargo, citing ongoing human rights violations and Cuba's support for Venezuela <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Biden Administration**: Did not return to the Obama-era d√©tente despite expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. While some steps were taken to ease travel restrictions, the core of the embargo remained intact, with the US continuing to cite human rights abuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

## Ongoing Tensions and Narratives

The embargo continues to be a central point of contention in [[uscuba_relations_and_accusations_of_interference | US-Cuba relations and accusations of interference]]. Havana portrays the confrontation as a powerful neighbor interfering in its affairs and imposing a punishing embargo for daring to oppose its control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Meanwhile, Washington views the confrontation as efforts to end a crumbling one-party Communist regime that has deprived the people of Cuba of their democratic and human rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. The ongoing economic crisis and the resulting protests further highlight the impact of the long-standing US embargo on the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

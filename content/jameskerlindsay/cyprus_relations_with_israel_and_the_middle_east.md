The island of [[historical_context_of_cyprus_geopolitical_position | Cyprus]], the European Union's most easterly member, has gained international attention for its efforts to provide aid to Gaza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. However, with the growing risk of conflict on the Lebanese-Israeli border, [[historical_context_of_cyprus_geopolitical_position | Cyprus]] has recently faced [[threats_to_cyprus_from_hezbollah | threats of attack]] from the Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This development has highlighted the complex and challenging political environment that [[historical_context_of_cyprus_geopolitical_position | Cyprus]] navigates, caught between distinct regions and geopolitical blocs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Geographical and Political Landscape

[[historical_context_of_cyprus_geopolitical_position | Cyprus]] is located at the far eastern end of the Mediterranean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Its closest neighbors include [[turkey_and_israel_diplomatic_relations | Turkey]] to its north, Syria to its east, Lebanon and Israel to its southeast, and Egypt to its south <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. The island, approximately 9,300 kmÂ² (3,600 square miles), has been divided since the [[cyprus_dispute_and_its_impact | Turkish invasion]] in 1974, with about 36% beyond the effective control of the internationally recognized government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Additionally, Britain maintains two military bases on the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Historical Context of Foreign Policy

[[historical_context_of_cyprus_geopolitical_position | Cyprus]] boasts a rich history spanning Europe and the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, having been ruled by various major civilizations controlling the eastern Mediterranean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. From 1878 until 1955, the island was under British colonial control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

### Independence and Non-Alignment

In 1955, the Greek Cypriot community launched an uprising to end British rule and unite with Greece, while Turkish Cypriots preferred the island to be divided between Greece and [[turkey_and_israel_diplomatic_relations | Turkey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. To prevent conflict between NATO allies Greece and [[turkey_and_israel_diplomatic_relations | Turkey]], [[historical_background_of_cyprus_conflict | Cyprus]] became an independent state in 1960, with shared power between Greek and Turkish Cypriots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Greece, [[turkey_and_israel_diplomatic_relations | Turkey]], and Britain guaranteed its independence, with a right of unilateral military intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

Despite the guarantor powers being NATO members, [[historical_context_of_cyprus_geopolitical_position | Cyprus]] did not join the alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. Instead, under President Archbishop Makarios, it became part of the Non-Aligned Movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. This fostered close ties with Middle Eastern neighbors, including leading Arab states like Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

### Impact of the 1974 Invasion

The breakdown of the constitution in 1963 and the subsequent [[historical_background_of_cyprus_conflict | Turkish invasion]] in July 1974, following a coup sponsored by Greece's military government, profoundly shaped [[historical_context_of_cyprus_geopolitical_position | Cyprus]]'s foreign policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Anti-Western sentiment grew among Greek Cypriots who blamed NATO and the United States for not stopping [[turkey_and_israel_diplomatic_relations | Turkey]], strengthening ties to the Non-Aligned Movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. [[historical_context_of_cyprus_geopolitical_position | Cyprus]] also relied on its Arab neighbors as a valuable voting bloc at the United Nations, as they distrusted [[turkey_and_israel_diplomatic_relations | Turkey]], which had built strong ties with the West and Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

Over decades, [[historical_context_of_cyprus_geopolitical_position | Cyprus]]'s relations with the Arab Middle East strengthened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>, becoming a sanctuary during the Lebanese civil war in the 1980s and an important base for regional businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. In contrast, relations with Israel remained poor, as [[governance_and_political_disagreements_in_cyprus | Nicosia]] sought to avoid antagonizing Arab neighbors, and Israel prioritized its alliance with [[turkey_and_israel_diplomatic_relations | Turkey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

## EU Membership and Shifting Alliances

### Continued Humanitarian Role

[[implications_of_cyprus_eu_membership_on_regional_politics | Cyprus]] joined the European Union in 2004 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>, leading to expectations of a shift away from the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. However, events like the 2006 war in southern Lebanon, where [[historical_context_of_cyprus_geopolitical_position | Cyprus]] became a central hub for international evacuation efforts, solidified its value as an EU outpost for humanitarian and crisis management in the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

This role has again come to the fore with the war in Gaza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. [[historical_context_of_cyprus_geopolitical_position | Cyprus]], working with the EU, US, and other partners, established the [[cyprus_role_in_international_aid_to_gaza | Cyprus Maritime Corridor]] to provide aid to almost 2 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. As tensions escalate between Israel and Hezbollah on the Lebanese border, [[historical_context_of_cyprus_geopolitical_position | Cyprus]] is preparing for another potential regional conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

### Improving Ties with Israel

The election of a religiously oriented government in [[turkey_and_israel_diplomatic_relations | Turkey]] under Recep Tayyip Erdogan in 2002 led to a deterioration of the previously strong [[turkey_and_israel_diplomatic_relations | Turkey-Israel]] relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. This culminated in 2010 when an Israeli raid on a Turkish aid ship caused a collapse in ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

It was at this point that relations between [[historical_context_of_cyprus_geopolitical_position | Cyprus]] and Israel dramatically improved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Following the discovery of natural gas in the Eastern Mediterranean, the two countries signed a maritime boundary agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. With Israel no longer tied to [[turkey_and_israel_diplomatic_relations | Turkey]] and [[historical_context_of_cyprus_geopolitical_position | Cyprus]] adopting a more pro-Western stance, high-level contacts and bilateral agreements rapidly increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Crucially, military cooperation began to develop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>, highlighted by major joint exercises in May 2023 between the [[governance_and_political_disagreements_in_cyprus | Cyprus]] National Guard and Israeli Defense Forces, which were widely understood to simulate a war against Hezbollah in Lebanon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

## Hezbollah Threats and Responses

On June 19, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah warned that if [[historical_context_of_cyprus_geopolitical_position | Cyprus]] allowed Israel to use its airports or bases to attack Lebanon, it would be considered part of the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. This was interpreted by many as a threat of Hezbollah missile or drone attacks against the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

The Cypriot government responded firmly, with President Nikos Christodoulides stating that [[historical_context_of_cyprus_geopolitical_position | Cyprus]] was not involved in planning military conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. EU leaders condemned the [[threats_to_cyprus_from_hezbollah | threats to Cyprus]], emphasizing solidarity and insisting that any attack on [[historical_context_of_cyprus_geopolitical_position | Cyprus]] would be an attack on the entire Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. The EU also conveyed to Iran, Hezbollah's patron, that a strike against [[historical_context_of_cyprus_geopolitical_position | Cyprus]] would carry serious consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

While [[governance_and_political_disagreements_in_cyprus | Nicosia]] has attempted to de-escalate, suggesting Nasrallah's comments might have been aimed at British military bases on the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>, the recent military exercises between Cypriot and Israeli forces suggest [[historical_context_of_cyprus_geopolitical_position | Cyprus]] itself was the primary target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

## Complexities and Future Considerations

The situation raises questions about whether [[historical_context_of_cyprus_geopolitical_position | Cyprus]]'s close ties to Israel are becoming a problem, potentially disrupting its humanitarian role in the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. The Cypriot government maintains that there is no contradiction between its humanitarian role and its good working relations with Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>, arguing that strong ties with Israel can even facilitate humanitarian efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.

[[governance_and_political_disagreements_in_cyprus | Nicosia]] also emphasizes that despite improved relations with Israel, it maintains very close ties with many Arab countries, including neighboring Egypt and increasingly, the Gulf Arab states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. [[historical_context_of_cyprus_geopolitical_position | Cyprus]] is still seen by many in the region as a safe and welcoming neutral territory, attracting property buyers from Israel and Lebanon as a bolt hole from regional uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

Nevertheless, recent events highlight the foreign policy complexities for countries on geopolitical fault lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. While [[historical_context_of_cyprus_geopolitical_position | Cyprus]] is a valuable part of EU humanitarian efforts, its close bilateral relationship with Israel now seemingly puts the country at risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. This may prompt questions about the direction of [[historical_context_of_cyprus_geopolitical_position | Cyprus]]'s foreign policy and whether a recalibration is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. In the interim, these developments underscore how [[historical_context_of_cyprus_geopolitical_position | Cyprus]] has made the EU a frontline actor in the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.

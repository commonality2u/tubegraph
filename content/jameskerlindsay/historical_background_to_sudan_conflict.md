As international attention is largely focused elsewhere, fears are growing about the deteriorating situation in Sudan, which is rapidly becoming the world's worst humanitarian crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Despite millions displaced and many facing starvation, it is often called a "forgotten war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This article provides a historical overview of the events leading to the current conflict.

## Geographical and Demographic Overview

The Republic of Sudan is located in northeast Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. It covers 1.8 million square kilometres (720,000 square miles), making it the world's 15th-largest country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Its eastern coast borders the Red Sea, and it shares land borders with Eritrea to the east, [[ethiopian_political_history_and_conflicts | Ethiopia]] and South Sudan to the south, the Central African Republic, Chad, and Libya to the west, and Egypt to the north <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

The population is estimated to be around 46 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. While almost all Sudanese are Sunni Muslims, the country is ethnically mixed; the majority are Arab, but about a third of the population comprises sub-Saharan African groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

## Early History and Foreign Influence

Sudan's history spans thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. It was once dominated by Ancient Egypt before coming under Christian Nubian rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. By the 17th century, Islam had established a foothold in the northern regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. In the early 19th century, the Ottoman Empire and its Egyptian vassal state expanded their influence into Sudan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

This lasted until 1881, when a revolt led by a local Muslim religious leader erupted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Concerned about the Suez Canal and potential wider spread, Britain intervened to suppress the uprising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## British Colonial Rule and Divisions

Under British colonial rule, efforts were made to integrate the predominantly Arab Muslim northern provinces with the southern provinces, which consisted of sub-Saharan African tribes practicing Christianity and local faiths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

As decolonization gained momentum after the Second World War, deep divisions emerged over Sudan's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. The South was willing to accept a united Sudanese state but demanded a federal structure; otherwise, it called for independence. This position was strongly opposed by the Muslim Arab North <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

## Path to Independence and First Civil War

Matters escalated in July 1955 when southern troops serving in the colonial armed forces mutinied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. As violence spread, Britain quickly decided it could not control the situation, and six months later, on January 1, 1956, Sudan gained its independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

From the outset, the country was plunged into a bitter and brutal [[sudan_civil_war_and_humanitarian_crisis | civil war]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. This first [[sudan_civil_war_and_humanitarian_crisis | civil war]] lasted until 1972, when a peace deal granted the South considerable self-rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

## Second Civil War and Rise of Omar Al-Bashir

Hopes for a lasting settlement were short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Following the discovery of oil deposits along the North-South boundary, the Northern-led central government revoked the agreement, imposing direct rule, including Islamic law, on the southern areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. This sparked a second [[sudan_civil_war_and_humanitarian_crisis | civil war]] as the Southern-led Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), supported by neighbouring [[ethiopian_political_history_and_conflicts | Ethiopia]], seized control of much of the South <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. By the end of the 1980s, the [[sudan_civil_war_and_humanitarian_crisis | civil war]] in Sudan had become Africa's longest-running conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

In 1989, the Sudanese army staged a coup, imposing a dictatorship under Colonel Omar Al-Bashir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Despite hopes that this would turn the tide of the war, the SPLA retained control over large parts of the South <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

## Darfur Conflict and Southern Independence

By the turn of the millennium, the North was under increasing pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Aside from almost fifty years of continuous war with the South, which had resulted in 2 million deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>, a brutal new conflict emerged in the west of the country, in a region known as Darfur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Following the 9/11 attacks, Washington began to focus on Bashir, who was accused of supporting Islamist terrorism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

In January 2005, following US-led talks, Bashir agreed to a peace deal that would eventually pave the way for southern independence six years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. While the question of the South was resolved, the situation in Darfur continued to deteriorate as a violent Arab militia, the Janjaweed, waged a campaign of genocide and ethnic cleansing against sub-Saharan African groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. With Bashir facing charges of crimes against humanity, the Janjaweed were eventually placed under the control of the army, becoming known as the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

## Post-Independence Turmoil and Military Coups

Even with the apparent path to peace, other problems emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Having lost significant oil revenues when the South became independent, the government was forced to reduce spending, sparking widespread opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Following massive street protests, the military intervened, ousting Bashir in April 2019 after 30 years in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

Although there were hopes for democracy, the military attempted to retain power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. However, under considerable international pressure, they agreed to a power-sharing transitional council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. This body included armed forces commander General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and his deputy, General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, the RSF commander, alongside a civilian prime minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

Popular calls for democracy persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. Facing further protest, the military staged another coup on October 25, 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Burhan and Dagalo retook control, abolishing the transitional council and arresting the civilian prime minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

## Escalation to Current Conflict

Despite close ties dating back to the Darfur conflict, tensions soon grew between the two generals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Burhan enjoyed the support of northern elites, while Dagalo, from Darfur, was viewed with contempt and suspicion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Dagalo was also tainted by corruption allegations after seizing control of gold mines in Darfur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

Facing high-level opposition, Dagalo sought to build his power base by reinventing himself as a political figure, courting popular support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. He called the coup a mistake and accused Burhan of being a radical Islamist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Both men also sought to build international support: Burhan fostered relations with Washington and the West, while Dagalo established close ties with Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

The growing [[factions_within_sudans_military_and_power_struggles | power struggle]] between the two men erupted on April 15, 2023, when clashes broke out between the army and the RSF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. Over the following days and weeks, these escalated rapidly, leading to a surge in casualties and tens of thousands fleeing the capital, Khartoum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

## International Attention and Current State

Initially, the [[recent_fighting_in_sudan_and_potential_new_civil_war | fighting in Sudan]] attracted considerable international attention, partly due to the large number of foreigners caught in the deteriorating situation and the need for urgent evacuations by various countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. Broader [[international_implications_and_geopolitical_interests in Sudan | political and strategic factors]] were also at play, including Sudan's position on the Red Sea (a vital waterway), its role as a conduit between North and Sub-Saharan Africa, and the [[factions_within_sudans_military_and_power_struggles | factional links]] to Russia and the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

Despite initial efforts for ceasefires and peace talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>, media coverage soon diminished after foreigners were evacuated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. Policy attention also shifted, especially after the surge in Middle East violence in October 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

Although there is now little international focus on Sudan, the situation on the ground continues to worsen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. Fighting has spread beyond the capital, with the RSF making significant gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Calls for a ceasefire during Ramadan have gone unheeded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. The conflict has even become a strange proxy war involving Russian Wagner Group members fighting Ukrainian commandos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

The [[sudan_civil_war_and_humanitarian_crisis | civil war]] has resulted in at least 14,000 killed and tens of thousands wounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. The broader effects are of great concern, with Sudan now having the highest number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the world, estimated at 6.3 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Additionally, 1.7 million are believed to have fled the country as refugees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

The country stands on the brink of starvation due to severe food shortages and the breakdown of law and order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. The UN estimates that around half the country's population, approximately 25 million people, needs life-saving assistance, including 14 million children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. Attacks on Red Sea shipping by Houthi forces have further curtailed food imports to Port Sudan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>, exacerbating existing food shortages from regional famines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. Sudan is on course to become the world's worst [[humanitarian_impact_and_food_shortages_in_sudan | hunger crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>, with growing fears about worsening violence in Darfur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

The UN has called for $4.1 billion USD to address the crisis, but it has been extraordinarily difficult to get the international community to focus on Sudan, as attention remains on Gaza and Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

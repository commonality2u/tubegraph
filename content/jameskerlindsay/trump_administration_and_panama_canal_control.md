Questions are growing about whether the incoming Trump Administration plans to retake control of the Panama Canal, following a public exchange between President-elect Donald Trump and the Panamanian president in December 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This has sparked concerns about potential military invasion, escalating the "war of words" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Strategic Importance of the Panama Canal

[[geopolitical_tensions_over_strategic_waterways | Strategic waterways]] are vital in international relations, connecting major oceans or seas and shortening shipping routes, which reduces time and costs for global trade and provides crucial routes for military forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. As such, they are often a focal point of [[geopolitical_tensions_over_strategic_waterways | geopolitical tensions]] as countries vie for influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

The Panama Canal, an 82 km (51-mile) waterway in the Republic of Panama, links the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, dramatically shortening the 13,000 km (8,000-mile) route around South America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

For the United States, the canal holds unique value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. As its largest user, accounting for roughly 60% of its traffic, it is crucial for transporting agricultural products, industrial goods, and energy supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. It also provides a vital passage for the US Navy to move between the East and West Coasts, making it economically and militarily essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Historical Context: US Involvement and Control

[[us_panama_canal_history_and_strategic_importance | Panama's history]] began with indigenous peoples before Spanish explorers charted its coastline in the early 16th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. It became a critical trade route for the Spanish Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. In 1821, Panama gained independence from Spain as part of Gran Colombia, a union that later dissolved, leaving Panama under Colombian rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

### Early Canal Efforts and US Intervention
The strategic value of a Panamanian waterway was recognized long before the Suez Canal inspired serious construction efforts in Panama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. In 1881, French engineer Ferdinand de Lesseps, who built the Suez Canal, began construction, but the project was abandoned in 1889 due to engineering challenges, disease, and mismanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

The United States, keen to continue the project, faced rejection from Colombia for a proposed treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. In response, Washington supported Panamanian rebels seeking independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. On November 3, 1903, the US prevented Colombian forces from intervening as a revolt erupted, leading to Panama's declaration of independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Just weeks later, on November 18, the US government signed a treaty with the new Panamanian administration, guaranteeing its independence in return for complete control *in perpetuity* over a 10-mile (15 km) wide zone surrounding the canal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. The canal was completed ten years later, in 1914 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

### The 1977 Handover Treaty
While the canal's completion was a turning point for global trade, resentment grew among Panamanians due to significant US influence over their internal affairs and the canal zone's wealth and special privileges under US law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Protests erupted in 1964, and widespread opposition to US domination continued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

Recognizing the damage to US interests, particularly as a symbol of American imperialism during the Cold War, President Jimmy Carter opened negotiations on the canal's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. On September 7, 1977, the United States and Panama signed an agreement with two main elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>:
*   Following a period of joint administration, Panama would gain complete control of the canal on December 31, 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.
*   The canal would remain neutral territory, allowing ships from all countries, including military vessels, free use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Crucially, this was underpinned by a clause allowing the US to intervene militarily to protect the canal's neutrality if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

Many, especially conservative Republicans, opposed the agreement, viewing the transfer as a dangerous surrender of US interests over a vital asset that the US built and paid for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Fears also existed that Panama, as a small and unstable country, could not oversee the canal's security and neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. These fears seemed confirmed after the death of military leader General Omar Torrijos in 1981, when General Manuel Noriega emerged, leading Panama to become a corrupt and violent criminal state and a drug trafficking hub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. As a result, the US invaded in December 1989, overthrowing Noriega <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

With Panama under democratic control, preparations for the [[panama_canal_handover_and_international_relations | handover of the canal]] continued, and the transition was completed as planned on New Year's Eve 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

## Recent Tensions and China's Influence

Since the [[panama_canal_handover_and_international_relations | successful handover of the canal]], Panama's position as a global trade hub has steadily grown, further enhanced by a 2016 expansion project that increased the canal's capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

However, despite initially good relations with the United States, tensions have emerged over the past decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. The US has frequently expressed concerns about corruption and lack of transparency in Panama's financial dealings, notably with the "Panama Papers" scandal revealing how Panamanian entities facilitated worldwide tax evasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

Additionally, differences have arisen over the canal itself, fed by two factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>:
1.  **Increasing Transit Fees**: Citing rising maintenance costs, canal expansion expenses, and climate change issues like reduced rainfall affecting water levels, the Panamanian government has raised tolls, disproportionately affecting US shipping and leading to complaints from US businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
2.  **Geopolitical Element (China's Influence)**: Panama formally recognized the People's Republic of China in 2017, switching allegiance from the Republic of China (Taiwan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. Since then, China has invested significantly in Panama, funding and building ports and other infrastructure projects related to the canal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. This has fueled US concern about China's rise and specific worries that Beijing may exert too much control over Panama and the strategically vital waterway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

## Trump's Statements and Panamanian Response

Against this backdrop, President-elect Donald Trump posted a lengthy message on his Truth Central social media platform on December 21, 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. He emphasized the canal's vital importance to the United States and the economic and human costs of its construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

Trump insisted that Panama should administer the canal solely by itself and not rely on others like China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. He condemned the fees faced by US shipping, calling for the "ripoff" to stop immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

Panama's president, Jose R. Molino, quickly responded to Trump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. He insisted that "every square meter of the Panama Canal and its adjacent zone belongs to Panama and will remain so" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.
> "The sovereignty and independence of our country are not negotiable." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>

Unwilling to let the matter rest, Trump shot back with another post saying, "We'll see about that," followed by an image of a US flag flying over water with the caption "Welcome to the United States Canal!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

## Implications and Future Outlook

The aggressive tone of Trump's posts immediately raised worries about potential military action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. However, observers note that Trump has generally shied away from military engagements, and his campaign focused on avoiding overseas conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. Nonetheless, as an issue directly affecting US economic and commercial interests—an area Trump focuses on closely—this could be seen differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

Any aggressive moves to reclaim control of the canal would likely face significant international opposition and violate international law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. The 1977 treaty does not allow for unilateral military action to reclaim control of the Canal Zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

Observers suggest that the incoming administration has several other avenues to address its concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>:
*   **Diplomatic Negotiations**: Discussing fees and limiting external influence over the canal, though already soured relations make this difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
*   **Judicial Solution**: Considering arbitration or mediation by a third party, as Article 14 of the 1977 treaty explicitly allows for such options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
*   **Economic Measures**: Introducing sanctions or offering Panama economic incentives to influence its policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

Whether any of these measures would be pursued, or if Trump intends to escalate further, remains to be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. This "odd and somewhat surprising spat" over an issue many thought resolved has become another significant question regarding the effects of a second Trump term on global politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

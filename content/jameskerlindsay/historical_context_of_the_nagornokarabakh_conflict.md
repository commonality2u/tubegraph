On September 19, 2023, [[Azerbaijan and Armenian conflict in NagornoKarabakh | Azerbaijan]] launched a significant new attack on the Armenian-inhabited breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The territory surrendered by the next day, despite fears of a bitter war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Subsequently, tens of thousands of ethnic Armenians began to leave the area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. While [[Armenias response and perspective on the conflict | Armenia]] referred to this as [[ethnic_cleansing_accusations_in_nagornokarabakh | ethnic cleansing]], Azerbaijan maintained that people were leaving voluntarily and not under duress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Defining Ethnic Cleansing

The terms "genocide" and "ethnic cleansing" were not known a century ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. While genocide is clearly defined by the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide – as acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial, or religious group – there is no specific convention defining ethnic cleansing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

The term "ethnic cleansing" emerged in the 1990s during the wars in former Yugoslavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. The most widely accepted definition was laid down in 1992 by a UN commission of experts, which defined it as:
> "rendering an area ethnically homogeneous by using force or intimidation to remove persons or given groups from the area" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

This can involve various methods, including:
*   Murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>
*   Torture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>
*   Sexual assaults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>
*   Severe injury to civilians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>
*   Confinement of civilian populations in ghetto areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>
*   Forcible displacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>
*   Deliberate military attacks or threats of attacks on civilians and civilian areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>
*   Destruction of property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>

The precise determination of ethnic cleansing in any given situation is not always straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

## Roots of the Conflict

The [[Armenia and Azerbaijan conflict | conflict]] in Nagorno-Karabakh has a long and complex history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. The region, located in the South Caucasus, has been traditionally inhabited predominantly by ethnic Armenians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

Following the incorporation of the Caucasus into the Soviet Union and the creation of the Armenian and Azerbaijani Soviet Socialist Republics in the early 1920s, Nagorno-Karabakh was granted autonomy within Azerbaijan as the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

### Post-Soviet Wars and Displacements

This arrangement persisted until the collapse of the Soviet Union, at which point Nagorno-Karabakh sought to break away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. After declaring independence and with support from Armenia, it fought and won a three-year war against Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. This conflict resulted in Armenian forces securing control over Nagorno-Karabakh and overrunning surrounding Azerbaijani districts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This led to the displacement of up to a million ethnic Azeris, an act that Azerbaijan has long described as ethnic cleansing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

Although the UN Security Council recognized Azerbaijan's sovereignty over Nagorno-Karabakh during the war, subsequent years saw the international community attempt to negotiate a settlement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Despite numerous rounds of talks, no final agreement was reached, and the region became known for extreme hostility between the sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

### Escalation and the [[NagornoKarabakh war of 2020]]

By the late 2000s, Azerbaijan, increasingly wealthy from Caspian oil and gas exports, began to build up its armed forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Many feared this was a policy aimed at retaking control by force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. After growing incidents, including a brief four-day conflict in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>, a new war erupted in September 2020 when Azerbaijan launched a full-scale attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Azerbaijani forces seized back occupied districts and moved into Nagorno-Karabakh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

Just as Azerbaijan seemed poised to overrun Nagorno-Karabakh, [[role_of_russia_in_the_nagornokarabakh_peace_process | Russia]] brokered a ceasefire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. The [[nagornokarabakh_peace_agreement | agreement]] included a humanitarian corridor between Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh, overseen by Russian peacekeepers, and Armenia's agreement to open talks on providing Azerbaijan overland access to its exclave of Nakhchivan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

### Post-2020 Peace Efforts and Blockade

Following the 2020 agreement, the European Union took the lead in efforts to negotiate a final [[nagornokarabakh_peace_agreement | peace agreement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Armenia, having accepted Azerbaijan's sovereignty over the area, sought some form of autonomy for Nagorno-Karabakh's inhabitants, possibly including future status talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. However, Azerbaijan steadfastly refused any special status or self-rule for the Armenian community, with President Ilham Aliyev insisting they would have the same rights as any other Azerbaijani citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

Tensions escalated again, leading to fighting along the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. In late 2022, Baku imposed a blockade on Nagorno-Karabakh, restricting access to food, electricity, and humanitarian aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. This led to a significant deterioration of living conditions, which many viewed as an attempt to starve Nagorno-Karabakh into submission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

### The 2023 Assault and Mass Exodus

Fears grew that Azerbaijan was preparing to relaunch a military operation for a decisive victory over Nagorno-Karabakh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Despite pleas for restraint from the European Union and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>, the renewed assault began on September 19, 2023, with heavy bombardment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. While Azerbaijan claimed it was responding to terrorist provocations, its actions drew widespread international condemnation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Many Western governments criticized the use of force but affirmed Azerbaijan's sovereignty over Nagorno-Karabakh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

[[Armenias response and perspective on the conflict | Armenia]] strongly condemned the attack, but Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan clarified that Armenia would not intervene, recognizing that it was outgunned and any attempt would lead to a wider war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

The assault was swift, with the Armenian leadership in Nagorno-Karabakh surrendering within 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Following the surrender, tens of thousands of ethnic Armenians began to flee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Within a week, an estimated 50,000 of the territory's 120,000 inhabitants had reached Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. This mass exodus led to accusations from the Armenian prime minister that Azerbaijan was carrying out [[ethnic_cleansing_accusations_in_nagornokarabakh | ethnic cleansing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

## Conflicting Perspectives on the Exodus

Azerbaijan's government has strongly denied claims of [[ethnic_cleansing_accusations_in_nagornokarabakh | ethnic cleansing]], insisting that troops have not forced people to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Baku maintains that Armenians are leaving voluntarily after their defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. They also assert that Armenians are not in danger, broadcasting messages of welcome and showing police handing out water to those leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. However, an Azerbaijani police force arrested a former senior Nagorno-Karabakh leader as he attempted to flee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

Critics argue that the blockade and the subsequent military attack, aimed at retaking civilian areas, demonstrate a broader policy of ethnic cleansing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. Given the long history of conflict, the dehumanizing language used by some Azerbaijani leaders, and reports of atrocities, many Armenians feel they have no choice but to leave due to the perceived danger of retribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

The two sides hold significantly different views on whether the current situation constitutes ethnic cleansing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. [[Armenia]] contends that Azerbaijan's actions, including pursuing a violent settlement, made the mass exodus inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

## [[Future of Armenia and NagornoKarabakh | Future Outlook]]

The conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh's status is now considered over, with Azerbaijan having secured a decisive victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. The Republic of Artsakh, as the area was known to Armenians, no longer exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. While hopes for independence or joining Armenia are gone, questions remain about the future of the Armenian population in Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. The critical question is whether any Armenians will stay or return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

Although the Azerbaijani government has stated Armenians are welcome to remain and return, skeptics view this as an attempt to quell international criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. Many suspect that few Armenians will return, especially given Baku's refusal to outline steps for meaningful self-rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

On January 1, 2024, a landmark agreement was signed between Ethiopia and Somaliland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This deal, offering landlocked Ethiopia access to the strategically vital Red Sea, appears to include a readiness by Ethiopia to recognise Somaliland as an independent country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This development has been met with jubilation in Somaliland, which has been internationally shunned since declaring independence from Somalia 30 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The agreement is seen as a crucial step towards full acceptance on the world stage, potentially leading to UN membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. However, questions remain about whether this is truly the breakthrough [[Somalilands quest for international recognition | Somaliland has yearned for]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## The Significance of State Recognition

State recognition is fundamental to modern international relations, signifying countries' acceptance of one another as nominal equals within the community of sovereign nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. While legal scholars might argue a state can exist without recognition, formal acceptance is crucial for practical reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>:
*   It facilitates diplomatic relations, trade, security, and cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   It bolsters international legitimacy, enabling participation in global and regional organisations like the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   It is vital for a country's security, helping to safeguard borders by establishing internationally accepted boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

As a result, breakaway territories and de facto states worldwide, including Somaliland, actively pursue international recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

### Somaliland's History and Quest for Recognition

Somaliland, located in the Horn of Africa, encompasses approximately 180,000 square kilometers, which would make it the 89th largest member of the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Its modern [[History of Somalilands independence and secession | history of independence]] can be traced back to European imperial expansion in the late 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. British Somaliland gained independence on June 25, 1960, but quickly merged with newly independent Italian Somaliland five days later to form the Somali Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. Although initially welcomed, tensions soon emerged due to differing histories and clan affiliations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

After the overthrow of Somalia's military dictatorship in January 1991, and as the South descended into anarchy, the North seized the opportunity to reclaim its independence, proclaiming the Republic of Somaliland on May 18, 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. In the subsequent years, Somaliland consolidated its statehood, establishing effective state structures and democratic institutions, becoming an "oasis of peace and security" while Somalia was embroiled in civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

Despite these efforts and arguments for acceptance based on its stability and prior independence, [[Somaliland struggle for international recognition | Somaliland's efforts to gain full recognition]] from other states have been unsuccessful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. No country has been willing to be the first to break ranks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. In 2005, an African Union fact-finding mission even recommended recognition, noting Somaliland's "unique and self-justified" situation in African political history and stating it should not be linked to "opening a Pandora's Box" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. However, Western countries expected the initial step to come from the African Union or a group of African states, but no consensus emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

## The Ethiopia-Somaliland Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)

On January 1, 2024, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between Ethiopia and Somaliland in Addis Ababa, overseen by Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. While the exact terms of this legally non-binding statement of intent have not been revealed, it is understood that Ethiopia will gain a long-term lease over a Red Sea port facility for commercial and military naval use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. In return, Somaliland President Musa Bihi Abdi stated that Ethiopia recognises Somaliland under the deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

### Is it True Recognition?

Despite the jubilation in Somaliland, there is confusion about the legal and political meaning of the agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
*   **Intent**: Under international law, recognition fundamentally requires intent; a state cannot accidentally recognise another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. In contested cases, a clear statement of recognition is expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   **Ethiopian Stance**: So far, there is little sign that Addis Ababa has formally recognised Somaliland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. The Ethiopian statement about the agreement did not mention recognition and avoided using the term 'Republic of Somaliland' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Likewise, Somaliland's full title was not used during the signing ceremony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

>[!INFO] A Crucial Step, Not Yet Recognition
>For these reasons, while the MoU is a crucial step, it does not amount to recognition at this stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. However, the Ethiopian statement does lay foundations for possible future recognition, notably by highlighting Somaliland's independence prior to its union with Italian Somaliland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

## Challenges to Somaliland's UN Membership Prospects

Even if Ethiopia were to proceed with full recognition, significant challenges remain for Somaliland's broader [[Somalilands struggle for international recognition | international recognition]] and potential UN membership.

### 1. Uncertainty of Ethiopian Recognition

*   **Ethiopia's Motivations**: Ethiopia desperately seeks Red Sea access, a desire highlighted by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed in late 2023, which even led to fears of a potential war against Eritrea to regain maritime access lost in 1993 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
*   **Damaged Relations with Somalia**: Recognition would severely damage relations with neighbouring Somalia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Mogadishu has denounced the MoU, passed a law declaring it null and void, and insisted on preserving its territorial integrity, even considering military options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
*   **Somaliland's Internal Position**: Somaliland's position is not as strong as it once was, especially following recent fighting in the disputed eastern area of Las Anod <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.
*   **Internal Opposition in Somaliland**: Despite jubilation, some Somalilanders are concerned about the presence of Ethiopian troops, with the defence minister even resigning over the MoU, arguing Ethiopia remains the country's "number one enemy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.
*   **Ethiopia Potentially Backing Off**: Given the pressure, Ethiopia may yet back off from full recognition, opting instead for financial and security incentives to keep the port deal intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

### 2. Broader International Acceptance

Even if Ethiopia proceeds, it is uncertain if other African states will follow its lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
*   **Transactional Nature**: The fact that any recognition would be tied to the port deal may undermine the [[Somalilands struggle for international recognition | Somaliland cause]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. Many countries might view it as a transactional move rather than a principled step, deterring them from following suit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.
*   **Somalia's Opposition**: Somalia's strong opposition will undoubtedly seek to persuade others that any Ethiopian recognition serves only Ethiopian self-interest and would destabilise African borders more broadly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.
*   **Precedent for Borders**: Despite Somaliland's justifications, countries often stick together to avoid setting dangerous new precedents, especially in Africa with its "patchwork of colonial borders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. Many are nervous about challenging the sanctity of state boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.
*   **Shifting International Support**: Crucially, there are signs that international actors are stepping back from the possibility of recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.
    *   The United States, despite earlier signals, has stated its full support for Somalia's territorial integrity within its 1960 borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.
    *   Significant regional actors, including Egypt and Turkey, have aligned behind Somalia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. These nations possess diplomatic clout and could support Mogadishu if conflict emerges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.

>[!WARNING] Outlook for UN Membership
>For all these reasons, while the MoU is a significant step forward for Somaliland, Ethiopian recognition is far from guaranteed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. Even if it occurs, it may do little to advance Somaliland's recognition on the world stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. After decades of seeking international acceptance, the deal with Ethiopia might prove to be a less significant breakthrough than Somaliland had hoped for, making its path to UN membership highly challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.

In December 2023, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan paid a high-profile [[erdogans_visit_to_greece | visit to neighboring Greece]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. After years of tensions, this trip was hailed as a pivotal moment in bilateral relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. While it improved the general mood between Athens and Ankara, questions remain about its lasting impact or ability to settle outstanding disputes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

Relations between Greece and Turkey often present a complex picture, fluctuating between periods of good ties, tensions, and even outright hostility in a cyclical pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This dynamic relationship is deeply shaped by [[historical_tensions_between_greece_and_turkey | history]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Historical Foundations

The story of Greece and Turkey's intertwined history begins with the division of the Roman Empire in 395 AD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The predominantly Greek-speaking and Orthodox Christian Eastern half, known as the Byzantine Empire, steadily lost territory after the emergence of Islam in the 7th Century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. This accelerated with the Seljuk Turks, who became the dominant force in the Muslim world after migrating from Central Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Their victory at Manzikert in 1071 paved the way for the eventual conquest of Anatolia by various Turkic tribes, including the Ottoman Turks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. In 1453, the Ottomans overran the Byzantine imperial capital, Constantinople <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

Greeks lived under Ottoman Turkish rule for three and a half centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. However, by the early 19th century, Greek national consciousness grew, leading to a revolt against Ottoman control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. An independent Greek Kingdom emerged in 1830, initially centered on the Peloponnese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. The new state sought to unite all Greeks in the Eastern Mediterranean, gradually expanding its territory over the following decades to include Central Greece, the Ionian Islands, Crete, and Macedonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

At the end of the First World War, with the Ottoman Empire defeated, Greece attempted to claim Anatolia by invading Asia Minor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. However, Turkish nationalist forces mobilized, and the Greek army was defeated in October 1922 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

### Treaty of Lausanne

On July 24, 1924, Greece and the new Republic of Turkey signed the Treaty of Lausanne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. This treaty established their modern borders and required the demilitarization of certain islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. It also mandated a population exchange, relocating almost all Orthodox Christians in Turkey and Muslims in Greece, with exceptions for communities in Istanbul and Thrace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

## Cycles of Rapprochement and Confrontation

### Early 20th Century Rapprochement

Under the leadership of Greek Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos and Turkish President Mustafa Kamal Atatürk, relations quickly improved in the decade following the Treaty of Lausanne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. They signed numerous bilateral agreements, including a Treaty of Friendship, Neutrality, Conciliation, and Arbitration in 1930, and a Cordial Friendship Pact in 1933 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. By 1934, they had formed a joint defense alliance with Romania and Yugoslavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

### World War II Strain and Cold War Alliance

Despite earlier progress, ties were strained during World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Although Greece was occupied by Axis powers, Turkey remained neutral until the final days of the war and imposed a punitive tax that heavily affected the Greek community in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Nevertheless, relations soon recovered, and in 1952, both countries joined [[turkeys_relationship_with_nato_and_the_eu | NATO]] as the Cold War intensified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

### The Cyprus Dispute

The period of good relations ended in the mid-1950s due to the issue of Cyprus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Administered by Britain since 1878 and formally ceded to them by the Treaty of Lausanne, the island saw a Greek Cypriot armed campaign for union with Greece (Enosis) launched in April 1955 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This led to tensions as Turkish Cypriots, who constituted a fifth of the population, called for the island's partition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Anti-Greek rioting erupted in Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

To prevent a civil war and undermine NATO's critical flank, Athens and Ankara reached a compromise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. In August 1960, Cyprus became an independent republic with a power-sharing agreement guaranteed by Britain, Greece, and Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

Despite initial hopes for improved relations, constitutional arrangements in Cyprus broke down in December 1963, leading to fighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. The breaking point came in July 1974 when the Greek military junta overthrew the Cypriot president to secure unification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. Citing its right to protect the constitutional order, Turkey invaded on July 20, seizing control of a third of the island, a division that remains a fundamental point of contention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

### Aegean Disputes

Concurrent to the Cyprus issue, other tensions emerged, particularly following the discovery of oil in the Aegean Sea in the early 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Turkey argued that the continental shelf was an extension of the Anatolian Peninsula, while Greece claimed it belonged to the Greek islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. The International Court of Justice ruled it had no jurisdiction without Turkey's agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

Further disputes arose over:
*   **Territorial Waters and Airspace**: The Treaty of Lausanne permitted Greece three nautical miles, extended to six in 1936 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. However, the 1983 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea allowed for an extension to 12 miles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Turkey's parliament passed a resolution making any Greek extension a justification for war, arguing it would make the Aegean a Greek lake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   **Air Traffic Control**: Rows also broke out over air traffic control in the Aegean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
*   **Militarization of Islands**: Disputes regarding the militarization of certain islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   **Minority Rights**: Issues concerning minority rights in Thrace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

In March 1987, a significant crisis erupted when Turkey began oil exploration in the Aegean, narrowly averting armed conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. A subsequent meeting at the World Economic Forum in Davos in 1988 aimed to improve relations but ultimately led nowhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

New problems emerged, including the "Grey Zones" issue in 1996, sparked when a Turkish ship ran aground on an uninhabited islet in the Aegean, leading to a dispute over sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. Another crisis in 1999 was triggered by the arrest of the PKK leader, Abdullah Öcalan, as he left the Greek Embassy in Kenya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. This was viewed by Ankara as a fundamental betrayal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

### Earthquake Diplomacy and EU Aspirations

Despite coming close to conflict in 1999, everything changed a few months later when both Greece and Turkey were hit by major earthquakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. This event sparked a dramatic new period of rapprochement, including Greece's momentous decision to lift its long-standing veto on [[turkeys_relationship_with_european_union_and_membership_aspirations | Turkey's candidacy for European Union membership]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

Bilateral relations improved significantly, leading to numerous agreements, increased intergovernmental cooperation, and exploratory talks on the continental shelf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. Broader cultural links, tourism, and trade also flourished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

The emergence of Recep Tayyip Erdogan as Turkey's leader in late 2002 further improved relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. Stressing his commitment to Turkey's [[turkeys_relationship_with_european_union_and_membership_aspirations | EU membership]], he prioritized relations with Greece and solving Cyprus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. While a reunification effort for Cyprus failed in 2004, Turkey began [[turkeys_relationship_with_european_union_and_membership_aspirations | EU membership]] talks in 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

### Renewed Deterioration

The optimistic mood began to wane by the end of the 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. Although a High-Level Cooperation Council was created in 2009, outstanding issues remained unresolved, particularly concerning the Aegean continental shelf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. Meanwhile, Erdogan became increasingly authoritarian and estranged from the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. As [[turkeys_relationship_with_european_union_and_membership_aspirations | Turkey-EU negotiations stalled]], relations with Greece deteriorated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.

This was highlighted in 2015 when Ankara allowed over a million migrants to cross the Aegean in small boats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. Matters continued to worsen:
*   **2017 Erdogan Visit**: Erdogan's visit to Greece in 2017, the first Turkish presidential visit in 65 years, was a disaster when he called for the Treaty of Lausanne to be modernized, a suggestion immediately rejected by the Greek president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.
*   **Cyprus Two-State Solution**: Another attempt to resolve the Cyprus issue failed that summer, leading Ankara to advocate for a two-state solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.
*   **Mediterranean Claims**: Relations were further undermined by Turkey's increasingly vocal territorial claims in the wider Mediterranean, fueled by growing energy finds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Ankara signed a maritime agreement with Libya covering an area claimed by Greece and launched oil exploration near Greek islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.
*   **Aegean Incursions**: Throughout 2022, there was a sharp increase in incursions by Turkish military aircraft over the Aegean islands, a traditional indicator of broader tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.

### Recent Rapprochement (2023)

As Greece and Turkey marked the centenary of the Treaty of Lausanne in 2023, circumstances appeared to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. Once again, a devastating earthquake in Turkey drove rapprochement, with Greece quickly sending emergency rescue teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. At the same time, having won re-election and facing growing economic problems at home, Erdogan seemed to decide to mend relations with Western partners, including Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. This aligns with [[the_impact_of_geopolitical_events_on_turkeys_diplomacy | the impact of geopolitical events on Turkey's diplomacy]].

It was against this backdrop that his brief [[erdogans_visit_to_greece | visit to Greece]] on December 7 was hailed as a new start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. Erdogan called for the Aegean to become a "sea of peace" and stated that no problem was unsolvable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. He and Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis signed 15 bilateral agreements covering areas from energy to agriculture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. They also agreed on a non-binding 10-point declaration of friendly relations, which included commitments to:
*   Political dialogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>
*   Confidence-building measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>
*   A joint action plan for cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>
*   A commitment to resolve disputes amicably through direct consultations or other UN Charter means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>

## Conclusion

Despite these welcome developments, there is a sense of deja vu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>. Greece and Turkey have been in similar situations many times before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. Without settling outstanding bilateral issues, including Cyprus, any new attempt at a fresh start, while welcome, is likely to last only until the next crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. This pattern suggests that the recent rapprochement may simply be the latest in a long cycle of ups and downs between these two Mediterranean neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

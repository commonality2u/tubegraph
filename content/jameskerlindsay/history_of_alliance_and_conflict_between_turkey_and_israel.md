Once close allies, [[turkey_and_israel_diplomatic_relations | tensions have steadily risen]] between Turkey and Israel over the past two decades, now seemingly close to a boiling point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Amid growing tensions in Syria, there is a real threat of confrontation between their forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Historical Context and Early Alliance
Both Turkey and Israel are relatively modern states, founded in 1923 and 1948 respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:39">[02:05:39]</a>. However, their relationship dates back centuries to the Ottoman Empire, which ruled parts of the Middle East, including present-day Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:03">[02:16:03]</a>. The Ottoman Empire historically provided sanctuary for Jews fleeing persecution in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:04">[02:21:04]</a>.

After the Second World War and the establishment of the state of Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:14">[02:27:14]</a>, Turkey became the very first Muslim-majority country to recognize Israel on March 28, 1949, establishing [[turkey_and_israel_diplomatic_relations | diplomatic relations]] shortly thereafter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:17">[02:44:17]</a>. This decision was partly based on a shared geostrategic outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:06">[02:56:06]</a>. During the Cold War, both countries aligned firmly with the Western camp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:07">[03:00:07]</a> and shared a similar ideological worldview, founded on secular nationalist traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:06">[03:06:06]</a>.

Over the following decades, the relationship evolved steadily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:33">[03:15:33]</a>. While Turkey generally kept a distant relationship with much of the Arab world, focusing on Europe and the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:30">[03:21:30]</a>, Ankara was cautious not to strain ties with the wider Middle East by appearing too close to Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:12">[03:28:12]</a>. Domestic political concerns also existed, as close ties could cause resentment among more religious parts of Turkish society who strongly favored the [[history_of_the_israelpalestinian_conflict | Palestinian cause]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:09">[03:38:09]</a>.

## "Golden Age" of Turkish-Israeli Relations
The peak of Turkish-Israel relations occurred in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:09">[04:00:09]</a>. With the end of the Cold War and initial steps towards [[history_of_the_israelpalestinian_conflict | peace between Israelis and Palestinians]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:07">[04:05:07]</a>, cooperation between Turkey and Israel dramatically increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:04">[04:10:04]</a>. In 1991, [[turkey_and_israel_diplomatic_relations | diplomatic relations]] were strengthened, leading to a free trade agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:11">[04:16:11]</a>. The relationship particularly thrived in military and security engagement, with growing defense industry cooperation and high-profile training agreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:22">[04:25:22]</a>.

## Deterioration Under the AKP
The turning point came in November 2002, when the Justice and Development Party (AKP), led by Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, won national elections in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:07">[04:45:07]</a>. Although the AKP initially committed to staying close to the West and pursuing EU membership, Turkish foreign policy began to pivot towards the Arab Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:21">[04:58:21]</a>.

Initially, this shift was handled carefully to avoid alienating Israel, with Ankara attempting to act as an honest broker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:13">[05:11:13]</a>. However, as the decade progressed, cracks emerged as the Turkish government grew increasingly critical of [[history_of_the_israelpalestinian_conflict | Israeli policies towards the Palestinians]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:08">[05:23:08]</a>. This became internationally prominent during a heated exchange between Erdoğan and then-Israeli President Shimon Peres at the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:02">[05:32:02]</a>.

The most critical incident occurred in May 2010 when a convoy of Turkish ships attempted to deliver aid to Gaza, which was under Israeli blockade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:04">[05:47:04]</a>. Despite being in international waters, the lead vessel was raided by Israeli commandos, resulting in nine deaths and over 30 injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:04">[05:55:04]</a>. In response, Turkey withdrew its ambassador to Israel, leaving the once-strong relationship in tatters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:03">[06:03:03]</a>. Erdoğan subsequently became an increasingly vocal critic of Israel on the international stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:03">[06:11:03]</a>.

## Attempts at Reconciliation and Renewed Collapse
In March 2013, President Obama facilitated a phone call between Erdoğan and Benjamin Netanyahu, leading to an Israeli apology and an agreement to restore [[turkey_and_israel_diplomatic_relations | diplomatic relations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:13">[06:28:13]</a>. Three years later, the Israeli government agreed to pay $20 million in compensation to the families of those killed in the raid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:09">[06:41:09]</a>. However, this progress was short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:07">[06:50:07]</a>. In May 2018, relations plummeted again after heavy fighting in Gaza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:03">[06:55:03]</a>.

A new effort to rebuild relations began in January 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:04">[07:01:04]</a>, leading to the first direct phone call between the Turkish and Israeli foreign ministers in 13 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:14">[07:08:14]</a>. Weeks later, Erdoğan welcomed the Israeli president to Ankara, a significant breakthrough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:02">[07:14:02]</a>. The leaders discussed expanding trade and energy cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:07">[07:26:07]</a>. Yet again, this thaw was brief, collapsing 18 months later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:14">[07:33:14]</a>.

The most recent deterioration was spurred by Hamas's attack on Israel on October 7, 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:08">[07:43:08]</a>. As Israel retaliated with a full-scale military campaign in Gaza, Erdoğan became increasingly outspoken, accusing Israeli leaders of committing war crimes and genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:03">[07:51:03]</a>. This culminated in Turkey severing [[turkey_and_israel_diplomatic_relations | diplomatic ties]] with Israel in November 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:11">[08:04:11]</a>.

## Current Tensions and the Syrian Factor
A critical development following the Gaza events was the overthrow of the 50-year Assad regime in Syria by the Islamist HTS militia and its Turkish-backed allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:06">[08:14:06]</a>. This has led to [[turkeys_role_in_syria_and_its_effects_on_relations_with_israel | Turkey's emergence as a key international actor in Syria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:20">[08:24:20]</a>. Turkey maintains a military presence in northern Syria, viewing the de facto autonomous Syrian Kurdish region as a threat to peace and security in adjoining Kurdish areas of southeast Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:07">[08:31:07]</a>.

Israel views Turkey's expanding role in Syria as a substantial security threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:01">[08:50:01]</a>. On April 2, Israel carried out airstrikes against several Syrian military installations, including two air bases that Ankara was reportedly considering for its forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:07">[08:56:07]</a>. Israel explicitly stated that these attacks were directed at Turkey, accusing Ankara of playing a negative role in Syria and attempting to make the country a Turkish protectorate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:07">[09:07:07]</a>. The Israeli defense minister warned the new Damascus government of severe consequences if it allowed hostile forces to be stationed in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:07">[09:19:07]</a>.

## Outlook on Potential Conflict
Given their recent poor relations and Israel's clear stance on Turkish encroachment in Syria, Turkey and Israel appear to be on a dangerous collision course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:46">[09:30:46]</a>.

> [09:49:21] For a start, as dangerous as any confrontation is, there's every chance that it will be limited to Syria. Neither state will want to escalate it into a conflict on their national territories.
> [10:01:03] And while there could well be armed confrontations between Turkish and Israeli forces in Syria, the two countries may also focus on using local proxies and even cyber attacks to fight one another more indirectly.

Efforts are being made to avoid unwanted escalation. [[azerbaijans_relationship_with_israel | Azerbaijan]] has hosted talks between Turkish and Israeli officials to establish a deconfliction mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:06">[10:15:06]</a>. Although the Turkish foreign minister insists these are technical talks limited to operational coordination and not a broader normalization of ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:04">[10:33:04]</a>, this is seen as a welcome sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:03">[10:44:03]</a>.

Despite these measures, complacency is unwarranted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:09">[10:51:09]</a>. Even a conflict limited to Syria could have enormous broader international implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:07">[10:57:07]</a>. Such a confrontation, especially if fought with local proxies, could plunge Syria back into chaos, drawing in other regional actors and potentially reigniting the civil war into a more deadly phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:01">[11:05:01]</a>. Given that both Israel and Turkey are significant regional military powers, the [[potential_conflict_and_escalation_between_turkey_and_israel | potential for a disastrous escalation]] is evident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:15">[11:22:15]</a>. Many observers also question the United States' capability to manage such a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:13">[11:36:13]</a>. These growing tensions between former allies are thus viewed with deep concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:15">[11:49:15]</a>.

The [[ethiopian_civil_war_in_tigray | brutal war between Ethiopia and its northern province of Tigray]] was considered the world's most deadly conflict, largely ignored by the international community due to attention on Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Over two years, the conflict saw dramatic shifts in control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. A last-minute peace agreement was reached as Ethiopia and its allies were poised for a final military victory, which many predicted could lead to a bloodbath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

On November 2, 2022, news from South Africa confirmed that representatives of the Ethiopian federal government and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) had reached a monumental peace agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. After 10 days of intensive negotiations, organized by the African Union and chaired by the former president of Nigeria, the two sides agreed to "permanently silence the guns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This development came at a crucial moment, as the fighting in northern Ethiopia had cost up to half a million lives and displaced over 3 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. The federal Ethiopian government, supported by forces from neighboring Eritrea, had gained the upper hand and was preparing for a final onslaught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Most observers had held out little hope for success, given the deep hatred between the sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Background of Ethiopia and Tigray

The [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia]], located in East Africa, is the 26th largest member of the United Nations, covering 1.1 million square kilometers (430,000 square miles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. With a population of around 120 million, it is the second most populous country in Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Its population comprises almost a hundred different groups, with the Oromo (around a third) and Amhara (around a quarter) being the largest, followed by Somalis and Tigrayans (around six percent each) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Ethiopia is divided into nine autonomous regional states, broadly aligned with its main ethnic groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Tigray is the country's northernmost region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

Historically known as Abyssinia, Ethiopia never formally became a European colony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. In 1945, it became one of just four African founding members of the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. The modern conflict's roots trace back to the 1960s when northern Ethiopia descended into conflict as Eritrea, granted to Ethiopia by the UN in 1952, began its war for independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

After the overthrow of Emperor Haile Selassie by a Marxist military coup in 1974, the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF) allied with other ethno-national rebel groups, most notably the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), to fight the Soviet-supported regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. In May 1991, as the Cold War ended, these forces seized Addis Ababa, overthrowing the military government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. This led to Eritrea's independence and Ethiopia's reorganization as a democratic federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

Despite its multi-ethnic character, Ethiopia quickly came to be dominated by Tigrayans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Internally, it became a one-party state under the TPLF-dominated Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Meanwhile, a falling out between the TPLF and EPLF over the border in Tigray led to a bitter two-year [[ethiopian_eritrean_relations_and_history | Ethiopia-Eritrea war]], which may have caused up to 300,000 deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

## Escalation to War

Everything changed in 2018 when Abiy Ahmed Ali, an ethnic Oromo, became the leader of the EPRDF following major protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. He immediately began dismantling Tigrayan power, dissolving the EPRDF in 2019 and forming the ethnically unified Prosperity Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. The TPLF refused to join, accusing him of increasing authoritarianism and centralizing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Tensions also rose when Abiy Ahmed signed a landmark border agreement with Eritrea, for which he won the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

The final countdown to war began in March 2020. Ethiopia's electoral commission postponed general elections due to Covid-19, but the TPLF refused to accept the decision, seeing it as a power grab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. It proceeded to hold its own vote in Tigray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. By October, Ethiopia was in political crisis, with federal and Tigrayan governments no longer recognizing each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. Tigray withdrew from national institutions and refused the appointment of a new commander for the Ethiopian National Defense Forces in the region, leading the federal government to cut funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

The final spark was an attack on a federal military barracks in Tigray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. On November 4, 2020, Abiy Ahmed accused the TPLF of stealing weapons, imposed a six-month state of emergency, and ordered the national army to reassert control over Tigray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

## The War's Progression

Concerns about the situation were deep from the start. Unlike other insurgencies, the TPLF possessed significant weapons, manpower, and highly capable military commanders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Abiy Ahmed intended to win the conflict by armed force, rejecting mediation offers from African figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Initially, his plan appeared to succeed, with federal forces seizing Mekele, the Tigrayan capital, and installing a new administration within a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

However, jubilation was premature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. The TPLF regrouped in rural areas, and reports of atrocities across Tigray emerged despite communication blackouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. It was credibly alleged that Abiy Ahmed enlisted Eritrea's support to destroy the TPLF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. Additionally, the neighboring [[ethiopian_government_and_amhara_militia_conflict | federal state of Amhara]], with a long-standing boundary dispute with Tigray, joined the fight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

By early 2021, the situation in Tigray was desperate, with food and medical supplies running short and communications cut off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. International concern grew over the Ethiopian government's tactics, with some observers calling the siege "a weapon of war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. A regional envoy even reported a federal official saying Ethiopia intended to "wipe out" the Tigrayans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

Events dramatically changed when the Tigrayan Defense Force (TDF), led by senior generals including a former Ethiopian army commander, launched a major counter-offensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. By July 2021, the TDF had retaken Mekele and much of Tigray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. The TPLF then laid down its demands for peace talks: full withdrawal of Ethiopian and Eritrean troops from Tigray, complete lifting of the siege, and recognition of the TPLF as Tigray's legitimate government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. As federal troops retreated, Tigrayan forces pushed south through Amhara towards Addis Ababa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. By late summer, some suggested Ethiopia faced a repeat of 1991, when the TPLF marched into the capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

However, the war took another unexpected turn as Ethiopia acquired combat drones from Turkey, Iran, and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. The effects of these new weapons were "stunning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Tigrayan forces, having reached within 120 kilometers of the capital, were pushed back by early 2022, and Tigray was again under siege <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. Tedros Ghebreyesus, head of the World Health Organization and a Tigrayan, called it the "world's worst health crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

After 16 months, international pressure for talks grew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. On March 24, 2022, the Ethiopian government announced a unilateral humanitarian ceasefire, which the TPLF soon agreed to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. While the African Union led public settlement efforts, the United States convened its own secret talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. However, no agreement was reached, and the ceasefire collapsed in August 2022 after five months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. This led to some of the most intense fighting, as Ethiopia and its allies made a final push for victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. With reports of a full Eritrean national mobilization and major Tigrayan towns falling to federal forces, the UN Secretary-General warned the situation was "spiralling out of control" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

## The Peace Agreement

At this critical point, the African Union announced surprise talks in South Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. Despite widespread skepticism, news emerged on November 2 that the sides had reached an agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

The [[implications_of_the_peace_agreement_for_ethiopia_and_tigray | peace agreement]] is built around four key points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>:
1.  **Territorial Integrity**: It confirms Ethiopia's territorial integrity, meaning Tigray will remain part of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.
2.  **Single National Defense Force**: Ethiopia will have a single National Defense Force, and the TDF will be disarmed and disbanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.
3.  **Constitutional Order in Tigray**: The constitutional order will be re-established in Tigray, likely meaning new elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. The TPLF, as a party to the agreement, appears to be allowed to remain a political force, which would be their significant gain from the deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
4.  **Humanitarian Aid and Reconstruction**: Humanitarian aid will be sent to the region, and reconstruction efforts will begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

Additionally, the government and the TPLF agreed to promote the peace deal and call on all Ethiopians, both domestically and abroad, to support the agreement, using language designed to promote national unity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

The agreement is a clear victory for the Ethiopian Government but offers enough to the TPLF to secure its support in the face of final defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. The federal government agreed to the deal, despite being close to a full victory, to spare a final onslaught and further horrific loss of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. Preserving a demilitarized TPLF politically in the north may be more valuable than imposing a resented new administration after a catastrophic military defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.

Considerable encouragement and coercion likely occurred behind the scenes, possibly including promises of reconstruction aid and warnings of serious sanctions or war crimes investigations if cooperation failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. The deal also appears to pave the way for internal arrangements for justice and reconciliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

### Outlook

The agreement is a remarkable achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. The African Union and IGAD (the main regional organization), along with the United States, deserve special credit for their roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. Had the talks failed, the situation could have led to a truly horrific scenario, possibly even genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.

While the conflict cannot be definitively declared over, much depends on the implementation of the agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. Skepticism remains about the sides' ability to mend fences given the deep hatred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. However, after two years of bitter and bloody conflict that resulted in hundreds of thousands dead and millions displaced, Ethiopia appears to be on the path to peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

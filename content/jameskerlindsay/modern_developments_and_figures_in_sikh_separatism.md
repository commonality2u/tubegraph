Over the course of 2023, there have been growing fears regarding the [[rise_of_sikh_separatist_sentiment_in_india | rise of Sikh separatist sentiment in India]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This sentiment, often fueled by charismatic preachers, has led to significant crackdowns by Indian authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The aspiration for an independent Sikh state, known as Khalistan, has a long and often violent history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Recent Resurgence of Sentiment (2018-Present)

Reports of renewed militancy in Punjab emerged in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. Following this, the Indian government banned the U.S.-based group 'Sikhs for Justice', accusing it of destabilizing India's peace, unity, and integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

While some attributed the growing tensions to Pakistan's influence, others pointed to rising poverty in Punjab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Punjab, once one of India's wealthiest states due to its successful farming sector, had been experiencing a steady decline, leading to social problems and major protests in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

## Key Figure: Amritpal Singh

Amidst these rising tensions, a new pro-independence figure, Amritpal Singh, began to emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. Singh conspicuously modeled himself on Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, the militant commander killed during [[Impact of Operation Blue Star and 1984 antiSikh riots | Operation Blue Star]] in 1984 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. He rose to lead a group called 'Heirs of Punjab' after its founder died in a car accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

In February 2023, hundreds of Singh's supporters stormed a jail following the arrest of a group member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. This event raised fears of an increasingly militant pro-independence group re-emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. Consequently, police launched a massive manhunt for Singh the following month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. The manhunt concluded on April 23, 2023, when Singh was peacefully arrested in a village in central Punjab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. He has since been detained under India's National Security Act, which permits detention for up to a year without charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

## Current Outlook in India

Despite concerns, there were no widespread protests following Singh's arrest, as some had feared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. Many observers contend that most Indian Sikhs oppose violent separatism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. However, fears of a return to past violence persist, and police continue to exercise caution, insisting that Singh could still pose a danger if released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. For now, a new wave of violence and pro-separatist sentiment seems unlikely within India itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

## [[International dimension and responses to Sikh separatism | International Dimension and Responses]]

The effects of these developments are also being felt internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. The Indian government has expressed concerns about the security of its diplomatic missions in Canada following protests outside its Consulate in Vancouver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

Additionally, a new government commission report in the United Kingdom highlighted a growing pro-Khalistan extremist element within the British Sikh community, much to the anger of community leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. These events demonstrate that while the prospect of a violent new phase of Sikh separatism in Punjab appears unlikely, the idea of an independent Sikh homeland retains its appeal, both in India and abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

Separatist sentiment in Alberta, a western Canadian province, has seen a significant increase in recent years, drawing international attention that was previously focused on Quebec <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. While separatism is often driven by ethnic, linguistic, or religious differences, Alberta's movement is primarily fueled by economic and political factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Alberta's Profile
Alberta is the fourth largest province in Canada by both size and population, with approximately 5 million inhabitants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Its economy is largely dominated by oil and gas exploration, making it the third largest provincial economy after Ontario and Quebec, contributing between 15% and 20% of Canada's overall GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Historical Roots
The sentiment for separation in Alberta has deep historical roots, dating back almost to its entry into the federation in 1905 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

### Early Marginalization
Upon joining Canada, Alberta felt politically marginalized and economically exploited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Unlike older federal provinces, Alberta was not granted control over its own natural resources until 1930 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

### The National Energy Program (NEP)
A crucial turning point occurred in the 1980s when the Canadian government, under Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, introduced the National Energy Program (NEP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. This policy was widely perceived in the oil and gas-rich West as a federal "power grab" that redistributed income from energy-producing states to other parts of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. The NEP intensified latent suspicion of the federal government, especially given Alberta's strong conservative political leanings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. This led to the emergence of the openly separatist political party, the Western Canada Concept, which even won a seat in the provincial assembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. However, the movement eventually subsided by the late 1980s, shifting focus towards greater autonomy within Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

### Receding from Public View
Under Stephen Harper, an Albertan who served as Conservative Prime Minister from 2006 to 2015, separatist sentiment in Alberta largely receded from public view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

## Recent Resurgence
Despite its temporary decline, the push for independence in Alberta has made a remarkable resurgence over the past decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

### Drivers of Resurgence
The resurgence has been driven by two interrelated factors:
*   **Political Marginalization:** A decade of Liberal Party rule under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (son of Pierre Trudeau) has created an increasing sense of political marginalization in Alberta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. The Liberal Party's share of the vote in Alberta was less than 14% in the 2015, 2019, and 2021 national elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
*   **Economic Grievances:** Many Albertans view Liberal Party policies as fundamentally opposed to the province's economic interests, particularly regarding the energy sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. The federal revenue-sharing arrangement, known as the "equalization formula," is also widely resented, as many Albertans believe their province contributes disproportionately to federal revenues despite its own economic problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

These factors have led to a growing belief that the existing federal arrangements work against Alberta, fueling separatist sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. Opinion polls in 2020 and 2021 indicated that up to 40% of Albertans would vote for independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

### Separatist Movements and Ideas
This trend spurred movements like Western Exit (Wexit) and the Maverick Party, which advocated for the separation of not only Alberta but also broader Western Canada, including Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and British Columbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. Interestingly, polling also suggested that as many as 20% of Albertans favored [[potential_us_annexation_of_alberta | leaving Canada to become the 51st U.S. state]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

### Calls for Greater Autonomy
The Alberta provincial government has capitalized on this sentiment, calling for greater autonomy and launching initiatives such as the 2021 Fair Deal Panel and the 2022 Alberta Sovereignty Within the United Canada Act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

## Current Developments and Future Outlook
While support for independence slightly declined in 2023 and early 2024, it is now rising again, with a potential for a referendum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

### Recent Drivers
The renewed resurgence is attributed to two broad developments:
*   **Donald Trump's Reelection:** The reelection of Donald Trump as U.S. President in November 2024 is seen as a factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. Many Albertans feel a political affinity with U.S. conservatives, and Trump's support for fossil fuels is welcomed in the province due to its reliance on oil and gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Alberta's response to Trump's policies towards Canada, such as tariffs and threats of annexation, has been far more muted than the rest of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. Premier Danielle Smith, accused of flirting with the pro-independence movement, refused to endorse a joint federal-provincial response to U.S. import taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.
*   **Liberal Party Resurgence:** The surprise win of the Liberal Party against the Conservatives in the April 2025 general election is expected to feed into Alberta's sense of political marginalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. Polling suggests that support for secession would grow if the Liberals won a third term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. Premier Smith has issued a warning to the new Canadian Prime Minister, Mark Carney, stating that while Albertans are proud Canadians, they will not tolerate threats to their industries, hinting at an independence vote if the new government pursues "hostile acts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

### Prospects for Separation
Canada has a clearly defined route for separation, thanks to the Clarity Act, making an independence referendum a possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. However, a vote for full independence appears unlikely at this stage, as full-scale separatism remains a minority position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. The future of the movement largely depends on the relationship between the provincial and federal governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. If tensions rise and Ottawa is perceived as acting against Albertan interests, support for independence could increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. Any secession process is unlikely to be swift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

### Implications for Canada
[[potential_us_annexation_of_alberta | Annexation by the United States]] is considered even less likely, as it remains a fringe viewpoint, and support for this option may decline as negative effects of Trump's economic policies become apparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.

The greater threat is that if Alberta were to break away, other provinces might follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. Polling indicates relatively high support for independence in neighboring Saskatchewan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. If Alberta and Saskatchewan were to secede, Manitoba and British Columbia, which also have their own sovereigntist movements, might view separation more favorably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. This scenario could also reignite a new push for independence in [[Quebec independence movement | Quebec]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. The debates in Alberta, therefore, have significant implications for Canada's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.

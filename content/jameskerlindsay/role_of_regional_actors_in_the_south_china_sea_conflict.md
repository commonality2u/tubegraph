Growing concerns have emerged regarding [[increasing_military_activity_in_the_south_china_sea | increasing military activity]] around the [[international_territorial_disputes_over_the_spratly_islands | Spratly islands]] in the South China Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This situation has sparked renewed fears about the possibility of an [[potential_for_armed_conflict_in_the_south_china_sea | armed conflict]] in an area where no fewer than six different actors have territorial claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Nature of the Dispute

While territorial disputes often involve contested land borders, they primarily revolve around maritime boundaries, encompassing competing claims over territorial waters and exclusive economic zones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. In the South China Sea, the dispute over the [[international_territorial_disputes_over_the_spratly_islands | Spratly islands]] exemplifies how control over a small territory can lead to significantly extended maritime and airspace rights over a vast area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. The islands, largely uninhabited, comprise over a hundred tiny islets, reefs, and atolls, many of which are wholly or partially submerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. At most, 20 are considered significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Although small, they cover approximately 400,000 square kilometres (160,000 square miles), making them militarily, economically, and strategically valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. By claiming territory, countries can control territorial waters and undersea resources, including one of the world's most crucial shipping lanes, significant fishing banks, and believed oil and gas deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## Main Claimants

The [[international_territorial_disputes_over_the_spratly_islands | Spratly islands]] have been disputed for over a century, with tensions steadily increasing over recent decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Six parties claim the islands, either in whole or in part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>:
*   China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>
*   Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>
*   Vietnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>
*   The Philippines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>
*   Malaysia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>
*   Brunei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>

## Historical Claims and Escalation

The islands' history is believed to date back almost 2,000 years, first discovered by Chinese fishermen and later mentioned in Imperial Chinese records as an extension of the Paracel Islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. However, the question of sovereignty became hotly contested after the Second World War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

*   **China and Taiwan**: In 1947, the Republic of China (later Taiwan) published a map indicating the [[international_territorial_disputes_over_the_spratly_islands | Spratly islands]] as part of Chinese territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. The Communist People's Republic of China, established in 1949, also claimed the islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   **Vietnam and Philippines**: By the decade following WWII, broader regional competition grew, with Vietnam and the Philippines, now independent states, also claiming sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **Militarization**: The issue became more dangerous as countries began establishing small military presences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Taiwan set up an outpost on Itu Aba in 1956 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, followed by Vietnam and the Philippines in the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   **Malaysia and Brunei**: Malaysia claimed part of the territory in 1983 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, and Brunei claimed a section after gaining independence in 1984 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

## Assertions and Clashes

The situation became increasingly complex and tense by the late 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **China-Vietnam Conflict**: In 1988, violence erupted when China forcibly removed the unified Vietnamese military presence in one part of the islands during the "Battle of Johnson South Reef" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Earlier, in 1974, Chinese and South Vietnamese naval forces clashed over the Paracel Islands, resulting in over 70 deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
*   **China's Land Reclamation**: Beijing gradually tried to cement its control by launching an ambitious scheme to reclaim land around reefs and atolls, creating artificial islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. This activity dramatically increased in 2013, with an estimated 13 square kilometres (five square miles) of land reclaimed over three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. China has now constructed military bases on three of the islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Other Claimants' Actions**: Several other claimants have also become more active. Vietnam has reportedly begun dredging parts of the territory, creating about 220 hectares of new land in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. Malaysia retains control of a reef captured in the 1980s, which it has since turned into an island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. Brunei is the only one of the six not to have a presence on the islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
*   **Indonesia's Challenge**: Although Indonesia does not claim the islands, it has publicly challenged [[Chinas_historical_claims_versus_international_law_in_the_south_china_sea | China's claim]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

## Legal Challenges and Responses

In 2013, the Philippines referred [[Chinas_historical_claims_versus_international_law_in_the_south_china_sea | China's claims]] to the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. Manila argued that Beijing had no right to claim sovereignty over the islands based solely on [[chinas_historical_claims_versus_international_law_in_the_south_china_sea | history]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>, advocating instead that any claim should be judged by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

China refused to participate in the proceedings, disputing the Court's jurisdiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. The Court's nuanced ruling went against China, stating that rights to maritime zones should be based on UNCLOS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. It found that China's actions, including land reclamation, had aggravated the situation and infringed on the Philippines' rights within its exclusive economic zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Furthermore, the Court ruled that none of the [[international_territorial_disputes_over_the_spratly_islands | Spratly Islands]] were "islands" as understood under UNCLOS, meaning even if China had sovereignty, it would not confer an exclusive economic zone that would infringe on other states' rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. The Court called on both parties to comply with UNCLOS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

As expected, China refused to accept the ruling, fundamentally rejecting the findings and calling the arbitration case "pure political drama" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. The Chinese [[the_role_of_government_and_potential_solutions_in_regional_conflicts | government]] also refuses to take the issue of island ownership before another legal body, such as the International Court of Justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

## Recent Tensions

Tensions have continued to rise. In early February 2023, the Philippines [[the_role_of_government_and_potential_solutions_in_regional_conflicts | government]] filed a complaint accusing the Chinese Coast Guard of shadowing, harassing, dangerous manoeuvres, and directing a military-grade laser at one of its vessels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. This incident, while not leading to an exchange of fire, has fueled growing tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. The Philippines now accuses China of threatening its sovereignty and security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has suggested that the Armed Forces of the Philippines must reorient their mission against Beijing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

## Outlook

The [[international_territorial_disputes_over_the_spratly_islands | Spratly Islands]] dispute is an exceedingly complex issue with many countries claiming some or all of the islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. While UNCLOS provides clarity, a resolution model based on it would effectively exclude China and Taiwan, creating current problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. The core questions remain how far [[Chinas_influence_in_the_pacific_and_its_implications_for_us_strategy | China]] is willing to push its disputed claim and how far other states are prepared to defend their positions, especially if it leads to an [[potential_for_armed_conflict_in_the_south_china_sea | armed confrontation]] with Beijing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. There is a sense that the [[international_territorial_disputes_over_the_spratly_islands | Spratly Islands]] may be a more likely focal point for conflict than other regional flashpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. Given the sheer number of actors involved, this collection of rocks, reefs, and atolls could become the centre of a bitter regional war if not handled carefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

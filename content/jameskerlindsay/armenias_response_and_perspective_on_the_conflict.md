In October and early November 2020, [[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict | Armenia and Azerbaijan]] engaged in a brief but bloody conflict over [[azerbaijan_and_armenian_conflict_in_nagornokarabakh | Nagorno-Karabakh]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. After 44 days of fighting, Azerbaijani forces retook significant territory, leading to a Moscow-brokered ceasefire agreement that involved Russian peacekeepers in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. A year after the conflict, the perspective in Armenia reveals profound impacts and complex views on the war's causes, outcomes, and future implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Background of the Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict

The issue of [[azerbaijan_and_armenian_conflict_in_nagornokarabakh | Nagorno-Karabakh]] emerged with the dissolution of the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Predominantly inhabited by ethnic Armenians, [[azerbaijan_and_armenian_conflict_in_nagornokarabakh | Nagorno-Karabakh]] was an autonomous province within Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Upon the USSR's disintegration, it declared independence in January 1992, sparking a bitter war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This conflict resulted in the Armenian side consolidating control over [[azerbaijan_and_armenian_conflict_in_nagornokarabakh | Nagorno-Karabakh]] and seizing surrounding Azerbaijani districts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

For nearly three decades, the conflict over [[azerbaijan_and_armenian_conflict_in_nagornokarabakh | Nagorno-Karabakh]] was considered one of the most serious territorial conflicts globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Despite efforts to resolve it and an agreement on guiding settlement principles, little progress was made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Though often seen as a "frozen conflict," there were frequent confrontations along the ceasefire line and several major outbreaks of fighting, including a four-day conflict in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. In July 2020, another outbreak occurred, serving as a prelude to the full-scale war that erupted at the end of September 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. This six-week war resulted in Azerbaijani forces retaking all Armenian-held areas surrounding [[azerbaijan_and_armenian_conflict_in_nagornokarabakh | Nagorno-Karabakh]] and a considerable part of the region itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. What remains under Armenian control is now protected by Russian peacekeepers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

## Armenian Perspective on the 2020 War

### Awareness and Expectation of Conflict
From Armenia's perspective, the war was not only expected but often seen as unavoidable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. There was an awareness of Azerbaijan's military buildup, arms purchases, and statements indicating a readiness to retake [[azerbaijan_and_armenian_conflict_in_nagornokarabakh | Nagorno-Karabakh]] by force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Many in Yerevan believe Azerbaijan had decided on a conflict and was not interested in a negotiated settlement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

### Explaining the Defeat
The defeat in the 2020 conflict is an "extremely sensitive and difficult subject" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. It has challenged a long-held sense of invulnerability that existed while Armenia controlled [[azerbaijan_and_armenian_conflict_in_nagornokarabakh | Nagorno-Karabakh]] and its surrounding areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Armenians reconcile this defeat by expressing anger about Turkey's support for Azerbaijan, including equipment, military leadership, and guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Many believe Turkey "directed the war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. There is a deeply held view that Azerbaijan "didn't engage in a fair fight," suggesting the outcome would have differed without Turkish and, to some extent, Israeli technical support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

### Perception of Outside Actors
The role of international actors is viewed with varying degrees of disappointment and suspicion:

*   **European Union and United States**: There is "a clear sense of disillusionment about their lack of action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Beyond the moral obligation to stop the war, there's a geopolitical and even civilizational aspect to this view. Many believe Armenia's vital position, preventing a "Turkic arc stretching from Europe to Central Asia," should be understood and fully supported by Western powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   [[armenia_russia_relations_and_tension | Russia]]: The picture regarding [[armenia_russia_relations_and_tension | Russia]] is the most complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. While Armenia has historically had a close relationship with Moscow, and many still consider [[armenia_russia_relations_and_tension | Russia]] a key ally, there is a "real sense of anger and suspicion about [[armenia_russia_relations_and_tension | Russia]]'s role in the war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. This stems from [[armenia_russia_relations_and_tension | Russia]] only stepping in at the last moment, after most Armenian-held territory was lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Trust in [[armenia_russia_relations_and_tension | Russia]] seems to arise more from a sense of having no other choice, rather than genuine faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

## [[impact_of_the_war_on_armenian_society | Impact of the War on Armenian Society]]

On the surface, particularly in central Yerevan, there is little to indicate a country recovering from a major war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. The city appears remarkably normal, bustling with restaurants, high-end shops, and nice cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. However, beneath this apparent normality, the war has had a profound effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. No family was left untouched; many volunteered to fight, thousands were killed, and many are still missing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Occasional stark reminders, such as plaques dedicated to fallen soldiers, serve as testament to the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

## [[future_of_armenia_and_nagornokarabakh | Future Outlook]]

There is a strong sense of "unfinished business" in Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. This includes:

*   **Unresolved Issues of the 2020 Conflict**: Armenian soldiers are still held prisoner by Azerbaijan, with allegations of torture and executions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
*   **Continued Skirmishes**: The 2020 conflict is not truly perceived as over, with ongoing skirmishes along the new ceasefire line, including heavy fighting in November 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Many fear a full-scale conflict could erupt again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
*   **Nagorno-Karabakh's Status**: For the longer term, there's an outward sense that people have not given up on [[future_of_armenia_and_nagornokarabakh | Nagorno-Karabakh]], which they still view as Armenian territory that will eventually be retaken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. This belief is sincere, reflecting a view that [[azerbaijan_and_armenian_conflict_in_nagornokarabakh | Nagorno-Karabakh]] should be part of Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Just as Azerbaijanis spoke of their territory being held by Armenians, Armenians now speak of their territory being held by Azerbaijanis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

The idea of a compromise involving some form of territorial autonomy for [[azerbaijan_and_armenian_conflict_in_nagornokarabakh | Nagorno-Karabakh]] does not seem acceptable to either side currently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. From Armenia's perspective, it is "far too soon to talk about any longer-term settlement, let alone reconciliation," between [[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict | Armenia and Azerbaijan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

The war, though expected, proved quicker and more decisive than many in Armenia anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. Armenians widely believe Azerbaijan secured victory only with outside assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. Despite the surface appearance of normality in Yerevan, there is a profound underlying sense that the country is "still in the state of denial about what happened" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

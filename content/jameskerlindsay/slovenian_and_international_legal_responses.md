The story of the "erased" in Slovenia describes a severe [[human_rights_violations_in_postindependence_slovenia | human rights violation]] that emerged following Slovenia's declaration of independence from Yugoslavia in 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This issue concerns the deliberate deletion of tens of thousands of Yugoslavs living in Slovenia from permanent resident lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. The consequences for these individuals were catastrophic, leading to a protracted legal battle both domestically and internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

## Initial Slovenian Actions and Domestic Court Rulings

Upon breaking away from Yugoslavia, Slovenia initiated state-building processes, including new legislation requiring all Yugoslav citizens in the country to apply for Slovenian citizenship by December 26, 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. While 170,000 people applied, tens of thousands missed this deadline, often due to unawareness of its significance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Some applications were rejected, particularly from those who had served in the Yugoslav Army attempting to prevent Slovenia's secession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

In February 1992, the Slovenian government ordered that those who had not applied for citizenship be deleted from permanent resident lists and re-registered as foreigners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Their Slovenian documents, such as identity cards or driverâ€™s licenses, were annulled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. In total, 25,671 people were affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. These individuals lost access to state services, pensions, housing, healthcare, social rights, and employment, with some becoming stateless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Many were forced to leave the country or were deported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

Despite efforts by those affected, the Slovenian Government showed little interest in resolving the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

### Slovenian Constitutional Court Rulings
In 1999, the issue was brought before the Slovenian Constitutional Court. The court ruled that the deletion of records was unlawful and ordered the government to address it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. In response, new legislation provided a three-month window for affected individuals to apply for Slovenian citizenship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. However, this legislation did not address the problems faced by "the erased" over the preceding decade, nor did it allow those expelled to return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

Consequently, in 2003, the Constitutional Court issued another ruling, stating that the rights of those affected should be applied retrospectively from the point their records were deleted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Despite this, the government continued to refuse retrospective measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Thousands continued to face problems registering or securing full state pensions, and there was no compensation for their suffering or legal costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

The issue became increasingly politicized, with many ordinary Slovenes expressing little sympathy for the affected group, often viewing them as foreign economic migrants or enemies of the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. A referendum held in April 2004, asking whether "the erased" should have their rights returned, saw 94% of participants vote 'No' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

## International Pressure and Legal Proceedings

With Slovenia joining the European Union on May 1, 2004 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>, its government faced increasing pressure from human rights organizations and leading [[international_relations_and_recognition_of_kosovo | international bodies]], including the United Nations and the Council of Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

### European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR)
In 2006, eleven of "the erased" brought their case before the European Court of Human Rights, Europe's highest legal body for human rights issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Four years later, the ECtHR ruled in their favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. Slovenia's government challenged this ruling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

In 2012, the Grand Chamber of the ECtHR confirmed that Slovenia had violated Articles 8, 13, and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. These articles guarantee respect for private and family life, the right to an effective remedy, and the prohibition of discrimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. Slovenia was given one year to establish a compensation scheme, which it failed to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

As a result, in 2014, the Court ordered Slovenia to pay almost a quarter of a million euros in compensation to the applicants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. Facing a "massive wave of cases," the Slovenian government finally decided to comply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. It committed to ending human rights violations, preventing future ones, and establishing a compensation scheme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. By February 2016, 22 million euros had been paid to approximately 5,300 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

On May 25, 2016, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, responsible for supervising the execution of the Court's judgments, declared Slovenia's measures satisfactory and considered the matter closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

## Ongoing Challenges

Despite the rulings and compensation, many of "the erased" still face injustice, being ineligible for the scheme or unable to afford legal fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. Three decades after the events, many continue to fight for justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

The case of "the erased" in Slovenia highlights the complexities of citizenship and human rights during state dissolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. While Slovenia avoided the brutal conflicts seen elsewhere in Yugoslavia, a significant human rights issue persisted, with successive governments refusing to act despite numerous national and [[international_legal_proceedings_from_the_conflict | international court rulings]], only complying when faced with substantial financial penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.

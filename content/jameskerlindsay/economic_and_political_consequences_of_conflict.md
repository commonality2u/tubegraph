The decision to use armed force is not taken lightly, as the implications of conflict can be extensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Beyond military dimensions, broader political, economic, domestic, and [[impact_on_international_relations | international factors]] must be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Even if a war is militarily "won" easily, the wider effects can be severely damaging, embodying the concept of a pyrrhic victory where the cost outweighs the gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. A complex range of costs and benefits must be weighed before military action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Case Study: Russia-Ukraine Conflict

Concerns have grown that Russia is preparing a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, having amassed over 100,000 troops near the border and imposing unacceptable de-escalation conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This situation serves as an important case in point for examining the factors considered in a decision to go to war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

### Background of the Conflict

Ukraine, located in Eastern Europe, is the 45th largest UN member by area and has a population of around 44 million, with ethnic Ukrainians comprising 78% and Russians 17% as per the 2001 census <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Russia, the world's largest country, has a population of approximately 144 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

The current crisis stems from the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Following independence, issues such as nuclear weapons in Ukraine and the status of the Soviet fleet in the Crimean Peninsula (ceded by Russia to Ukraine in the 1950s) remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Ukraine transferred its missiles to Russia in exchange for a Russian guarantee to respect its sovereignty and territorial integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. The navy was later divided, with Russia gaining control of the port in Crimea until 2042 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

While Ukraine joined the Commonwealth of Independent States, many Ukrainians sought closer ties with the West, including EU and NATO membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. In November 2013, Ukraine's pro-Russian president blocked an association agreement with the EU, leading to mass protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. After the president fled to Russia, Russia invaded and annexed Crimea, then supported a separatist insurgency in the eastern Donbas provinces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Fighting continued despite ceasefire agreements, resulting in around 14,000 lives lost and 1.5 million displaced by 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

Russia cemented control by granting Russian citizenship to inhabitants of the east and openly stated its desire for Ukraine to remain firmly within Russia's sphere of influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Russian President Vladimir Putin insisted that Russians and Ukrainians are "one people" and that "the true sovereignty of Ukraine is possible only in partnership with Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. In December 2021, Moscow presented draft treaties to the US and NATO, demanding an end to further NATO expansion, including to Ukraine or any former USSR territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. NATO rejected this, asserting that membership is a matter for the organization and applicants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

### Russian Objectives for Invasion

Russia's significant troop buildup, estimated at 120,000 troops within 200 kilometers of the border, signals a strong resolve over Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. While protecting ethnic Russians was an objective in 2013, Russia now controls key ethnic Russian districts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Further expansion would involve areas predominantly inhabited by ethnic Ukrainians, which doesn't clearly support full control of Ukraine given the enormous military, economic, political, and diplomatic costs of occupation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. A partial invasion would likely make the rest of Ukraine even more anti-Russian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

Although Moscow views NATO as a threat and claims NATO promised not to expand into the former Soviet Union, an invasion might not change the current situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. While NATO has been hesitant to admit Ukraine with its conflict, an invasion could encourage NATO enlargement elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Notably, Finland's president and prime minister have hinted at NATO membership if Russia acts in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Given Finland's 1,300 km border with Russia, this would lead to *more* NATO presence for Russia, not less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

The most plausible objective for an invasion is to stop NATO enlargement to Ukraine and secure Russia's hold over already controlled territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Invading eastern Ukraine could provide leverage to formally secure Ukraine's acceptance of Crimea's annexation and perhaps the transfer of Donbas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Even without immediate formal acceptance, Russia would see this as a powerful message about its global standing and willingness to act in its interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

## Consequences of Conflict for Russia

### Military Risks and External Intervention

While Russia's forces vastly outnumber Ukraine's, Kyiv has significantly improved its military capabilities since 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Observers suggest a successful invasion would require more Russian troops than currently assembled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. Direct outside military support for Ukraine would be limited; no country will fight for Ukraine, as going to war with Russia is out of the question for NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. However, NATO, the EU, and US President Biden have warned that further aggression would have "massive consequences and would carry a high price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

### Political Consequences

The political effects of an invasion on Russia would be mixed, perhaps not as severe as imagined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. As a veto-wielding permanent member of the UN Security Council, Russia would face no formal UNSC resolution against its actions, though there might be one from the General Assembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. While any action would deepen political estrangement from the West, Russia has already drifted away from Europe and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. Many other countries might be ambivalent about taking tough action, as Russia maintains significant influence and is adept at leveraging its capabilities for maximum [[role_of_international_actors_and_geopolitical_implications | geopolitical advantage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. President Putin may feel he can absorb new political costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

### Economic Consequences

EU and NATO action would be most effective in the economic sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. Although many sanctions have been imposed since 2013, other areas could be targeted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Energy is one area for potentially decisive action, as Europe is a key market for Russian natural gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. However, Russia has record gold and foreign exchange reserves, providing a "war chest" to weather immediate sanction consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Putin also knows that cutting off energy would significantly impact already high energy prices in Europe, incurring a major domestic political cost for Western countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

A longer-term option is to shift away from Russian energy sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken suggested Germany cancel Nord Stream 2, a gas pipeline bypassing Ukraine and linking Russia and Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. While this would hit Russia hard, especially as Germany is Russia's largest gas market, it wouldn't have an immediate effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. Cancellation would also raise concerns about Europe's long-term energy strategies, as Russia and many in the EU view the project as a point of Russian leverage over Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

## Conclusion

An invasion could deter NATO enlargement to Ukraine, provide leverage to secure Russian gains in the east, and send a powerful message about Russia's resolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. Although military costs could be high, Russia knows that external intervention is improbable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. The decision hinges on Russia's objectives and its ability to withstand the longer-term political and economic effects, which may not be as severe as many perceive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. The threat of an invasion remains very real, and even if diplomatic efforts succeed for now, the possibility of future military action is a real prospect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

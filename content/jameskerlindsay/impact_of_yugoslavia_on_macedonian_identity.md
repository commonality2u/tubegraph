The historical development of a distinct Macedonian identity is closely intertwined with the period of Yugoslavia's existence, particularly after World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

## Autonomy Within Yugoslavia

Following the Second World War, the northern part of Macedonia gained autonomy, rather than being reintegrated into Serbia as it had been previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. This region eventually became the Socialist Republic of Macedonia, one of the six constituent republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

## Fostering a Distinct Identity

In the years that followed, a conscious effort was made within Yugoslavia to foster a wholly distinct Macedonian identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. This process emphasized a very different and distinct relationship, history, language, and culture compared to neighbouring Bulgaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

In the 1970s, the Macedonian language, although mutually intelligible with Bulgarian, was officially registered as a separate language by the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

## Independence and Nationhood

This sense of nationhood fostered during the Yugoslav era came to the fore as [[yugoslavias_breakup_and_slovenias_independence | Yugoslavia disintegrated]] at the start of the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. On September 8, 1991, Socialist Macedonia overwhelmingly voted to break away and become a separate sovereign state, the Republic of Macedonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

## Bulgaria's Perspective

The [[historical_and_cultural_identity_issues_between_bulgaria_and_north_macedonia | dispute between Bulgaria and North Macedonia]] over identity is deeply rooted in this history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Bulgaria disputes the existence of a separate Macedonian nation, viewing the Slavic population of Macedonia as part of the wider Bulgarian nation and the Macedonian language as a dialect of Bulgarian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

Bulgaria's stance is partly based on the belief that the Macedonian identity only emerged as a deliberate Yugoslav policy aimed at demonising Bulgaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. From Sofia's perspective, Slavic Macedonians are "really and truly Bulgarians" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. Conversely, Macedonians assert their separate national identity that, they argue, must be acknowledged and respected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

The ongoing [[international_relations_and_national_identity_in_the_balkans | identity issues in international relations]] underscore how important the concept of nationhood can be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

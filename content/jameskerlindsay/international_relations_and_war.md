The decision to use armed force is a critical aspect of [[international_relations_and_conflict_resolution | international relations]], carrying immense implications across military, political, economic, domestic, and [[impact_on_international_relations | international factors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Even if a war is militarily successful, the broader effects can be extremely damaging, leading to a "pyrrhic victory" where the cost outweighs the gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The ongoing debate about a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine serves as a pertinent example of this complex decision-making process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## The Russia-Ukraine Conflict: A Case Study

Fears of a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine have grown due to the accumulation of over 100,000 troops near the border and Moscow's imposition of unacceptable de-escalation conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This represents a potential new phase in the conflict in eastern Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

### Background to the Conflict

Ukraine is located in eastern Europe, covering 600,000 square kilometers, and has a population of approximately 44 million, with ethnic Ukrainians comprising 78% and Russians around 17% as of the 2001 census <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. To its northeast lies Russia, the world's largest country by area (17 million square kilometers) with a population of about 144 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

The roots of the current crisis stem from the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Following independence, outstanding issues included the stationing of nuclear weapons in Ukraine and the status of the Soviet fleet in the Crimean Peninsula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Crimea, ceded by Russia to Ukraine in the 1950s, was a point of "lingering resentment" for many Russians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. These issues were resolved when Ukraine transferred missiles to Russia in exchange for a Russian guarantee of its sovereignty and territorial integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Later, the navy was divided, and Russia secured control over the port in Crimea until 2042 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

While Ukraine joined the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), a Russian-led organization of former Soviet republics, many Ukrainians advocated for closer ties with the West, including EU and NATO membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### Escalation of the Crisis

The conflict intensified in November 2013, when Ukraine's pro-Russian president blocked an association agreement with the EU, leading to mass protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. After the president fled to Russia, counter-protests emerged in the Russian-speaking east and south <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This precipitated Russia's invasion and annexation of Crimea, followed by support for a separatist insurgency in the Donbas, two Russian-dominated eastern provinces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

Despite ceasefire agreements, fighting continued, resulting in approximately 14,000 deaths and 1.5 million displaced people by 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Russia solidified its control by granting Russian citizenship to inhabitants of the eastern regions and increasingly asserted its desire for Ukraine to remain within Russia's sphere of influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

In December 2021, Moscow presented draft treaties to the United States and NATO, demanding an end to NATO expansion, especially to Ukraine or any former Soviet republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. NATO immediately rejected this, stating that membership is a sovereign matter for the organization and applicants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

### Russian Troop Buildup and Objectives

Estimates suggest around 120,000 Russian troops are within 200 kilometers of the Ukrainian border, fueling fears of an imminent invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. While some observers consider this a bluff, the context has changed, with explicit statements from Russia tying Ukraine's future to Russia and demanding no NATO expansion into the former Soviet Union, indicating a stronger resolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

Russia's objectives extend beyond protecting ethnic Russians in the east, as Moscow already controls key ethnic Russian districts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Further expansion would involve areas predominantly inhabited by ethnic Ukrainians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. A full occupation of Ukraine seems unlikely due to the "enormous" military, economic, political, and diplomatic costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. A partial invasion would likely intensify anti-Russian sentiment in the rest of Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

The argument that an invasion is about controlling NATO's expansion also has flaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. While NATO offered Ukraine membership in 2008, it has not been a realistic prospect for some time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. An invasion, while potentially ending hopes for Ukraine's NATO membership, could paradoxically encourage it elsewhere. For example, Finnish leaders have hinted at NATO membership if Russia acts against Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Given Finland's 1300-kilometer border with Russia, this would result in more, not less, NATO presence on Russia's doorstep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

The most plausible objective for an invasion is to secure Russia's existing territorial gains and prevent NATO enlargement in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Invading a large part of eastern Ukraine could serve as leverage to secure Ukraine's formal acceptance of Russia's annexation of Crimea and potentially the transfer of the Donbas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Such an action would also send a "powerful message" about Russia's global standing and willingness to act in its own interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

## Factors Influencing the Decision for War

When considering an invasion, several factors come into play:

### Military Risks

While Russia's forces vastly outnumber Ukraine's, Kyiv has significantly improved its military capabilities since 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. A successful invasion might require even greater Russian numbers than currently assembled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. Direct outside military support for Ukraine would be limited; while many countries would voice support, none are expected to go to war with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. However, NATO, the EU, and the US have warned of "massive consequences" and a "high price" for further aggression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

### Political Costs and Benefits

Politically, the effects of an invasion would be mixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. As a veto-wielding permanent member of the UN Security Council, Russia would face no formal UNSC resolution against its actions, though the General Assembly might pass one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. While it would lead to further political estrangement from the West, Russia has already drifted away from Europe and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. Many other countries would be ambivalent about tough action, and Russia has shown itself adept at leveraging its capabilities for [[role_of_international_actors_and_geopolitical_implications | geopolitical advantage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. President Putin may believe he can bear new political costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

### Economic Consequences

EU and NATO action would be most effective in the economic sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. Sanctions have already been imposed since 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. The energy sector is a key area for decisive action, as Europe is a major market for Russian natural gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. However, Russia's record gold and foreign exchange reserves provide a significant "war chest" to withstand immediate sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Putin also knows that cutting off energy supplies would greatly impact already high European energy prices, causing major domestic political costs for Western countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

A long-term option is to shift away from Russian energy sources. One suggestion is for Germany to cancel Nord Stream 2, a gas pipeline bypassing Ukraine to link Russia and Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. While this would hit Russia hard, especially as Germany is its largest gas market, the impact wouldn't be immediate and would raise concerns about Europe's longer-term energy strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

## Conclusion

It is difficult to predict whether Russia will invade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. An invasion could deter NATO enlargement to Ukraine, provide leverage for securing existing gains in the east, and send a message about Russia's resolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. While military costs might be high, Russia knows that external intervention is improbable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. The decision ultimately depends on Russia's objectives and its ability to manage the longer-term political and economic effects, which may not be as severe as commonly assumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. Therefore, the threat of an invasion remains very real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>, and even if diplomatic efforts de-escalate the current crisis, the possibility of future military action will likely persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

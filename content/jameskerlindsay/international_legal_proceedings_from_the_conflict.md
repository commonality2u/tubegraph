The conflict involving Croatia and the Republic of Serbian Krajina led to various [[role_of_international_law_in_border_conflicts | international legal proceedings]] aimed at addressing crimes committed during the wars.

## International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY)

The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) was established by the UN Security Council to prosecute war crimes and other human rights abuses committed during the Yugoslav conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

*   **Prosecution of Serbian Figures**
    *   Leaders of the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK) and key Serbian figures, including Slobodan Milosevic (the President of Serbia), were tried for crimes against humanity in Croatia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
    *   These alleged crimes included murder, torture, forcible transportation, deportations, plunder, and destruction of property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

*   **Challenges in Prosecuting Croatians**
    *   Bringing Croatians to trial for their actions during Operation Storm proved more problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
    *   A report by Human Rights Watch, produced a year after Operation Storm, cataloged a wide range of atrocities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. These included attacks on fleeing civilians, and the torture and murder of Serbs who remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
    *   ICTY indictments later accused Croatia's leadership of a "joint criminal enterprise" â€” a carefully planned effort to permanently rid the territory of its Serbian population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
    *   Croatia firmly rejected these claims, arguing Operation Storm was justified and that prosecuting leaders who secured victory was unacceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
    *   Despite this, pressure continued on Zagreb to hand over those accused of war crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

*   **Case of General Ante Gotovina**
    *   General Ante Gotovina, a key Croatian commander in Operation Storm, went into hiding before being arrested in the Canary Islands in 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
    *   He was transferred to the ICTY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.
    *   In 2011, Gotovina was found guilty of war crimes and sentenced to 24 years in jail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
    *   However, in 2012, he and another general were acquitted on appeal in a controversial split decision that focused on technical discussions about artillery fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
    *   Upon his return, Gotovina received a hero's welcome in Croatia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

## International Court of Justice (ICJ)

In July 1999, Croatia launched a case against Serbia at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), accusing Serbia of genocide on Croatian territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. This prompted a counter-claim from Serbia, accusing Croatia of genocide during Operation Storm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

*   **ICJ Rulings**
    *   In judgments delivered in 2008 and 2015, the ICJ ruled that while both sides had committed acts that could constitute genocide, there was no definitive proof of intent to destroy the populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
    *   The court found that the intent was rather to force populations out, not to destroy them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
    *   Therefore, neither side was considered to have contravened the genocide convention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
    *   These [[political_implications_of_the_icj_rulings | rulings]] highlighted the complex legal and political interpretations of the conflict's events.

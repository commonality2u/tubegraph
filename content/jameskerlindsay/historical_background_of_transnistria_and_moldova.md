The [[historical_context_of_moldova_and_transnistria | Transnistria issue]] is a long-standing dispute that has attracted significant international attention, especially with the ongoing war in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. It is one of the "frozen conflicts" that emerged in the former Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.

## Geographical and Demographic Overview

Moldova is situated in southeast Europe, between [[historical_background_of_moldova_and_romania | Romania]] and Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. It covers an area of 34,000 square kilometres (13,000 square miles), making it the 134th largest member of the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. Its population is approximately 2.6 million, predominantly composed of Romanian-speaking Moldovans, with Ukrainians making up about seven percent and Russians around four percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

[[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]], also known as Trans-Dniester, is located at Moldova's eastern edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. It spans 4,200 square kilometres (1,600 square miles), which is slightly over 10% of Moldova's total territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. As of the 2015 census, its population was 475,000, roughly equally divided among three main ethnic groups: Russians (around 29%), Moldovans (around 29%), and Ukrainians (around 23%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

## Historical Background

### Early Origins

Moldova's history originates with the Principality of Moldavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. In 1812, the Ottoman Empire ceded Moldavia's eastern provinces, known as Bessarabia, to Imperial Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. While western Moldavia later united with the Principality of Wallachia in 1881 to form the Kingdom of [[historical_background_of_moldova_and_romania | Romania]], Bessarabia remained under Russian rule until 1917 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.

Following the Russian Revolution in 1917, local leaders in Bessarabia declared independence before uniting with [[historical_background_of_moldova_and_romania | Romania]] a few months later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. However, the newly established Soviet Union did not acknowledge this unification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. In 1924, the Soviet Union established the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (ASSR) within Soviet Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. This entity was located on the east bank of the Dniester River, in a predominantly Slavic area known as Trans-Dniester, which was not traditionally considered part of Romanian-speaking Bessarabia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.

### Soviet Era

The formation of the Moldavian ASSR became a crucial development when the Soviet Union seized control of Bessarabia at the onset of the Second World War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>. On August 2, 1940, Bessarabia and Trans-Dniester were combined to form the Moldovan Soviet Socialist Republic (SSR), becoming one of the 15 top-level republics of the USSR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.

Over the subsequent decades, Moscow intentionally altered the demographic balance within the Moldovan SSR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. By 1989, Romanian-speaking Moldovans constituted approximately two-thirds of the population, with Ukrainians and Russians each making up around 13 percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.

### Post-Soviet Conflict

As the Soviet Union began to weaken, Moldovan leaders increasingly asserted their Romanian-Moldovan identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. This shift generated tensions with [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]], where the population, largely Slavic, maintained closer ties to Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

The situation dramatically changed in August 1991 with the collapse of the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]] unilaterally declared independence, establishing the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. Six months later, on March 2, 1992, the same day the newly independent Republic of Moldova joined the United Nations, significant fighting broke out between Moldovan troops and Transnistrian forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>.

At this critical juncture, the [[russian_influence_and_military_presence_in_transnistria | Russian army stationed in Transnistria]] intervened to defend the breakaway republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. After four and a half months of conflict, which resulted in approximately a thousand deaths, a ceasefire was agreed upon in July 1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>. As part of this agreement, a contingent of [[russian_influence_and_military_presence_in_transnistria | Russian troops]] remained in place as part of an agreed peacekeeping force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. Additionally, Moscow retained a separate contingent of troops in [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]], forces that remain there to this day despite calls for their withdrawal by the UN General Assembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.

This outcome meant that while [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]] remained internationally unrecognized, even by Russia, it effectively became a de facto state under Moscow's protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>.

## Post-Conflict Stalemate

In the years following the conflict, efforts were made to resolve the dispute under the oversight of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Russia, Ukraine, the European Union, and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>. However, a lasting solution proved elusive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>.

Moldova was reluctant to grant significant power to [[transnistria_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Transnistria]], particularly if it would give Russia influence in internal Moldovan affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. Meanwhile, Transnistrian leaders were content with the financial support from Russia and showed no desire to abandon the "criminal statelet" they had established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>. Furthermore, the dispute became a valuable bargaining chip for Moscow, effectively blocking Moldova's aspirations for European Union and NATO membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>.

This complex situation led to a status quo where both sides, despite increasing interactions, seemed comfortable with the unresolved nature of the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>. However, this settled situation is now at risk due to the [[impact_of_the_ukraine_war_on_transnistria | war in Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>.

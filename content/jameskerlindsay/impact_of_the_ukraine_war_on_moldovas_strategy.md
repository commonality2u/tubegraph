The ongoing war in Ukraine has significantly reshaped the strategic landscape for Moldova, particularly concerning its breakaway region of Transnistria. In March 2024, Transnistrian authorities issued an urgent appeal for assistance to Russia, amidst speculation that Moldova might use the war to regain control of the territory, which has been under Russia's protection for over 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Moscow, in turn, has publicly warned that any use of force would be perceived as a direct attack on Russia itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Historical Context of Transnistria

The region of Transnistria, a thin strip of territory along Moldova's eastern border with Ukraine, constitutes approximately 10% of Moldova's landmass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. The conflict stems from historical shifts and Soviet-era policies. Bessarabia, the eastern provinces of the Principality of Moldavia, was ceded to Moscow in the early 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Although Bessarabia united with Romania in 1917, the Soviet Union refused to recognize this and established the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic on the Dniester River's east bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. In 1940, Bessarabia and the Trans-Dniester area were merged to form the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic within the USSR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

After World War II, the Soviet leadership introduced ethnic Russians to control the republic and diminish Romanian nationalist sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. By the late 1980s, Ukrainians and Russians comprised about a quarter of Moldova's population, with many concentrated in Transnistria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. As the Soviet Union weakened, Moldova's leadership emphasized its Romanian heritage, leading to tensions with Transnistria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

In August 1991, Transnistrian leaders declared the region's breakaway, forming the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (PMR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. Fighting erupted on March 2, 1992, the day Moldova joined the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Russian troops stationed in Transnistria intervened, and a ceasefire four and a half months later established Russia as a guarantor of the de facto state's existence, maintaining a separate military contingent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Around 1,500 Russian troops remain in Transnistria despite UN General Assembly calls for their withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

## Pre-Ukraine War Status Quo

For decades, international efforts to resolve the Transnistrian issue failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Moldova's reluctance to integrate more Russian speakers, who would strengthen Moscow's influence, and Transnistria's desire to maintain Russian subsidies and earnings from illicit activities, contributed to the stalemate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. This unresolved conflict also benefited Moscow, as it prevented Moldova from moving closer to the West, as neither the EU nor NATO would be interested in accepting a divided state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Moldova, moreover, was constitutionally committed to neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

## Impact of the Ukraine War on Moldova's Strategy

The start of Russia's war in Ukraine in February 2022 "radically reshaped the status quo" for Moldova <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

### Initial Fears and Pivot to the West

With a staunchly pro-European president, Maia Sandu, elected just over a year prior, there were fears that if Russian forces seized control of Ukraine, Moldova would become Moscow's next target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. A series of attacks in Transnistria in mid-2022 were seen by many as a potential pretext for a Russian invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

In response, Moldova took urgent steps to move closer to the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. While some suggested dropping its neutrality and joining NATO, Moldova instead focused on EU membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. It applied to join the bloc in March 2022, was granted candidate status three months later, and received clearance to start formal membership talks in December 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

### Shifting Military Calculus and Assertiveness

Although there were persistent suggestions of Russian plans to overthrow the Moldovan government through demonstrations or a coup, the direct threat of a Russian military invasion receded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. Ukrainian forces' limited progress in their June 2023 counteroffensive diminished the prospect of Russian forces breaking through southern Ukraine to link up with their garrison in Transnistria, which had been a primary concern at the war's outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

This strategic shift in Ukraine significantly altered the debate over Transnistria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. With the immediate threat of a Russian invasion of Moldova seemingly gone, attention turned to the possibility of a Moldovan attempt to retake Transnistria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. Calls for this were bolstered by Azerbaijan's successful military offensive to retake Nagorno-Karabakh after 30 years of Armenian control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. While Russia warned against force, the Moldovan government dismissed fears of Russian retaliation, arguing that Russia's military options have "collapsed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

Indeed, with Russia cut off from Transnistria, Moldova has become more assertive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. This was evident when Ukraine closed its border with Transnistria, severely reducing trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Moldova then introduced tariffs on goods entering Transnistria from its side, a move Transnistrian leaders dubbed an "economic blockade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. This led to Transnistrian authorities convening a rare "Congress of Deputies at all Levels" in February 2024, which called on Moscow for help but stopped short of requesting formal annexation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

## Moldova's Current Strategy: Peaceful Resolution

Despite the increased assertiveness and changing circumstances, Moldova's strategy remains committed to a peaceful resolution rather than military action.

### Reasons Against Military Action

*   **Commitment to Peace**: Moldova has consistently insisted on a peaceful resolution, and there is no history of deep ethnic hostility between the sides, unlike other separatist conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
*   **Military Limitations**: Moldova's armed forces are small and comparatively weak, and while defense spending has increased, there are no signs of readiness for an invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. Even if an invasion were attempted, success is not guaranteed, as Transnistrians might resist, and the region is increasing its security forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. Outside forces, such as NATO, may also avoid sending combat troops, though Romania might act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.
*   **Political Risks**: Forcible integration of Transnistria could ironically strengthen pro-Russian sentiment within Moldova, making Moscow more powerful in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

### Signs of Waning Russian Influence and European Integration

Moldova's "softly-softly" approach is further supported by signs that Moscow's influence in Transnistria may be waning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. Turnout for the recent Russian presidential election was significantly lower in Transnistria than in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

Simultaneously, Transnistria is gradually shifting towards Europe economically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. With Russia cut off, trade with the European Union has substantially increased, now accounting for approximately 70% of Transnistria's imports and exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

For these reasons, Moldova's strategy appears to favor letting the situation remain as it is for now, in the hope that a peaceful, organic reunification may eventually be possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.

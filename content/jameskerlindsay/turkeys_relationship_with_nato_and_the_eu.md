At the NATO leaders' summit in Vilnius, international attention focused on Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. After months of negotiation, many wondered if he would permit Sweden to join the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Surprisingly, he linked the decision to [[Turkeys relationship with European Union and membership aspirations | Turkey's long-stalled European Union membership talks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Although he eventually accepted Swedish membership, his motivation for raising the EU issue raised questions about the future of [[Turkeys diplomatic crisis with the West | Turkey's relationship with its European partners]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Historical Context

[[Turkeys historical orientation towards Europe | Turkey has long been seen as an integral part of the Western alliance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. It is a member of NATO and the Council of Europe, and has been a candidate for EU membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. However, over the past decade, Turkey has become increasingly distant from its Western partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. While European leaders bear some responsibility, much of this strain is attributed to the policies of President Erdogan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, who has pushed relations to breaking point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Despite this, there are recent signs that he may seek to rebuild ties with [[Turkeys historical orientation towards Europe | Turkey's traditional allies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

The relationship between Turkey and Europe spans centuries, originating with the Ottoman Empire's rule over parts of the Balkans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. By the late 19th century, the Empire was in decline, referred to as the 'sick man of Europe' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

### Formation of the Republic and Early Alignments

The modern story begins after World War I, when Turkish nationalist forces, led by General Mustafa Kamal, resisted European powers' plans to partition the Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. The Republic of Turkey was formally proclaimed on October 29, 1923 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

From its inception, the new country oriented itself towards Europe and the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Mustafa Kamal, known as Ataturk, implemented radical social reforms, reduced Islam's role, and introduced a Latin script, moving Turkey closer to Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. This westward gaze continued after his death in 1938 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

Despite remaining neutral in World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, Turkey became one of the first members of the Council of Europe in 1949 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Three years later, during the Cold War, it joined NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

### Early European Economic Community (EEC) Hopes

Perhaps the most significant step was in 1963 when Turkey signed an association agreement with the European Economic Community (EEC), the precursor to the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. While there was hope for eventual membership, Turkey's path was hindered by internal political instability, military coups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, and external tensions with [[Turkey Greece Relations | Greece]] over the Aegean Sea and the 1974 invasion of Cyprus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

## Path to EU Membership Under Erdogan

By the late 1990s, the situation began to shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Although Turkey's EU application was rejected in 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, a massive earthquake in Western Turkey in 1999 led to rapprochement with [[Turkey Greece Relations | Greece]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Athens subsequently dropped its objections to Turkish membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

The most profound change occurred in November 2002 when Recep Tayyip Erdogan's Justice and Development Party (AKP) won the general elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. The new government prioritized EU membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Erdogan continued rapprochement with [[Turkey Greece Relations | Greece]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a> and supported a UN plan to reunite Cyprus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. Despite the UN effort failing in 2004 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>, the EU rewarded Turkey's constructive role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. In 2005, EU leaders agreed to open membership negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

Over the following years, Turkey made progress, reforming internal politics, reducing military power, and opening 16 of 33 "chapters" of the acquis communautaire (EU laws) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## Deterioration of Relations Under Erdogan

By the end of the decade, problems emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Erdogan, initially seen as a reformer, became increasingly authoritarian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. This culminated in May 2013 with mass protests across Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. After retaining control, Erdogan tightened his grip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. Following an attempted coup in July 2016, he launched a massive crackdown on political opponents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, resulting in purges across civil service, judiciary, military, and academia, with tens of thousands jailed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. He also changed the constitution to a US-style presidential system, significantly increasing his personal power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

This had a considerable impact on [[Turkeys diplomatic crisis with the West | Turkey's relationship with the West]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

### Stalled EU Membership Talks

EU membership talks ground to a halt due to claims that Turkey no longer met democratic criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. Relations were further strained by issues like the 2015 migrant crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

### Strained NATO and US Relations

Relations with the United States and NATO also became increasingly difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Ankara accused the US of harboring Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkey blamed for the attempted coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Simultaneously, [[Turkeys foreign relations with Russia and the West | Turkey's growing ties to Russia]] became a concern, underscored by its decision to purchase a Russian-made anti-aircraft system, angering the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Turkey's place in the Council of Europe was questioned due to arrests and indefinite detentions of figures like a leading businessman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. The country also faced criticism for withdrawing from the Istanbul Convention protecting women's rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

## Recent Developments and Shifts

The start of the war in Ukraine brought tensions to a head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Unlike the EU and US, Ankara refused to impose sanctions on Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. While Turkey claimed to act as an intermediary, brokering deals like the export of Ukrainian grain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>, many viewed this as further proof of Erdogan's unreliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

### NATO Expansion and Sweden's Membership

A significant development occurred in May 2022 when Sweden and Finland applied to join NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. Ankara initially announced it would not accept their membership, citing their failure to tackle Kurdish terrorism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Although Erdogan eventually relented on Finland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>, he remained firm on Sweden despite anger in NATO circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

As NATO leaders prepared for the Vilnius summit, Erdogan unexpectedly linked Sweden's bid to [[Turkeys relationship with European Union and membership aspirations | Turkey's EU membership]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. While this seemed to derail Sweden's hopes, Erdogan eventually agreed to forward the application to the Turkish Parliament for ratification after a meeting with the Swedish prime minister and NATO Secretary General <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

### Reasons for the Shift

The EU would not have restarted membership talks after such "political blackmail" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. Erdogan's quick reversal is partly explained by the immediate political context: he played the nationalist card during a brutal re-election campaign but felt able to back down after securing another term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

However, the primary reason for this dramatic turnaround is Turkey's severe economic crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. The country faces a persistent budget deficit, dangerously low foreign currency reserves, and is understood to be on the brink of financial crisis due to Erdogan's opposition to using interest rates to control inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. With Gulf Arab states less willing to provide support, Erdogan appears to be seeking support from his Western partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

This push for renewed ties includes opening the way for Sweden's NATO membership, expressing support for Ukrainian membership, and handing over Ukrainian prisoners of war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. While angering [[Turkeys foreign relations with Russia and the West | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>, these moves are yielding early dividends: high-profile meetings with EU officials, a meeting with President Biden at the NATO Summit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>, and approval for the sale of F-16 fighter jets to Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. There is also hope for Western financial support if Turkey's economy enters a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

## Future of EU Accession Talks

A renewal of EU accession talks is unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. Numerous serious problems persist, including outstanding issues with neighbors and Erdogan's authoritarianism, which means Turkey does not meet the democratic requirements for membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

Furthermore, there is little appetite for Turkish membership within the European Union, either among leaders or at the popular level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. Public support for Turkish membership has steadily dropped since the mid-1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

It is also argued that Erdogan himself is not keen on EU membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. While he values the validation that comes with membership talks and the ability to argue the process remains intact, he likely doesn't want to make the changes required for full Union entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

Both sides seem to understand this delicate balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. European Council President Charles Michel suggested establishing a renewed relationship with Turkey, but "carefully avoided any mention of membership talks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

## Outlook for Turkey's Western Relations

Despite the significant steps taken at the NATO Summit, Western leaders likely do not believe this marks the beginning of a new era for [[Turkeys geopolitical strategies and alliances | Turkey's relations]] with its partners, given the damage of recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. For such a change, Ankara will need to do much more to build trust and address its political and human rights shortcomings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.

If Erdogan's recent charm offensive indicates the depth of [[Turkeys geopolitical strategies and alliances | Turkey's financial problems]], many leaders will be left wondering about the potential cost of this rediscovered friendship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.

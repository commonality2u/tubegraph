On January 11, 2024, hearings commenced at the [[role_of_the_international_court_of_justice | International Court of Justice]] (ICJ) concerning South Africa's claim that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This case has sharply divided international opinion, with many states supporting South Africa and the Palestinians, while others, particularly in the West, have dismissed the claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The proceedings at the ICJ carry significant [[impact_on_international_relations | political implications]], regardless of the final outcome.

## The South Africa vs. Israel Genocide Case

Genocide, defined as acts intended to destroy a national, ethnical, racial, or religious group in whole or in part, is considered the gravest of crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. The UN General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide on December 9, 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This Convention allows disputes related to genocide to be submitted to the [[role_of_the_international_court_of_justice | International Court of Justice]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

The ICJ, based in The Hague, is the UN's principal legal body, comprising 15 judges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. It provides advisory opinions and rules on issues brought by UN member states that accept its jurisdiction, including cases involving the Genocide Convention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Any of the 153 states that have ratified the Convention can bring a case, irrespective of direct involvement or special interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. It's crucial to note that the ICJ addresses states' responsibility, not individual criminal accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

### Background to the Case
The roots of South Africa's case stem from the conflict that began in late 2023 following Hamas's attack on Israel on October 7, which resulted in 1,200 deaths and thousands wounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. Israel's subsequent air operations and ground invasion of Gaza have reportedly killed at least 23,000 Palestinians, including over 7,000 children, and displaced nearly 2 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. A total blockade on Gaza has also led to severe humanitarian shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. The UN Secretary-General has described the situation as a humanitarian catastrophe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

### Allegations and Defense
Building on its historical support for Palestinians, South Africa initiated [[international_legal_proceedings_from_the_conflict | proceedings]] against Israel under the Genocide Convention on December 29, 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. South Africa argued that Israel's actions were intended to destroy a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial, and ethnical group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. It highlighted the high death toll and Israel's alleged "complete disregard for the civilian population," claiming this amounted to a deliberate policy of extermination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. South Africa also cited repeated statements by Israeli politicians as incitement to genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

Israel categorically rejected the [[impact_of_genocide_accusations_on_international_relations | accusations of genocide]], calling South Africa's claims "profoundly distorted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Israel maintained its invasion of Gaza was a legitimate act of self-defense following Hamas's attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. It denied incitement, stating comments were taken out of context, and blamed Hamas for civilian casualties by using civilian buildings for military purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Israel also accused Hamas of having an ideology aimed at destroying Israel and the Jewish people, arguing Hamas was the party guilty of genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

## Potential Rulings and Their Immediate Effects

The ICJ's process involves two distinct parts:

1.  **Provisional Measures**: The Court will first decide if Israeli action may contravene the Convention and could issue an order outlining steps Israel must take to halt such actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. Given the urgency, this ruling is expected within weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
2.  **Main Ruling**: The final decision on whether Israel has violated the Genocide Convention is not expected anytime soon and could take several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

### Israel's Likely Response
Should the Court order provisional measures limiting its operations in Gaza, the general view is that the Israeli government is likely to ignore them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Israel would argue it has a duty to its citizens to continue its campaign against Hamas until total victory and security are achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

## Wider Political Implications and Challenges

Even without direct enforcement powers, an ICJ ruling carries significant moral authority and could open avenues for further action at the United Nations, including resolutions in the Security Council or General Assembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

### Damage to Israel's Reputation
If the Court rules that Israel has violated the Convention, it will suffer "colossal damage to its reputation and standing on the world stage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. For a country forged by genocide (referring to the Holocaust), such a finding would be "profound" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

Israel appears to be preparing to reject any adverse ruling by questioning the Court's credibility, suggesting it would be a "politically motivated decision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

### Dilemma for Supporting Countries
The most significant challenge following an adverse ruling against Israel—whether on provisional measures or the central allegations—will fall upon countries that support Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. These [[role_of_international_actors_and_geopolitical_implications | international actors]] will face a difficult bind:
*   Condemn Israel and support measures against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   Reject the Court's decision as politically motivated, thereby undermining the legitimacy and standing of the ICJ, the UN's highest court and principal legal organ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

### Undermining International Law
At a time when international law faces "unprecedented challenge," undermining the ICJ would mark "yet another dangerous step away from the established order" that has underpinned the international system for the past 80 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

The ICJ's decision on the South Africa vs. Israel case has far-reaching [[impact_on_international_relations | implications]] not only for the parties directly involved but also for the future of international law and the global order.

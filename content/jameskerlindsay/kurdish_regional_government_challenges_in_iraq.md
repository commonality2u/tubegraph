In September 2023, the leader of the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) reportedly sent a letter to US President Biden, warning that the region was on the verge of collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This marks a disastrous turnaround for Iraqi Kurdistan, which was once seen as a key US ally and a future country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Background: A "De Facto State" in Waiting

The Kurds are often described as the world's largest nation without a state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Estimates suggest up to 35 million Kurds live across Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Armenia, with another 5 to 10 million in a diaspora in Europe, Lebanon, Russia, and elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

The possibility of a Kurdish country was offered after the First World War, but the plan was never implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. Instead, the area was divided between the new Republic of Turkey and the Kingdom of Iraq <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Despite this, the [[historical_quest_for_kurdish_independence | Kurdish quest for a homeland]] has continued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

In Turkey, the Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) waged a violent insurgency against the state since the early 1980s, initially for independence, but now reportedly for greater autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. In contrast, the Kurds in Iraq followed a different path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

### The Establishment of the Kurdish Region of Iraq (KRI)

After Iraq's defeat in the First Gulf War in 1990, the United Nations created two no-fly zones in Iraq to protect revolting communities, including the Kurds in the north <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. This security allowed the Kurds to establish an autonomous territory, known as the Kurdish Region of Iraq (KRI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. The KRI carved out what became a de facto state with many features of a country, including democratic government institutions and diplomatic activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

However, after the 2003 US invasion of Iraq and the ousting of Saddam Hussein, the preference was for the Kurdish region to remain part of Iraq, albeit with considerable autonomy within a new federal system established in 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. Despite this, an informal regional referendum in 2005 showed almost complete support for statehood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

## The 2017 Independence Referendum

The KRG continued preparations for independence, and in July 2014, the Region's president announced plans for a vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. This was temporarily shelved due to an attack by the Islamic State, but efforts resumed after ISIS was forced from the area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

In June 2017, the KRG announced that a [[2017_kurdish_independence_referendum | referendum]] would be held that September <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

### Widespread Opposition and International Concerns

The announcement immediately led to an outcry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>:
*   The Iraqi central government expressed vehement opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   Turkey, Iran, and Syria all opposed any Kurdish attempts to break away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.
*   Close allies like the United States and Britain expressed concerns, stating that the time wasn't right for a vote and that the focus should remain on defeating ISIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   Israel was the only significant international actor to support the plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

### Referendum Results and Aftermath

Despite the objections, the vote went ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. With a turnout of over 70%, 3 million people participated, and 93% (2.8 million) favored independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

However, hopes for statehood were short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>:
*   **Iraqi Government Response**: Baghdad isolated the region, suspending international flights to and from the KRI and taking control of border crossings with Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. More significantly, Iraqi forces seized disputed territory, including the oil-rich region of Kirkuk, which had been captured by Kurdish forces from ISIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   **Neighboring States**: [[iran_and_iraq_pressures_on_kurdistan | Iran]] and Turkey threatened sanctions and other punitive measures if the Kurdish authorities proceeded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
*   **Allies' Stance**: Key allies clarified their opposition. Washington announced it did not recognize the results of the votes and would not recognize an Iraqi Kurdish State created by unilateral declaration of independence, a position shared by other Security Council members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

Faced with overwhelming opposition, the KRG had no choice but to back down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Within weeks, the referendum results were frozen, and two months later, the Iraqi Supreme Court ruled that secession was illegal and annulled the referendum â€“ a decision unchallenged by Kurdish authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

## Current Challenges to the Kurdish Regional Government

Iraqi Kurdistan is currently facing significant threats that its leadership claims could lead to its collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

### Pressure from the Iraqi Central Government

The KRG has come under increasing pressure from Baghdad, particularly over energy disputes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.
*   After taking control of Kirkuk in March 2023, Baghdad won a critical case at the International Court of Arbitration, alleging that Kurdish oil exports via Turkey were illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   This victory immediately halted a lucrative trade of 450,000 barrels of oil per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
*   With oil revenues collapsed, the KRG is struggling to pay its regional officials and administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

### Pressure from Iran

[[iran_and_iraq_pressures_on_kurdistan | Iran]] has faced a growing Kurdish separatist threat of its own and argues that these militant groups are taking refuge in Iraqi Kurdistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. Tehran has pressured both the Iraqi central government and the KRG to disarm "terrorist secessionist groups," leading to increasing incursions into the KRI by Iranian-backed Shiite militias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

### Internal Divisions

Matters are complicated by entrenched [[internal_divisions_within_iraqi_kurdistan | divisions within the Kurdish population in Iraq]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   The **Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP)** controls the presidency and government, and is the largest party in the Kurdish Parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
*   Its main rival is the **Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK)**, which has traditionally held the Iraqi Federal presidency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   As long-standing rivals, the PUK has increasingly turned to Iraq's Arab community and to Tehran for support, extending Baghdad and Tehran's political and strategic reach into the Kurdish area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

### Other Destabilizing Factors

Other factors also destabilize the region, including concerns about widespread corruption and reports of a declining human rights situation, which is particularly worrying given that Iraqi Kurdistan was long considered more democratic and open than its neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

## Plea for US Assistance

The KRG's alleged plea for help to the United States reflects this increasing instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. Prime Minister Masrour Barzani reportedly painted a stark picture, claiming the region was "bleeding economically and haemorrhaging politically," and that the crisis could lead to the collapse of Kurdistan and even the Iraqi federal system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

However, observers have doubts about the impact of US assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>:
*   While the United States maintains an interest in the region, providing aid, supporting Kurdish militia forces, and maintaining a diplomatic presence in Erbil, many feel it is not as engaged as it could be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
*   Its power to act has deteriorated since its formal withdrawal from Iraq in 2011, leading to a steady wane in Washington's influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.
*   Neighboring [[iran_and_iraq_pressures_on_kurdistan | Iran]] has become a much more prevalent actor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.
*   Many argue Washington is more focused on other issues, such as the war in Ukraine and concerns about Chinese military action against Taiwan, limiting its political capability and diplomatic bandwidth to act in Iraqi Kurdistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

## Conclusion

While the KRI has shown remarkable resilience over the years, often with essential outside support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>, Iraqi Kurdistan, long seen as a possible candidate for future statehood, is now far weaker than it was just a few years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. Under threat from Baghdad and Tehran, and plagued by [[internal_divisions_within_iraqi_kurdistan | internal divisions]], its days as a "country-in-waiting" may now be over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.

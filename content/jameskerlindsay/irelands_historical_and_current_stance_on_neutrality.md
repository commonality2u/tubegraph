Historically, Ireland has maintained a firm principle of neutrality, choosing to steer clear of [[debate_on_ireland_joining_nato_amidst_geopolitical_changes | NATO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. However, recent geopolitical changes, particularly the [[impact_of_the_ukraine_war_on_irelands_foreign_policy | Ukraine war]], have prompted a reassessment of this long-standing position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This has led to a significant public debate regarding whether Ireland should abandon its neutrality and potentially embrace [[debate_on_ireland_joining_nato_amidst_geopolitical_changes | NATO integration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Historical Foundations of Irish Neutrality

For most of its existence, Ireland has upheld an official policy of [[arguments_for_and_against_irelands_military_neutrality | military neutrality]], which many consider an integral part of the national identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

### Early Efforts to Distance from Britain
After its establishment as the [[history_of_irelands_partition_and_conflict | Irish Free State]], Ireland sought to distance itself from Britain and limit its involvement in [[arguments_for_and_against_irelands_military_neutrality | foreign conflicts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. The constitution guaranteed that Ireland could not join wars without parliamentary approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. When Ireland became a republic in 1937, its new constitution emphasized cooperation between states and the peaceful settlement of disputes in line with international law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

### Formal Proclamation during WWII
The formal principle of [[arguments_for_and_against_irelands_military_neutrality | neutrality]] was officially proclaimed at the start of the Second World War, when Ireland [[arguments_for_and_against_irelands_military_neutrality | refused to join the Allied battle]] against Nazi Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. While this remains a controversial decision, historians note Ireland's inclination towards the Allies, sharing vital intelligence and cracking down on anti-British activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Additionally, approximately 50,000 Irish citizens joined the British armed forces, and tens of thousands more contributed to the wider British war effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

### Cold War and NATO Refusal
Following WWII and the onset of the Cold War, Ireland was invited to join the newly established North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. However, the Irish government refused, deeming a formal military alliance with the United Kingdom, which still occupied a part of its constitutionally claimed territory, unacceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Consequently, Ireland retained its neutrality more out of political realities than ideological conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Notably, unlike many other neutral countries, neutrality has never been formally written into the Irish Constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

### Role in International Peacekeeping
Despite remaining outside the Western Alliance, Ireland cultivated a valuable reputation on the international stage, particularly as a contributor to [[irelands_participation_in_international_security_and_peacekeeping | UN peacekeeping missions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Over 60 years, the Irish Defence Forces have deployed troops to numerous international hotspots, including the Congo, Cyprus, and Lebanon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

## Shifting Context and Modern Debates

### Post-Cold War Developments
By the 1990s, the context of Irish neutrality had changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Relations with the UK improved significantly after Ireland joined the European Communities (now the EU) in 1973 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. The landmark 1998 [[history_of_irelands_partition_and_conflict | Good Friday Agreement]] further transformed Anglo-Irish relations and opened the way for potential [[challenges_and_considerations_for_a_potential_united_ireland | Irish unification]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Following the end of the Cold War, Ireland joined NATO's Partnership for Peace program in 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. Despite these changes, neutrality remained deeply embedded in Irish thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. In 2009, when the EU signed the Lisbon Treaty envisioning closer defence cooperation, Ireland insisted on a protocol specifically reaffirming that the treaty did not affect its traditional [[arguments_for_and_against_irelands_military_neutrality | military neutrality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

### Impact of the Ukraine War
The [[impact_of_the_ukraine_war_on_irelands_foreign_policy | war in Ukraine]] has significantly challenged Ireland's stance on neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. Ireland has openly and unequivocally supported Ukraine, emphasizing that military neutrality does not equate to political neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Dublin has condemned Russia's invasion, supported EU sanctions, and voted to expel Russia from the Council of Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Ireland has also provided Ukraine with â‚¬55 million in non-lethal military aid and agreed to train Ukrainian forces in another EU member state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Many argue these actions have pushed the boundaries of military neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

Growing Russian naval activity near Irish waters has also highlighted Ireland's strategic importance due to vital undersea communications cables running to North America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. With fears of potential attacks on these cables, the Irish government is reportedly considering joining a NATO project to protect critical infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. This has led to calls for Ireland to formally abandon its neutrality and join [[debate_on_ireland_joining_nato_amidst_geopolitical_changes | NATO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. The government has signaled an openness to change by rejecting a proposal to codify neutrality into the constitution and initiating a public consultation on the country's defence orientation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

## Arguments for and Against Neutrality

### Arguments for Maintaining Neutrality
*   **Existential Identity:** Neutrality is seen as a fundamental part of Irish identity, defining its role on the world stage, especially as a UN peacekeeper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   **Pragmatism:** Proponents argue there is no external pressure to abandon neutrality, and Ireland is effectively protected by NATO anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
*   **Cost:** Ireland has one of the lowest defence expenditures in the EU (0.3% of GDP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. Joining NATO would require a significant increase to the expected 2% of GDP, which is viewed by some as an unacceptable diversion of spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
*   **Partition Argument:** Many feel it is still inconceivable for Ireland to formally ally with a country (the UK) that occupies what they consider Irish territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

### Arguments for Abandoning Neutrality / Joining NATO
*   **"Freeloading" Criticism:** Critics argue Ireland benefits from a broader European defence umbrella without contributing adequately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.
*   **Inevitable Defence Spending Increase:** Regardless of its neutral stance, there's a growing sense that Ireland will need to increase defence spending, with the government already announcing the largest increase in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   **Challenged Partition Argument:** The long-standing argument against alliance with the UK has been challenged by a recent revelation of a secret 1950s agreement where Britain provided Ireland with air security for 70 years, a report the Irish government neither confirms nor denies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. Furthermore, Ireland would be guaranteed defence from Britain, the EU, and the United States in the event of an attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

## Future Outlook
The question of whether Ireland will abandon neutrality and seek [[debate_on_ireland_joining_nato_amidst_geopolitical_changes | NATO membership]] remains uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. Polling data is mixed; while one poll showed 70% support for sanctions on Russia, two-thirds wanted to keep neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. Another poll showed a more even split, with 52% favoring joining NATO versus 48% against <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. A referendum on the issue, which would almost certainly require a popular vote, could go either way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

Even if full NATO membership is deemed too far, other options exist. Closer cooperation with NATO, short of full membership, could be an acceptable alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. Another possibility is for Ireland to abandon formal neutrality and become more integrated into European Union defence structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. The current discussions in Ireland highlight how the [[impact_of_the_ukraine_war_on_irelands_foreign_policy | Ukraine war]] has profoundly affected European and International Security debates, forcing many countries to rethink long-held views about their place in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

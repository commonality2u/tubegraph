In December 2023, Turkish President [[Recep Tayyip Erdogan]] paid a high-profile visit to neighbouring Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This trip was widely hailed as a pivotal moment in bilateral relations, following years of tension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Despite an improved mood between Athens and Ankara, questions remain about the visit's lasting impact and its ability to settle long-standing disputes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## A Cyclical Relationship

The relationship between Greece and Turkey exemplifies a complex pattern in international politics: periods of positive relations interspersed with tensions or outright hostility, often in a cyclical pattern of confrontation and rapprochement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Building on a long and intricate history over the past century, [[Turkey Greece Relations]] have fluctuated between good working ties and extreme tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. The fundamental approach of each country to the other is shaped by perceptions of the past, even when disputes are based on modern political and legal differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

Previous efforts to transform relations have often stalled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Notably, in 1999, a major crisis erupted when Kurdish Workers Party leader Abdullah Öcalan was arrested leaving the Greek Embassy in Kenya, an event seen as a fundamental betrayal by Ankara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[10:13]</a>. However, just months later, two major earthquakes hit both countries, sparking a dramatic period of rapprochement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[10:41]</a>. This led to Greece lifting its long-standing veto on Turkey's European Union membership candidacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[10:51]</a>.

When [[Erdogans rise to power and political career | Recep Tayyip Erdogan]] emerged as a new Turkish leader in late 2002, he initially stressed his commitment to Turkey's EU membership and prioritized relations with Greece and resolving the Cyprus issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[11:29]</a>. However, the upbeat mood began to wear off by the end of the decade, as outstanding issues remained unresolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[11:55]</a>. As [[Erdogans administration and changing political outlook | Erdogan]] became more authoritarian and increasingly estranged from the West, [[Turkey Greece Relations]] deteriorated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[12:16]</a>. This was evident during the 2015 migrant crisis, when Ankara allowed over a million migrants to cross the Aegean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[12:28]</a>.

A 2017 visit by [[Erdogans administration and changing political outlook | Erdogan]] to Greece – the first Turkish presidential visit in 65 years – was a disaster when he called for the Treaty of Lausanne to be modernized, an idea immediately rejected by the Greek president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[12:40]</a>. Tensions further escalated due to Turkey's vocal territorial claims in the wider Mediterranean, fueled by energy finds, and a sharp increase in incursions by Turkish military aircraft over the Aegean islands in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[13:06]</a>.

## The December 2023 Visit

As Greece and Turkey marked the centenary of the Treaty of Lausanne in 2023, circumstances once again appeared to be changing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[13:42]</a>. A devastating earthquake in Turkey drove rapprochement, with Greece quickly sending emergency rescue teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[13:50]</a>. Additionally, [[Erdogans policies and influence | Erdogan]], having won re-election and facing growing economic problems at home, seemed to decide to mend relations with Western partners, including Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[13:58]</a>.

It was against this backdrop that [[Erdogans Visit to Greece]] on December 7, 2023, was hailed as a new start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[14:10]</a>. During the visit:
*   [[Recep Tayyip Erdogan]] called for the Aegean to become a "sea of peace" and stated that no problem was unsolvable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[14:19]</a>.
*   He and Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis signed 15 bilateral agreements covering areas from energy to agriculture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[14:19]</a>.
*   They also agreed on a non-binding 10-point declaration of friendly relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[14:34]</a>. This declaration included commitments to:
    *   Political dialogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[14:41]</a>
    *   Confidence-building measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[14:41]</a>
    *   A joint action plan for cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[14:45]</a>
    *   A commitment to resolve disputes amicably through direct consultations or other UN Charter provisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[14:45]</a>

## Outlook

While the agreements and declarations are welcome, there is a sense of déjà vu, as Greece and Turkey have been in this position many times before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[14:58]</a>. Without settling the outstanding bilateral issues, including the long-standing Cyprus dispute, any new attempt at a fresh start, however welcome, is likely to last only until the next crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[15:08]</a>. This latest development is suspected to be merely the most recent phase in the long-standing cycle of ups and downs between these two Mediterranean neighbours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[15:21]</a>.

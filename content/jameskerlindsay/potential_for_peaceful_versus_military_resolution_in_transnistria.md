In March 2024, authorities in the Moldovan breakaway region of [[Transnistria and its geopolitical significance | Transnistria]] appealed to Russia for assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This occurred amidst speculation that Moldova might utilize the ongoing war in Ukraine to reclaim control of the territory, which has been under [[russian_influence_and_military_presence_in_transnistria | Russia's protection]] for over 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Moscow has publicly cautioned that any use of force would be considered a direct attack on Russia itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## International Approaches to De Facto States

In modern international relations, the prevailing view is that de facto states should be peacefully reintegrated through negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. However, these talks can be lengthy and unfruitful, leading to a "frozen conflict" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Some countries, therefore, choose to retake such territories by force, especially when changing circumstances make it feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. A recent example is Azerbaijan's successful military campaign to retake Nagorno-Karabakh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

The situation between Moldova and the [[russian_influence_and_military_presence_in_transnistria | Russian-backed]] breakaway region of [[Transnistria and its geopolitical significance | Transnistria]] is a current debate concerning these two approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Moldova's Stance and Assertiveness

Moldova has been committed to a peaceful resolution of the dispute for over 30 years, though this approach has not yielded a breakthrough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. With [[impact_of_the_ukraine_war_on_transnistria | Russia engaged in Ukraine]], some have suggested that now might be the opportune moment to retake the territory by force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

Following the [[impact_of_the_ukraine_war_on_transnistria | war in Ukraine]], Moldova, under its pro-European president Maia Sandu, took steps to align with the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. While joining NATO was considered, Moldova focused on EU membership, applying in March 2022 and beginning formal membership talks in December 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

The strategic shift in Ukraine, specifically the reduced prospect of [[russian_influence_and_military_presence_in_transnistria | Russian forces]] linking up with their garrison in [[Transnistria and its geopolitical significance | Transnistria]], has led to increased focus on the possibility of a Moldovan attempt to retake the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Moldova's government has dismissed the idea of Russian retaliation, arguing that Russia's military options are limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

Moldova has become more assertive due to Russia being cut off from [[Transnistria and its geopolitical significance | Transnistria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. This includes Ukraine closing its border with [[Transnistria and its geopolitical significance | Transnistria]], significantly reducing trade, and Moldova introducing tariffs on goods entering the region from its side, which Transnistrian leaders termed an "economic blockade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

## Transnistria's Response

In response to these pressures, [[MoldovaTransnistria relations | Transnistrian authorities]] convened a "Congress of Deputies at all Levels" at the end of February 2024, the first such meeting in 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. While the Congress appealed to Moscow for help, it notably refrained from formally requesting annexation, which many observers had anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

## Arguments Against Military Resolution

Despite calls for retaking the territory by force, military action by Moldova is considered highly improbable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

*   **Moldova's Consistent Stance:** Moldova has always maintained its desire for a peaceful resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. There is no deep ethnic hostility between the sides, unlike in other separatist conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
*   **Military Incapacity:** Moldova's armed forces are small and comparatively weak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. While defense spending and modernization plans are increasing, there is no indication of readiness for an invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
*   **Uncertainty of Success:** Even if an invasion were attempted, success is not guaranteed. Although the [[russian_influence_and_military_presence_in_transnistria | Russian military garrison]] in [[Transnistria and its geopolitical significance | Transnistria]] is small and isolated, Transnistrians might resist a forcible attack, and [[Transnistria and its geopolitical significance | Transnistria]] is reportedly increasing its security forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.
*   **External Non-Intervention:** Outside forces, such as NATO, might avoid sending combat troops to Moldova, similar to their approach in Ukraine, though NATO member Romania might act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.
*   **Political Risks:** Forcible integration could paradoxically strengthen pro-Russian sentiment within Moldova, potentially increasing Moscow's influence rather than diminishing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

## Arguments for Peaceful Resolution

A peaceful, organic reunification is increasingly seen as a more viable and beneficial path for Moldova <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

*   **Waning Russian Influence:** There are indications that [[russian_influence_and_military_presence_in_transnistria | Moscow's influence]] may be declining in [[Transnistria and its geopolitical significance | Transnistria]], evidenced by lower voter turnout in the recent Russian presidential election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
*   **Increased European Integration:** [[Transnistria and its geopolitical significance | Transnistria]] is slowly shifting towards Europe, with trade with the European Union significantly increasing to around 70% of its imports and exports, as Russia is cut off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.

For these reasons, allowing the situation to remain as it is, at least for now, might be more advantageous for Moldova than pursuing a potentially costly conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.

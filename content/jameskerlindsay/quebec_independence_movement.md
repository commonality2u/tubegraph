For decades, international attention has been focused on the French-speaking province of [[Cultural and linguistic identity in Quebec | Quebec]], which has long had a strong pro-independence movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Discussions have centered on whether [[Cultural and linguistic identity in Quebec | Quebec]], the predominantly French-speaking province, would break away and form a separate country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>.

## Historical Background
Canada, at 10 million km² or 3.8 million square miles, is the world's second-largest country by area, with a population of around 40 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:28">[01:28:28]</a>. It operates under a federal political system, divided into 10 provinces and three territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:39">[01:39:39]</a>.

The history of European exploration in Canada began in the late 15th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:12">[02:12:12]</a>. Over subsequent centuries, Britain and France established extensive colonies in North America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:23">[02:23:23]</a>. After the Seven Years' War in 1763, French territories east of the Mississippi River came under British control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:29">[02:29:29]</a>.

In 1791, much of the remaining British-held North American territory was divided into two parts: the predominantly French-speaking Lower Canada (known as [[Cultural and linguistic identity in Quebec | Quebec]]) and the English-speaking Upper Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:39">[02:39:39]</a>. Following a francophone rebellion, these two territories were merged in 1840 to form the single Province of Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:55">[02:55:55]</a>. This lasted until 1867, when Canada (including present-day Ontario and [[Cultural and linguistic identity in Quebec | Quebec]]) united with Nova Scotia and New Brunswick to form the Dominion of Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:04">[03:04:04]</a>.

## Resurgence of the Movement (1970s-1990s)
By the 1970s, pressures for independence began to emerge in [[Cultural and linguistic identity in Quebec | Quebec]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:12">[04:12:12]</a>. A resurgence of francophone identity coincided with calls for modernization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:18">[04:18:18]</a>. While provincial authorities pushed for greater self-rule and the central government tried to strengthen Canadian national unity by making French an official language, calls for independence grew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:26">[04:26:26]</a>.

This movement gained wider attention in 1976 when the pro-independence Parti Québécois won elections in the territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:38">[04:38:38]</a>.

### Referendums
*   **1980 Referendum:** The Parti Québécois organized a referendum on a sovereignty-association model, proposing [[Cultural and linguistic identity in Quebec | Quebec]] formally separate from Canada while retaining close economic ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:46">[04:46:46]</a>. The idea was defeated, with 60% voting against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:59">[04:59:59]</a>.
*   **[[Impact of the 1995 referendum on Quebecs independence | 1995 Referendum]]:** After returning to power in 1994, the Parti Québécois held another referendum the following year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:06">[05:06:06]</a>. The plan for independence was narrowly defeated, losing by just 50.6% to 49.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:13">[05:13:13]</a>.

## Legal and Political Developments
The [[Impact of the 1995 referendum on Quebecs independence | 1995 referendum]] was a watershed moment for Canada, prompting crucial legal and political developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:23">[05:23:23]</a>.

### Supreme Court Ruling
Following a request from the Canadian government, the Canadian Supreme Court ruled in 1998 that while [[Cultural and linguistic identity in Quebec | Quebec]] couldn't unilaterally secede under Canadian or international law, a clear vote in favor of secession would require all parties to negotiate in good faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:31">[05:31:31]</a>.

### Clarity Act
This ruling led to the passing of the Clarity Act in 2000, which established the terms for any future independence process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:49">[05:49:49]</a>. Key provisions included:
*   Any referendum must pose a clear question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:59">[05:59:59]</a>.
*   All provinces and Indigenous peoples must be involved in any subsequent negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:06">[06:06:06]</a>.
*   A formal constitutional amendment would be necessary for any secession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:11">[06:11:11]</a>.

Although [[Cultural and linguistic identity in Quebec | Quebec]] refused to accept the law, the Clarity Act is now viewed as providing a framework for any future secession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:18">[06:18:18]</a>.

## Contemporary Status
Since the Clarity Act, the situation has evolved considerably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:28">[06:28:28]</a>. While the campaign for [[Cultural and linguistic identity in Quebec | Quebec]] independence still has a solid base, broader support in the province has declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:32">[06:32:32]</a>. Latest polling suggests that around 30% to 40% of Quebecers support breaking away and establishing a separate independent state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:39">[06:39:39]</a>.

### Future Implications
If other provinces, such as [[alberta_separatist_sentiment | Alberta]] or Saskatchewan, were to break away, [[Cultural and linguistic identity in Quebec | Quebec]] might also begin a new push to break away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:45:45">[14:45:45]</a>. Debates currently taking place in [[alberta_separatist_sentiment | Alberta]] may have significant implications for the future of Canada, including potentially reigniting the [[History of Quebecs independence movement | Quebec independence movement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:49:49">[14:49:49]</a>.

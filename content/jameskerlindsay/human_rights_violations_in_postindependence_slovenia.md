In 2021, marking the thirtieth anniversary of [[yugoslavias_breakup_and_slovenias_independence | Slovenia's declaration of independence]] from [[yugoslavias_breakup_and_slovenias_independence | Yugoslavia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, a significant human rights violation came to light. While [[yugoslavias_breakup_and_slovenias_independence | Slovenia]] largely avoided the brutal violence seen elsewhere in the collapsing federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, it became the focus of an act where tens of thousands of Yugoslav citizens living within its borders were deliberately "erased" from official records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Background: Slovenia's Independence and the Question of Citizenship

The dissolution of [[yugoslavias_breakup_and_slovenias_independence | Yugoslavia]] in the early 1990s presented complex challenges, particularly regarding the status of citizens from one part of a political union living in a part that was breaking away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. While some processes resulted in [[ethnic_cleansing_allegations_in_the_yugoslav_wars | violence and ethnic cleansing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, even relatively peaceful transitions could lead to serious issues, with former full members of society suddenly regarded as unwanted foreigners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

### The History of Slovenia in Yugoslavia
Historically, the territory of [[yugoslavias_breakup_and_slovenias_independence | Slovenia]] was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Following World War I, it joined the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, later renamed the Kingdom of [[yugoslavias_breakup_and_slovenias_independence | Yugoslavia]] in 1929 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. After World War II, it became the Socialist Federal Republic of [[yugoslavias_breakup_and_slovenias_independence | Yugoslavia]], a union of six republics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

As the most economically advanced part of the federation, [[yugoslavias_breakup_and_slovenias_independence | Slovenia]] attracted economic migrants, particularly from Croatia and Bosnia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Approximately 200,000 such individuals eventually settled in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

### Road to Independence
After the death of Josip Broz Tito in 1980 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>, [[yugoslavias_breakup_and_slovenias_independence | Yugoslavia]] began a process of state collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. In December 1990, [[yugoslavias_breakup_and_slovenias_independence | Slovenia]] held an independence referendum, with 96% voting to break away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. [[yugoslavias_breakup_and_slovenias_independence | Slovenia]] declared independence on June 25, 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Although the federal government attempted to suppress the secession, a ceasefire was agreed within days, allowing [[yugoslavias_breakup_and_slovenias_independence | Slovenia]] to pursue its independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

## The Act of Erasure

As part of its state-building process, [[yugoslavias_breakup_and_slovenias_independence | Slovenia]] passed legislation requiring all Yugoslav citizens residing in the country to apply for Slovenian citizenship by December 26, 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. While 170,000 people applied, tens of thousands failed to meet this deadline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Many did not grasp the significance of the deadline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, while some had their applications rejected, particularly those who had been part of the Yugoslav Army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

In February 1992, less than two months after the deadline, the Slovenian government ordered that those who had not applied for citizenship be deleted from the list of permanent residents and registered as foreigners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. All Slovenian documents held by these individuals, such as identity cards or driver's licenses, were annulled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Reports detailed people witnessing their documents being shredded when attempting to apply for residency or renew paperwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. In total, 25,671 people, roughly one percent of the country's population, were affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

## Catastrophic Consequences for "The Erased"

The results for those affected, now widely known as "the erased," were catastrophic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>:
*   **Loss of Services** Many were suddenly deprived of access to state services, including pensions, state housing, healthcare, and other social rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Unemployment and Poverty** Many lost their jobs and, without proof of the right to work, found it impossible to secure new employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Families were reduced to poverty, lacking unemployment benefits or other state aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
*   **Denied Education** Children were even denied access to education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   **Statelessness and Deportation** In severe cases, individuals born in [[yugoslavias_breakup_and_slovenias_independence | Slovenia]] but not registered elsewhere in the Federation effectively became stateless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Many were forced to leave the country, either returning to war-torn [[yugoslavias_breakup_and_slovenias_independence | Yugoslavia]] or emigrating elsewhere in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>, while others were simply deported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

## Legal and Political Battles

For years, the Slovenian Government showed little interest in addressing the issue, which affected a largely marginalized part of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

### Slovenian Constitutional Court Rulings
In 1999, the issue was brought before the Slovenian Constitutional Court, which ruled the decision to delete records unlawful and ordered the government to address it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. The government responded with new legislation allowing a three-month window for applications, but critically, it did not address the problems faced by the erased over the previous decade or allow expelled individuals to return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

Four years later, in 2003, the Constitutional Court issued another ruling stating that the rights of those affected should apply from the point their records were deleted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Despite this, the government continued to refuse retrospective measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>, meaning no compensation for suffering, hardship, or legal costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

### Public Sentiment and Politicization
The issue became increasingly politicized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. In a country trying to disassociate itself from its Yugoslav past, many ordinary Slovenes had little sympathy for the "erased," viewing them as foreign economic migrants who should have complied with the law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. Some even portrayed them as enemies of the state who tried to deny independent [[yugoslavias_breakup_and_slovenias_independence | Slovenia]]'s existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. This sentiment was underscored in an April 2004 referendum, where 94% voted against returning rights to the erased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

### International Pressure and European Court of Human Rights
On May 1, 2004, [[yugoslavias_breakup_and_slovenias_independence | Slovenia]] joined the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. This brought increased pressure from human rights organizations and international bodies, including the United Nations and the Council of Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

In 2006, eleven of the Erased brought their case before the European Court of Human Rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. Four years later, the Court ruled in their favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. After a challenge by the Slovenian Government, the Grand Chamber of the Court confirmed in 2012 that [[yugoslavias_breakup_and_slovenias_independence | Slovenia]] had violated Articles 8, 13, and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantee respect for private and family life, the right to an effective remedy, and the prohibition of discrimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. [[yugoslavias_breakup_and_slovenias_independence | Slovenia]] was given one year to establish a compensation scheme, but failed to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. Consequently, in 2014, the Court ordered the government to pay nearly a quarter of a million euros in compensation to the applicants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

## Resolution and Ongoing Fight for Justice

Facing a massive wave of potential cases, the Slovenian Government finally complied with the rulings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. It committed to ending human rights violations and established a compensation scheme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. By February 2016, this scheme had paid out 22 million euros to approximately 5,300 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. On May 25, 2016, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe declared itself satisfied with Slovenia's measures, considering the matter closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

However, despite these rulings, the fight for justice continues for many of the erased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. Some remain ineligible for the scheme or cannot afford the legal fees to file a claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. Even three decades after the events, many of "The Erased" are still fighting for justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

The case of the erased in [[yugoslavias_breakup_and_slovenias_independence | Slovenia]] offers a complex insight into the human rights issues that can arise during state dissolution, even in the absence of the brutal [[ethnic_cleansing_allegations_in_the_yugoslav_wars | genocides and ethnic cleansings]] seen elsewhere in [[yugoslavias_breakup_and_slovenias_independence | Yugoslavia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. The situation highlights how successive governments initially refused to tackle serious human rights violations, only acting when faced with significant financial penalties from international court rulings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

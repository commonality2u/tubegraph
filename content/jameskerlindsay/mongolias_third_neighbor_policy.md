## Introduction

[[Mongolias foreign policy and international relations | Mongolia's Third Neighbor Policy]] refers to its strategy of cultivating ties with countries beyond its immediate neighbors, Russia and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>. This approach aims to protect Mongolia's economic, political, diplomatic, and strategic autonomy while maintaining close relationships with Moscow and Beijing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>. Over 2023 and 2024, Mongolia has gained increasing attention from Washington and key European capitals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, prompting questions about its geopolitical alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Geopolitical Context and Historical Background

Mongolia is an intriguing example of a "pivot state" in international relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. Pivot states are countries whose foreign policy decisions can have profound effects due to factors like their location, economic resources, or broader influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. They can alter regional power balances by aligning, become buffers by remaining neutral, or act as vital elements of foreign power projection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.

Mongolia is the world's 18th largest country, covering approximately 1.56 million square kilometers, and is landlocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. It shares its northern border with Russia and its southern, eastern, and western borders with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. With a population of about 3.4 million, it is one of the most sparsely inhabited countries globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. The country is a significant source of coal, copper, gold, tin, and tungsten, with mining accounting for roughly a quarter of its GDP and 90% of its exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.

[[Mongolias historical ties with Russia and China | Mongolia's historical ties with Russia and China]] are complex and long-standing. After being placed under Chinese control by a 1727 treaty between China and Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>, it gained independence in 1911 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>, with support from the newly formed Soviet Union in 1921 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. In 1924, the Mongolian People's Republic was proclaimed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>. Despite the USSR's initial refusal to recognize it as separate from China, Mongolia gradually became a Soviet puppet state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>. This culminated in a mutual assistance protocol in 1936, leading to Soviet troop deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.

After the Soviet Union recognized Mongolia's independence in 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a> and China accepted its statehood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>, Mongolia remained a close ally of Moscow throughout the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>. This close relationship profoundly affected Mongolia's external relations, leading to a collapse in ties with China following the Sino-Soviet split in the late 1950s and early 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>. Soviet troops were again stationed in Mongolia in 1966 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>, and Russian became widely spoken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>.

## Evolution of the Third Neighbor Policy

The end of the Cold War and the collapse of the USSR profoundly impacted Mongolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>. The loss of its benefactor and a collapse in trade led to a severe economic downturn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>. Relations with the new Russian Federation soured when Moscow halted technical assistance and demanded repayment of aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>.

This forced Mongolia to build new international ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>. The United States, with whom diplomatic relations were established in 1987 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>, became a key target, as did the European Union, leading to a partnership agreement in 1993 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>. Other important relationships were forged with countries like Japan and South Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>.

Crucially, relations with China rapidly improved despite their tense history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>. A Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation was signed in 1994 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>, leading to a massive expansion of trade and investment, particularly in the mining sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>. Within a decade, China became Mongolia's most significant economic partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>.

Political and strategic ties with Russia also dramatically improved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>. Many Mongolians continued to view Russia positively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>. After settling the debt issue in 2004, cooperation strengthened, culminating in a Treaty of Friendship and a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>.

However, fears grew that Mongolia was becoming overly reliant on Russia and China, especially China, due to its rapidly expanding global influence and the perceived control of Chinese firms over critical sectors like mining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>. As a result, Mongolia began to strengthen its "Third Neighbor Policy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>, steadily deepening ties with many other countries, including key Western states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>.

## Deepening Western Ties

Under its Third Neighbor Policy, Mongolia built wide-ranging cooperation with the United States, leading to a strategic partnership in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:00">[09:59:00]</a>. It also extended its relationship with the EU and other partners, including Japan, India, and Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>.

The [[Impact of the Ukraine war on Mongolias diplomatic stance | Ukraine war]] significantly altered this comfortable position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>. Initially, Mongolia adopted a cautious, neutral approach, abstaining from key UN votes condemning the invasion due to fears of undermining relations with Moscow and the implications of sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>. However, as the war progressed, subtle but noticeable changes emerged, including a call for peace by Mongolia's president in late 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a>.

The most significant development has been the steady increase in contacts with Western countries since early 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>. This includes ongoing high-level contacts with the United States and growing interest from European countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>:
*   In May 2023, Emmanuel Macron became the first French president to visit Mongolia, explicitly aiming to loosen Russia's control over its neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>.
*   In February 2024, Germany became the first EU member to sign a strategic partnership with Mongolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>.
*   In April 2024, the British Foreign Secretary visited Mongolia, laying foundations for a future partnership agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:56:00">[11:56:00]</a>.

Reasons for this increased Western attention include the disastrous effect of the Ukraine war on the Mongolian economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>, and potential internal divisions within Mongolia, where younger generations increasingly prefer the West over Russia and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:00">[12:24:00]</a>. There is also growing nervousness in Mongolia about the increasingly close ties between Beijing and Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:37:00">[12:37:00]</a>, as being "squeezed between them" is different from pivoting between two separate powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>.

## [[Mongolias economic and strategic significance to the West | Economic and Strategic Drivers]]

For Western states, this engagement offers several benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>. Besides the chance to weaken one of Moscow's closest historical partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:00">[13:01:00]</a>, they are keen to gain greater access to Mongolia's valuable mining sector, a point often highlighted in official statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05:00">[13:05:00]</a>.

## Current Stance and Future Outlook

Mongolia is not shifting decisively away from Russia and China towards the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:20:00">[13:20:00]</a>. Its geography makes abandoning its close ties to its two large neighbors unfeasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:27:00">[13:27:00]</a>. Any concerted effort to align with the West could lead to disastrous consequences if Beijing and Moscow were to align to isolate Mongolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:35:00">[13:35:00]</a>.

Instead, Mongolia is pursuing a foreign policy designed to protect its economic, political, diplomatic, and strategic autonomy while maintaining close ties with Moscow and Beijing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:00">[13:46:00]</a>. It is not pivoting *towards* the West; rather, as its two neighbors grow closer, it is pivoting *towards* its third neighbor: the rest of the world, including the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a>.

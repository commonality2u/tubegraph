In recent months, the [[pakistani_taliban_attacks_and_security_challenges | Pakistani Taliban]] has staged a series of high-profile attacks, raising fears that the group is re-emerging as a significant challenge to Pakistan's peace and security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This situation has also brought forth questions about the [[relationship_between_pakistan_and_the_taliban_regime_in_afghanistan | relationship between Pakistan and the Taliban regime in neighbouring Afghanistan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Geographical and Ethnic Landscape

[[Pakistans geopolitical relations with Afghanistan India Iran and China | Pakistan]] and [[Pakistans geopolitical relations with Afghanistan India Iran and China | Afghanistan]] are located in South Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Pakistan spans approximately 880,000 square kilometres (340,000 square miles), making it the 33rd largest UN member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Afghanistan, to its Northwest, covers about 650,000 square kilometres (250,000 square miles), ranking as the 40th largest UN member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. While similar in size, their populations differ significantly: Afghanistan has around 40 million inhabitants, whereas Pakistan's population is estimated at 230 million, making it the fifth largest in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

Both countries are predominantly Sunni Muslim but are ethnically diverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. A key ethnic group in the region are the [[role_of_pashtun_communities_in_pakistan_afghanistan_conflict | Pashtuns]], who speak a language related to Iranian and are spread across South Afghanistan and West and Northwest Pakistan, numbering around 50 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. They constitute about half of Afghanistan's population and 15% of Pakistan's, where they are the second largest group after the Punjabis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

## [[historical_context_of_pakistan_and_afghanistan_relations | Historical Context: British India and the Durand Line]]

The [[historical_context_of_pakistan_and_afghanistan_relations | history between Pakistan and Afghanistan]] intensified in the 19th century as Britain, having consolidated its position in the Indian subcontinent (including present-day Pakistan), pushed northward into Afghanistan, a target for Russian imperial expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

*   **Early Relations**: In 1855, Britain and the Emirate of Afghanistan established friendly relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   **British Protectorate**: Following another British invasion in 1878, Afghanistan became a British protectorate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Durand Line**: In 1893, Britain and Afghanistan formally defined their border along the Durand Line, which divided traditional [[role_of_pashtun_communities_in_pakistan_afghanistan_conflict | Pashtun]] lands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **Independence**: Afghanistan gained full independence as a Kingdom in 1919 and became a UN member in 1946 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. In 1947, British India was partitioned, leading to the creation of the Dominion of Pakistan (which became the Islamic Republic of Pakistan in 1956) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

From the start, [[historical_context_of_pakistan_and_afghanistan_relations | relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan were strained]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Afghanistan questioned the borders of the new Pakistani state, arguing the Durand Line was not meant to be an official boundary and called for the [[role_of_pashtun_communities_in_pakistan_afghanistan_conflict | Pashtun]] areas to be under its control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. This led to significant tensions, with Afghanistan being the only country to vote against Pakistan's UN membership and supporting [[role_of_pashtun_communities_in_pakistan_afghanistan_conflict | Pashtun]] separatist movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Diplomatic relations were severed for several years in the early 1960s and issues continued even after Afghanistan became a republic in 1973 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

## The Soviet-Afghan War and the Rise of the Taliban

The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979 completely transformed the [[historical_context_of_pakistan_and_afghanistan_relations | relationship]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. As a close Western ally, Pakistan became a vital route for U.S. and international assistance to the mujahideen, who fought against Soviet occupation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. This support continued even after the USSR withdrew in 1988 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

The ensuing civil war in Afghanistan provided an opening for the emergence of the Taliban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Drawing on ethnic [[role_of_pashtun_communities_in_pakistan_afghanistan_conflict | Pashtuns]] educated in Pakistan's religious schools, the Taliban ("Students") soon gained the attention of Pakistan's military and intelligence establishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Pakistan saw an opportunity to gain control over its historically troublesome northern neighbour and began to support the new group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. The Taliban rapidly grew in strength, seizing the Afghan capital, Kabul, by September 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

Once in power, the Taliban introduced an extreme form of Islamic rule, strictly applying Sharia law, curtailing human and women's rights, and destroying cultural heritage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Afghanistan also became a haven for militant Islamist groups waging war against the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

## Post-9/11 Dynamics and the [[pakistani_taliban_attacks_and_security_challenges | Pakistani Taliban]] (TTP)

The attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001, by Al-Qaeda, which was harboured in Afghanistan, forced a shift in Pakistan's position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

## The Soviet-Afghan War and the Rise of the Taliban

The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979 completely transformed the [[historical_context_of_pakistan_and_afghanistan_relations | relationship]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. As a close Western ally, Pakistan became a vital route for U.S. and [[role_of_international_actors_and_geopolitical_implications | international assistance]] to the mujahideen, who fought against Soviet occupation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. This support continued even after the USSR withdrew in 1988 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

The ensuing civil war in Afghanistan provided an opening for the emergence of the Taliban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Drawing on ethnic [[role_of_pashtun_communities_in_pakistan_afghanistan_conflict | Pashtuns]] educated in Pakistan's religious schools, the Taliban ("Students") soon gained the attention of Pakistan's military and intelligence establishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Pakistan saw an opportunity to gain control over its historically troublesome northern neighbour and began to support the new group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. The Taliban rapidly grew in strength, seizing the Afghan capital, Kabul, by September 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

Once in power, the Taliban introduced an extreme form of Islamic rule, strictly applying Sharia law, curtailing human and women's rights, and destroying cultural heritage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Afghanistan also became a haven for militant Islamist groups waging war against the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

## Post-9/11 Dynamics and the [[pakistani_taliban_attacks_and_security_challenges | Pakistani Taliban]] (TTP)

The attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001, by Al-Qaeda, which was harboured in Afghanistan, forced a shift in Pakistan's position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Although Pakistan was one of only three countries to recognise the Taliban regime, 9/11 made continued support impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

While Islamabad publicly disavowed the Taliban and joined the "War on Terror," it nevertheless retained close ties with its former allies, providing sanctuary for many of their leadership and fighters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. Under increasing [[role_of_international_actors_and_geopolitical_implications | pressure]] to act against the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, Pakistan launched a massive military operation in 2004 in the [[role_of_pashtun_communities_in_pakistan_afghanistan_conflict | Pashtun]]-dominated border region (then known as the Federally Administered Tribal Areas) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. This incursion, involving about 70,000 troops, led to widespread anger among local leaders and [[role_of_pashtun_communities_in_pakistan_afghanistan_conflict | Pashtuns]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

In 2007, following a controversial military raid, a new group emerged: Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), also known as the [[pakistani_taliban_attacks_and_security_challenges | Pakistani Taliban]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. The TTP, drawing on various militant groups, launched an uprising to end Pakistan's efforts to control the [[role_of_pashtun_communities_in_pakistan_afghanistan_conflict | Pashtun]] tribal areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

*   **Relationship between TTP and Afghan Taliban**: The TTP and Afghan Taliban shared close personal, ethnic, and ideological ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. TTP fighters participated in attacks against NATO forces in Afghanistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. However, their agendas differed: the TTP aimed to oust Pakistan from the tribal areas, while the Afghan Taliban focused on expelling NATO from Afghanistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. The Afghan Taliban needed to maintain good relations with Pakistan and its security services for valuable support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   **Escalation of Conflict**: The conflict between Pakistan and the TTP escalated, culminating in a 2014 TTP attack on an army-run school, killing over 130 children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. The TTP threat appeared to decline after this, weakened by Pakistani Army operations and defections to groups like the Islamic State of Khorasan Province <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

## Taliban's Return to Power and Shifting Dynamics

As the United States began to draw down its presence in Afghanistan, the [[relationship_between_pakistan_and_the_taliban_regime_in_afghanistan | relationship between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban]] strengthened, despite the anger of Pakistan's Western partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. President Trump publicly accused Pakistan of deceit for sheltering terrorists and withheld security assistance in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

However, Pakistan's bet on the Afghan Taliban seemed to pay off when the Trump Administration signed a peace deal with the Taliban in February 2020, leading to the withdrawal of U.S. troops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. By August 2021, the last U.S. and NATO forces retreated, and the Taliban swept back into Kabul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

While the world greeted the Taliban's return with horror, Pakistan saw it as a victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. Although Pakistan joined other nations in refusing to formally recognise the Taliban as Afghanistan's new government, the Pakistani prime minister indicated his country's intention to be a link between the Taliban and the wider world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

However, Pakistani hopes of becoming the new power broker proved premature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. The Taliban's victory in Afghanistan heralded a revival of the [[pakistani_taliban_attacks_and_security_challenges | TTP]], which stepped up its attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. Despite Islamabad's hopes that the Taliban would rein in the TTP, Kabul showed little willingness to do so, instead organizing talks between the sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. A ceasefire eventually broke down in November 2022, sparking the latest wave of serious attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

Compounding this, the border issue is re-emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. A dispute over a new fence in early 2022 led the Afghan information minister to explicitly raise the unresolved status of the Durand Line and its division of the [[role_of_pashtun_communities_in_pakistan_afghanistan_conflict | Pashto Nation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

Other signs suggest a change in the [[relationship_between_pakistan_and_the_taliban_regime_in_afghanistan | Pakistan-Taliban relationship]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. The Taliban regime in Kabul appears to have little need or desire for Pakistan's role as an intermediary on the world stage and seems to be actively pushing back against Islamabad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. For example, the Taliban has been engaging with [[Pakistans geopolitical relations with Afghanistan India Iran and China | India]], Pakistan's arch-enemy, a relationship New Delhi seems open to developing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.

This all suggests that, having regained control in Afghanistan, the Taliban, or at least important elements within it, are happy to push back against Pakistan's efforts to control them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. The Taliban's apparent refusal to crack down on the [[pakistani_taliban_attacks_and_security_challenges | TTP]], coupled with references to the contested border and a divided [[role_of_pashtun_communities_in_pakistan_afghanistan_conflict | Pashtun]] nation, will likely be a source of concern for Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. Having created or nurtured the Afghan Taliban for its own ends to control Afghanistan, Pakistan may now face the real possibility that the tide is turning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. If the Afghan Taliban is embracing its Pakistani offshoot and building relations with India, it would mark a dramatic reversal of fortunes in [[relationship_between_pakistan_and_the_taliban_regime_in_afghanistan | relations between Pakistan and the Taliban]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

Serbia, a landlocked nation in Southeastern Europe, has a rich and complex history marked by periods of significant political instability and transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:20">[01:33:20]</a>. From its medieval origins as a kingdom to its central role in the formation and dissolution of Yugoslavia, the country has frequently experienced widespread public pressure and political upheaval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:20">[02:22:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:20">[01:00:20]</a>.

## Historical Background

After existing as a kingdom in medieval times, Serbia was conquered by the Ottoman Empire in the 15th and 16th centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:20">[02:22:20]</a>. It gradually regained autonomy during the 19th century through a series of uprisings, finally achieving full independence in 1878 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:20">[02:29:20]</a>.

Following the First World War, Serbia was central to the creation of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, later renamed Yugoslavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:20">[02:39:20]</a>. After the Second World War, Serbia became one of the republics within the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia under the leadership of Josip Broz Tito <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:20">[02:50:20]</a>.

## The Yugoslav Wars and Milošević Era

The death of Josip Broz Tito in May 1980 led to the steady fracturing of the Yugoslav federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:20">[03:00:20]</a>. Growing economic difficulties intensified nationalism across the country's six republics, as well as in Kosovo, a majority-Albanian province of Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:20">[03:05:20]</a>.

Against this backdrop, Slobodan Milošević, then head of the Serbian Communist Party, rose to prominence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:20">[03:15:20]</a>. Framing himself as a champion of Serbian nationalism, he launched the "Anti-Bureaucratic Revolution," a series of mass protests that saw him become Serbia's president in 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:20">[03:22:20]</a>.

While Milošević strengthened his grip on power, his actions deepened ethnic divisions, destabilizing the federation and accelerating its eventual collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:20">[03:35:20]</a>. This culminated in 1991 when Slovenia and Croatia declared independence, marking the start of the Yugoslav Wars, which later spread to Bosnia and Kosovo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:20">[03:45:20]</a>. The international community imposed sanctions on Serbia, blaming it for inciting and prolonging the wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:20">[03:58:20]</a>. Despite economic collapse and growing dissent, Milošević steadily strengthened his control over the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:20">[04:05:20]</a>.

Opposition grew by the turn of the millennium, especially after NATO's bombing of Serbia in 1999 following fighting in Kosovo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:20">[04:11:20]</a>. In 2000, after Milošević refused to acknowledge defeat in a presidential election, hundreds of thousands took to the streets in mass protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:20">[04:24:20]</a>. On October 5, 2000, Milošević was forced from power, arrested, and later extradited to The Hague to stand trial for war crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:20">[04:33:20]</a>. He died in 2006 before a verdict could be delivered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:20">[04:44:20]</a>.

## Post-Milošević Instability and the Rise of Vučić

In the years following Milošević's downfall, Serbia struggled to find political stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:20">[04:49:20]</a>. Although the country moved towards democracy, political infighting and economic challenges hindered progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:20">[04:55:20]</a>. A low point occurred in 2003 when the country's reformist, pro-European Prime Minister, Zoran Đinđić, was assassinated by elements of the security forces in conjunction with organized crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:20">[05:01:20]</a>.

While the push towards European integration continued under the Democratic Party, nationalist parties like the Serbian Radical Party maintained considerable popular support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:20">[05:15:20]</a>.

### Emergence of Aleksandar Vučić
By the end of the 2000s, Serbian politics experienced a significant shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:20">[05:28:20]</a>. Public disillusionment with the Democratic Party grew due to a lack of tangible results despite its promotion of reform and European integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:20">[05:34:20]</a>. Meanwhile, although nationalist sentiment intensified after [[kosovo_issue_and_its_impact_on_serbias_foreign_policy | Kosovo]] declared independence in February 2008, many were tiring of the radicals' extremism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:20">[05:44:20]</a>.

This paved the way for the emergence of Aleksandar Vučić <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:20">[06:04:20]</a>. Despite having served as Milošević's Minister for Information and building a reputation as a staunch nationalist, Vučić rebranded himself as a pro-European reformer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:20">[06:10:20]</a>. In early 2008, he broke away from the Radical Party and co-founded the Serbian Progressive Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:20">[06:20:20]</a>.

Vučić's political career steadily gained momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:20">[06:27:20]</a>. After serving as Deputy Prime Minister from 2012 to 2014, the Progressives won a landslide victory in the 2014 general election, making Vučić Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:20">[06:31:20]</a>. He secured another significant win in early elections in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:20">[06:44:20]</a>.

The real turning point came in 2017 when Vučić was elected president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:20">[06:51:20]</a>. Although the Serbian political system is similar to the French model (president oversees foreign policy, prime minister handles domestic policy), Vučić became the undisputed power in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:20">[06:57:20]</a>. The Progressives won further parliamentary elections, and he secured a second five-year presidential term in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:20">[07:09:20]</a>. Over the last decade, Aleksandar Vučić has come to completely dominate the Serbian political scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:20">[07:18:20]</a>.

## Recent Protests and Ongoing Instability

While supporters credit Vučić's administration with significant economic growth and major infrastructure projects, opponents accuse him of steadily rolling back democratic freedoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:20">[07:26:20]</a>. They allege suppression of the media, manipulation of elections, use of state resources for political patronage, and widespread corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:20">[07:49:20]</a>. Concerns also exist about significant environmental damage due to his quest for foreign investment, citing projects like the Belgrade waterfront development and proposed lithium mining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:20">[08:09:20]</a>.

Opposition parties argue that international partners like the European Union and the United States have been complicit by prioritizing stability over democracy, leading them to believe they can no longer work through normal democratic channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:20">[08:24:20]</a>. As a result, frequent mass protests have occurred over the past decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:20">[08:41:20]</a>.

### The Novi Sad Railway Station Incident (2024-2025)
The latest wave of unrest began with a tragic incident on November 1, 2024, when the newly reconstructed canopy at Novi Sad railway station collapsed, killing 15 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:20">[08:52:20]</a>. Many immediately argued that corruption was behind the tragedy, blaming poor workmanship by the Chinese consortium and inadequate safety inspections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:20">[09:07:20]</a>.

While the transport minister resigned and officials were arrested, many saw the incident as symbolic of deep-rooted mismanagement within the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:20">[09:18:20]</a>. Students began protesting, demanding justice, greater transparency, and increased government spending on infrastructure and education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:20">[09:30:20]</a>. Despite attempts to suppress them, the protests spread across the country, attracting other groups like farmers, academics, and lawyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:20">[09:41:20]</a>.

In January 2025, thousands of students marched 80 km from Novi Sad to Belgrade, blocking key highways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:20">[09:51:20]</a>. Tens of thousands continue to rally in what is seen as the most significant unrest in Serbia since the fall of Milošević <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:20">[10:01:20]</a>.

### Government Response and Outlook
The protests have led to questions about the future of the government and President Vučić <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:20">[10:10:20]</a>. While the students are not explicitly trying to bring down the government and are avoiding direct engagement with opposition parties, they are focused on more profound changes to the political system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:20">[10:24:20]</a>.

President Vučić remains defiant, arguing that the protests are not a reflection of popular will but rather stirred up by foreign forces seeking to undermine Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:20">[10:38:20]</a>. His supporters contend he enjoys greater national popularity than critics suggest, especially outside urban centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:20">[10:53:20]</a>. The lack of a coherent, credible opposition also works in his favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:20">[11:07:20]</a>.

Nevertheless, the administration is concerned and has made concessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25:20">[11:25:20]</a>. This was highlighted by the resignations of Prime Minister Miloš Vučević and Novi Sad's current mayor on January 28 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:20">[11:33:20]</a>. Evidence suggests the protests are growing, and past experience in Serbia has shown that popular protest can force leaders from power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:20">[11:46:20]</a>. The current situation is a battle of wills, testing how much more traction the protests can gain and how long their momentum can last <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:20">[12:04:20]</a>. If demonstrations continue to grow or if serious violence erupts, the pressure could become overwhelming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:20">[12:15:20]</a>. While Vučić has experience tackling widespread protests, history shows that such pressure can be bearable only for a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:20">[12:29:20]</a>.

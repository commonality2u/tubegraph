De facto states are a distinctive feature of contemporary [[impact_on_international_relations | international relations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. While having broken away from a country and achieved some independence, they are largely, or completely, unrecognised by the wider international community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Facing political and economic isolation, and often under threat of invasion, these entities almost always rely on a third country – known as a [[the_role_of_patron_states_in_de_facto_state_survival | patron state]] – for diplomatic, financial, and military support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

The relationship between a de facto state and its [[the_role_of_patron_states_in_de_facto_state_survival | patron state]] can be extremely complex, as their goals are not always aligned, leading to potential tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Such tensions can arise if the de facto state seeks more distance from its patron, or conversely, desires a closer relationship, potentially even full integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## South Ossetia: A Case Study with Russia

Russia's relationship with South Ossetia, a breakaway Georgian region since the early 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, exemplifies these complexities.

### Historical Context and Emergence of De Facto Statehood
South Ossetia is located in the north-central part of Georgia, making up about 5.5% of Georgia's territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Its population is estimated between 35,000 and 40,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Ossetians are predominantly Christian Orthodox people living in an area straddling the Caucasus Mountains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

The region's modern history with Russia began in the late 18th century as Imperial Russia expanded into the Caucasus, conquering northern and then southern parts, including Georgia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. After the Russian Revolution in 1917, South Ossetia became part of an independent Georgian state, leading to uprisings that were brutally suppressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. In 1921, the Soviet Red Army captured Georgia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Despite hopes for reunification with North Ossetia, South Ossetia was granted self-rule as the South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast within the new Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic, a status it held for seven decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

As the Soviet Union began to dissolve in the late 1980s, South Ossetia sought to break away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. In 1989, its Supreme Soviet voted to unite with North Ossetia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. The following year, South Ossetia declared itself a separate Soviet republic and sought Moscow's recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Georgia responded by revoking South Ossetia's autonomy and declaring a state of emergency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. In 1991, newly independent Georgia attempted to retake South Ossetia by force, but was unsuccessful in fully seizing the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. A ceasefire was eventually accepted, establishing a joint peacekeeping force with Russia and opening peace talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

Peace lasted for a decade, with significant contact between South Ossetia and Georgia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. However, this ended in 2003 with the overthrow of the Georgian government and the rise of a pro-Western president, Mikhail Saakashvili, who promised to reassert control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Renewed fighting ensued, and despite Georgia's offer of maximum autonomy, South Ossetian leaders held an independence referendum, which showed overwhelming support for statehood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

### The 2008 War and Russian Recognition
Tensions remained high between South Ossetia and Georgia, fueled by growing hostility between Russia and the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. In April 2008, NATO's formal welcome of Georgia's aspiration for membership was condemned by Moscow as a "huge strategic mistake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

This culminated on August 7, 2008, when Russia and Georgia went to war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. Georgia ordered its forces into South Ossetia, claiming an attack on its troops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Within hours, Russian forces flooded into South Ossetia through the Roki Tunnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Five days later, Georgia was forced to capitulate after a massive Russian onslaught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. While Russian troops largely withdrew from Georgia, South Ossetia and [[abkhazia]] (approximately 20% of Georgia's territory) remained under Russia's effective control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

Just two weeks later, Moscow recognized both South Ossetia and [[abkhazia]] as independent sovereign states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Although most of the world rejected South Ossetia's independence, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Nauru, and Syria eventually recognized it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

### Russia's Strategy: "Creeping Integration" vs. Annexation
Despite Russia's recognition of South Ossetia's independence, most observers believe the region had little real interest in outright statehood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Opinion polls indicated overwhelming support for unification with the larger and more populous North Ossetia within the Russian Federation, leading to growing calls for a referendum on integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

However, Russia steadfastly resisted these calls for annexation, despite growing economic and political ties and increasing Russian control over South Ossetia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Instead, Moscow appeared to prefer "creeping de facto integration" over actual unification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. This approach continued even after Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. For example, a 2015 treaty of alliance and integration between Russia and South Ossetia guaranteed South Ossetia's defense and security and created a customs union, but it was explicitly framed in terms of interstate relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

### The May 2022 Referendum and Russia's Intervention
Despite Russia's apparent opposition, unification with Russia remains firmly on South Ossetia's agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. This was most recently highlighted in Spring 2022, when the South Ossetian leader, Anatoly Bibilov, announced plans for a referendum on union with Russia, amidst international focus on the [[impact_of_russias_war_in_ukraine_on_international_relations | war in Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

Initially, few took the idea seriously, viewing it as an attempt by Bibilov to shore up support during a tough re-election campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. However, even after his defeat, Bibilov announced the poll would proceed on July 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

The planned vote was condemned by Georgia, the European Union, and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. More significantly, Russia also announced its opposition to the referendum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. Russian Government Spokesman Dmitry Peskov indicated the Kremlin had not even been consulted and had serious concerns about the legal implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. It was clear that Moscow had no intention of seeing annexation at this stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

On May 31, the new South Ossetian leader, Alan Gagloyev, issued a decree canceling the vote, leaving little doubt that Moscow had intervened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. The decree cited legal uncertainties and emphasized that South Ossetia could not make unilateral decisions affecting Russia's interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

### Reasons Behind Russia's Stance
The decision to cancel the referendum might seem strange, given the strong support for unification within South Ossetia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. After decades of gradual integration, South Ossetia is already effectively part of the Russian Federation, making formal annexation seem like the obvious next step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. Furthermore, the [[impact_of_russias_war_in_ukraine_on_international_relations | war in Ukraine]] and existing extensive sanctions against Russia appeared to offer an ideal moment for annexation, with little additional economic or diplomatic cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. It could have also been politically useful, sending a message to the West and paving the way for anticipated annexations in eastern Ukraine, such as Donetsk and Luhansk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

However, the problem evidently lies with Russia's calculations:
*   **Lack of Domestic Benefit**: Russians do not share the same emotional connection to Ossetia as they do to Crimea or the Donbas, meaning annexation would offer fewer domestic political advantages for the Kremlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.
*   **International Costs**: Annexation would lead to further reputational damage for seizing territory from yet another sovereign state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.
*   **Bargaining Chip with Georgia**: South Ossetia remains a useful bargaining chip with Georgia, which has increasingly aligned with the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.
*   **Reintegration Hurdles**: While annexation would not be internationally recognized, in practical terms, it would make it very difficult for Russia to leave the door open for South Ossetia's eventual reintegration into Georgia, as the Russian constitution forbids giving up territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.
*   **Preferred Option**: Gradual integration short of actual annexation represents a better long-term option for Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

Despite these explanations, some argue the current situation remains puzzling. The idea that Moscow could eventually hand South Ossetia back to Georgia, defying a deep-rooted wish for unification, seems unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. This suggests that the full story is more complex and difficult for outsiders to decode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.

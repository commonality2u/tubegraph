Bosnia and Herzegovina, a country of dense forests and stunning mountains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, remains deeply divided a quarter-century after a peace agreement ended its brutal war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Its unwieldy and dysfunctional political system has led to repeated calls for fundamental changes, including the abolition of [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]], one of the country's two territorial entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This ongoing struggle highlights deep-seated issues of [[international_relations_and_national_identity_in_the_balkans | nationalism]] and [[bosnian_political_system_and_reform | political reform]].

## Historical Context and Territorial Arrangement

Bosnia and Herzegovina declared independence in March 1992, following the lead of other federal republics like Croatia, Slovenia, and Macedonia, and joined the UN months later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. However, this was rejected by the country's Serbs, who, with support from Serbia, unilaterally broke away to form their own separatist state, [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. This led to a bitter three-way war that also involved Bosnian Croats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

In early 1994, Bosnian Croats and Bosniaks (formerly known as Bosnian Muslims) formed the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. The war with the Bosnian Serbs continued until the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, which prompted international intervention and peace talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

### The Dayton Accords

The General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, known as the [[dayton_accords_and_bosnias_territorial_arrangements | Dayton Accords]], was signed on December 14, 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Under this agreement:
*   [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]], comprising 49 percent of Bosnia's territory, gave up its claim to independence and reintegrated into the state alongside the Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   Day-to-day issues were primarily handled by the entities, with a weak central government managing only a few key areas like foreign policy and immigration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
*   The central government's structure reflected the entities' power, with a joint presidency comprising two members from the Federation (a Bosniak and a Croat) and one from [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]] (a Serb) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. The Council of Ministers was similarly divided on a two-to-one ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

## Emergence of Tensions and Nationalism

After about a decade, the country's political structures, which entrenched [[ethnic_divisions_in_bosniaherzegovina | ethnic identity]], began to be seen as discriminatory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. Failed reform attempts led to hardened positions and increased dysfunction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

*   **Bosnian Serb Nationalism**: Leaders began openly discussing breaking away to form an independent state or uniting with Serbia, both of which are banned under the peace deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **Bosnian Croat Demands**: Bosnian Croats started calling for their own entity, similar to [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]], a position increasingly supported by neighboring Croatia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   **Bosniak Centralization Calls**: Bosniaks viewed the problems as a result of excessive decentralization, leading to a "federation within a federation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. Many began openly advocating for the abolition of [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

### Arguments for Abolishing [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]] (Bosniak Perspective)

Many Bosniaks and some observers believe abolishing [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]] is the answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.
*   **Problematic Origins**: They argue that the entity is a product of genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Dysfunctional Relationship**: There is an increasingly difficult relationship between [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]] and the central government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   **Nationalist Dominance**: The Bosnian Serb leadership is seen as dominated by nationalists who reject the very existence of the Bosnian state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. Milorad Dodik, the Bosnian Serb member of the presidency, continually threatens to hold a vote on breaking away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Deliberate Dysfunction**: Bosnian Serb leaders appear to be actively trying to make the country as dysfunctional as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   **Persistent Serb Nationalism**: There are worrying signs of persistent Serb [[international_relations_and_national_identity_in_the_balkans | nationalism]], including graffiti hero-worshipping wartime leaders convicted of war crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. There is also a growing move to deny atrocities committed during the conflict, including the Srebrenica massacre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   **Stagnation**: Bosniaks believe [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]] entrenches past [[international_relations_and_national_identity_in_the_balkans | nationalism]] and is holding the country back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

### Bosnian Serb Perspective

Bosnian Serbs view [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]] as a legitimate entity underpinned by international treaties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   **Bosniak Challenges**: They feel it is being increasingly challenged by Bosniaks who seek its abolition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   **Mutual Nationalism**: They argue that Bosniaks are equally imbued with exclusionary [[international_relations_and_national_identity_in_the_balkans | nationalism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   **Unrealistic Secession**: While acknowledging secession talk, most Bosnian Serbs know it is unrealistic and any attempt to break away would fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. This threat is often used by leaders like Milorad Dodik for their own political ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
*   **Homeland Identity**: The idea that all Bosnian Serbs look to Serbia as a motherland is inaccurate; while they identify as Serbs, Bosnia is their homeland, not Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Many privately acknowledge that joining Serbia would make them a "provincial backwater" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.
*   **Limited Support for War Criminals**: The veneration of war criminals is limited to a small section of nationalists and does not mean the wider community desires a return to conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. The recent memory of war means most people do not want to return to fighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

## Is Abolishing [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]] the Answer?

Bosnia clearly needs [[bosnian_political_system_and_reform | reform]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. Its system of governance has been judged contrary to basic human rights, and the inability to introduce changes affects ordinary people, leading to stagnation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. This failure also prevents Bosnia from pursuing EU membership, a potential driver for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

However, abolishing [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]] does not appear to be a feasible solution, at least not without a return to conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **Functionality**: [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]] is a relatively functional single entity, more so than the Federation with its various units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
*   **Lack of Feasibility**: There is no practical way to abolish it, and Bosnian Serbs will not give up territorial control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
*   **No International Support**: Foreign diplomats assert that [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]] is here to stay, and there is no international support for its abolition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

### The Vicious Cycle of Nationalism

The evolution of [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]] as an ethno-national entity entrenches many of Bosnia's problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. It serves as a "lightning rod" for nationalist politicians on all sides, energizing their communities and creating a destabilizing vicious circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. Bosnian Serb talks of breaking away provoke Bosniak calls to abolish [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]], which in turn reinforces the Bosnian Serb message that secession is their only way out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

## Path to Fundamental [[bosnian_political_system_and_reform | Reform]]

Abolishing [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]] is not a panacea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Any fundamental [[bosnian_political_system_and_reform | reform]] must begin by moving away from nationalist talking points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

Bosniaks and Bosnian Serbs need to accept two key principles:
1.  Bosnia-Herzegovina is a single, indivisible state that is here to stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
2.  [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]] is an entity that makes up that state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

This means Bosnian Serbs must cease questioning the territorial integrity of the Bosnian state, and Bosniaks must stop questioning the legitimacy of [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. This mutual acceptance could build enough trust for more fundamental change to be realized through compromise, laying the foundation for a sustainable future for Bosnia-Herzegovina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

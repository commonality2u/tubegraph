## A Lingering Post-War Dispute
While global attention has been focused on Russia's war in Ukraine, a long-standing territorial dispute in Russia's east has been escalating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This involves the southern Kuril Islands, to which senior Japanese figures have recently restated their country's claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This growing tension has raised the possibility of a new conflict on Russia's borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

Nearly eight decades after the end of the Second World War, Russia and Japan have yet to reach a formal peace treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. This is primarily due to their ongoing disagreement over the southern Kuril Islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

## The Nature of Peace Settlements
While conflicts often conclude with a formal peace treaty, this is not always the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. Sometimes, countries may opt for a ceasefire, which leaves main issues unresolved even if minor ones are addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. Occasionally, a "halfway house" agreement is reached, signifying the end of conflict and addressing some issues, but falling short of a full and final settlement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>. The relationship between Russia and Japan presents one of the most interesting cases in modern international relations regarding the absence of such a final settlement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.

## The Kuril Islands Dispute
The Kuril Islands, strategically important and rich in mineral and energy reserves, have been the core of the dispute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. The archipelago consists of 56 main volcanic islands and many islets, stretching about 1,200 kilometers (750 miles) between Hokkaido, Japan, and Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

### Historical Overview
The story of the dispute largely begins in the 19th century as Russia expanded into East Asia, leading to direct confrontation with Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.

*   **Treaty of Shimoda (1855)**: Russia and Japan agreed to share Sakhalin Island and divided control of the Kuril Islands. Russia took islands north of Urup, while Japan gained sovereignty over the three main southern islands—Iturup, Kunashir, and Shikotan—as well as the Habomai Islets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.
*   **Treaty of St Petersburg (1875)**: Russia ceded the entire Kuril Island chain to Japan in return for control of all of Sakhalin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.
*   **Russo-Japanese War (1904)**: Tensions escalated, resulting in an unprecedented defeat for a European power. Russia was forced to cede the southern half of Sakhalin Island to Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. This war had significant regional and international implications, including paving the way for Japan's occupation of Korea and Chinese Manchuria, and is attributed by many to contributing to the Russian Revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.
*   **World War II and Soviet Occupation**: The rivalry between Japan and the Soviet Union intensified, leading to an undeclared war in 1939 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. In April 1941, they signed a neutrality pact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>. However, following the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945 and the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan on August 8, 1945, invading the southern half of Sakhalin and subsequently the Kuril Islands, despite Japan's surrender on August 15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. By early September 1945, the entire island chain was in Russian hands, and their Japanese inhabitants were expelled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>.

## Efforts Towards a Peace Treaty
Despite the Soviet Union cementing control, by the mid-1950s, the atmosphere began to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>.

*   **1956 Peace Declaration**: Moscow and Tokyo signed a landmark declaration on October 19, 1956, formally ending the state of war and re-establishing diplomatic relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>. They agreed to settle future disputes peacefully, drop compensation claims, and negotiate trade and fishing agreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>. Crucially, however, they could not sign a formal peace treaty due to disagreements over the Kuril Islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. The declaration stated that Shikotan and the Habomai Islets would be returned to Japan upon conclusion of a final peace treaty, but Japan insisted on sovereignty over all four of its 'Northern Territories' (Iturup, Kunashir, Shikotan, and the Habomai Islets), originally ceded in 1855 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>. Efforts to reach a settlement on the northern boundary proved fruitless for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>.

*   **Post-Cold War Developments**: With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Japan called on the newly independent Russian Federation to formally return the islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>. Moscow, however, was reluctant, citing Japan's close alliance with the United States (fearing militarization) and the islands' economic value, including extensive fishing waters and potential oil and gas reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>. Russia's desire to retain the islands was underscored by then-President Dmitry Medvedev's visit in 2010, the first by a Russian leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.

*   **Renewed Hopes and Setbacks**: By 2016, prospects seemed to improve amidst closer commercial links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>. Russia's President Vladimir Putin and Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe reached an eight-point agreement to promote economic cooperation, seemingly agreeing that the Kuril Islands question remained open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>. Two years later, they agreed that talks should be based on the 1956 peace declaration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>. However, hopes were short-lived. In 2020, Russia introduced a constitutional change explicitly outlawing any moves to relinquish territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>. Simultaneously, it increased its military presence on the islands, installing sophisticated anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>. In July 2021, the Russian Prime Minister visited Iturup, an island claimed by Japan, with Russian politicians making it clear that Moscow considered the question closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>.

## Impact of the War in Ukraine
The conflict in Ukraine has brought the issue to the fore again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>.
On February 28, 2022, shortly after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Japan's Foreign Ministry stated that Russia was in occupation of the 'Northern Territories' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a>. Russia responded that the islands were legally transferred as "punishment for Japan's aggression and its alliance with Nazi Germany" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>. However, Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi openly called the islands an integral part of Japan, a clear break from past language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>. The United States sided with Tokyo, stating its support for Japan's claims since the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>.

Things have escalated further, with Putin signing an amendment exempting businesses on the islands from various taxes for up to 20 years, a decision condemned by Tokyo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>. Japan's decision to join wider Western sanctions on Russia has strained relations, leading Moscow to add Japan to its list of unfriendly countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>. This has prompted speculation about potential reprisals, such as banning Japanese fishing vessels from the waters around the islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>. Tokyo has also increased its monitoring of Russian military activity in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>.

## Prospects for Conflict and Settlement
The likelihood of the current developments leading to conflict is considered highly unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>. Despite its frustration, Japan is not expected to invade the islands, even with Russia's military preoccupied, as Russia remains a nuclear power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>. Just as [[Russias potential responses to Lithuanias actions|NATO]] avoids intervention in Ukraine to prevent a major escalation, Tokyo will avoid direct attacks on what Moscow considers Russian territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>.

Regarding the prospects for a settlement, the prevailing view is that the ongoing conflict in Ukraine will make the dispute over the Kuril Islands more difficult to resolve, at least for now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>. Indeed, Russia has already announced the suspension of peace talks with Japan over the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>.

However, the matter is not necessarily over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>. At some point, Russia will likely emerge from its current economic isolation and may need to rebuild ties with Western countries, including Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>. This could create an opportunity for negotiations leading to a final settlement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>. Much will depend on what happens to and within Russia after the war in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>. Over 75 years since the end of the Second World War, [[History of Russia Japan relations|Japan and Russia]] still lack a full and final peace treaty, and the question remains whether the new war in Europe will eventually provide an opportunity to settle this long-standing issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>.

The relationship between Turkey and the Kurds has a long and complex history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. For over four decades, the Turkish government has actively combated [[Historical quest for Kurdish independence | Kurdish efforts]] to establish a homeland, both within Turkey and along its borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Post-World War I Aspirations and Divisions

The story of modern Kurdish aspirations for independence largely begins after the First World War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Following the collapse of the defeated Ottoman Empire, a plan was initially drafted to divide the Anatolian Peninsula, which included the possibility of creating a Kurdish homeland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. However, these plans were thwarted by Turkish nationalist forces led by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. With the establishment of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, the hopes for a Kurdish state were extinguished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

Instead, the Kurdish population found itself divided among five countries: Turkey (where most resided), Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. For decades, the prospect of Kurdish independence remained distant, with occasional uprisings in various countries being heavily resisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## Emergence of Insurgencies

A significant new insurgency emerged in Turkey in 1984, when the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) launched a campaign for Kurdish independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Initially based in the rural Kurdish southeast, its violent insurgency soon expanded into Turkey's towns and cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

In the early 1990s, the issue gained a broader regional dimension with the establishment of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in northern Iraq after the First Gulf War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This development raised Turkish fears that it could become the basis for an eventual Kurdish state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. The PKK also began using the mountainous areas of northern Iraq as bases to launch attacks on Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Although PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan was arrested in 1999, Turkey has remained extremely nervous about Kurdish efforts to establish a state, whether within its borders or in neighboring countries, fearing it could fuel further separatism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

## Kurdish Self-Rule in Syria and Turkish Response

The Arab Spring in 2011, which spread to Syria and escalated into civil war, presented a new opportunity for Kurdish groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. While Bashar al-Assad's forces were preoccupied in the south, Kurdish groups in northern Syria, primarily led by the PYD and its armed wing, the YPG, seized the chance to establish self-rule, eventually declaring the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (AANES) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

Turkey viewed this development as a significant threat, especially due to the PYD's ties to the PKK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. However, Ankara initially had limited options to curtail Kurdish autonomy because the rise of ISIS led key Western countries, including the United States, to support the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in combating the Islamic State <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

By 2019, with ISIS largely defeated, the Trump administration announced the withdrawal of US troops from northern Syria after talks with Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Turkey immediately seized this opportunity to invade, launching "Operation Peace Spring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. This mission aimed to establish a "safe zone" for Syrian refugees in Turkey and diminish Kurdish control in northern and northeastern Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

The operation had wider implications, forcing the SDF to seek support from Russia and the Assad regime, thereby propping up their power in Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. It also led to a resurgence of ISIS as Kurdish forces were distracted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Following significant international diplomatic pressure and threats of sanctions, Turkey agreed to a ceasefire and withdrew its forces to a 115-kilometer-long strip of Syrian territory along its border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

Despite this, Turkey maintained pressure on the Kurds, regularly indicating the possibility of another full-scale invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Speculation grew in late 2022 after a bomb attack in Istanbul was linked to the YPG, though a mass attack did not occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Many observers believe Turkey was merely awaiting the opportune moment to act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

## Prospects for the Kurds in Syria

The fall of the Assad regime is seen as potentially opening the way for a major Turkish invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. With Russia's reduced involvement and the new HTS administration in Damascus supported by pro-Turkish forces, Ankara may perceive this as an ideal time to act against the Kurds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Reports are already emerging of Turkey and its allied proxies preparing a major assault on Kurdish-held areas in northern and eastern Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

If this occurs, it would pose a massive threat to the Kurdish areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Although the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces have considerable combat experience fighting ISIS, they are stretched thin across a large area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Turkey, with its air power, superior artillery, and Syrian proxy forces, would hold a significant advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. While Kurdish forces could mount stiff resistance, they would almost certainly require external assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

### Limited External Support

The likelihood of significant outside support for the Kurds appears low:

*   **Western Countries (especially the United States):** While the US has supported the Kurdish-led SDF against ISIS, Turkey is a NATO ally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. Historically, the US has avoided confrontations of this kind with Ankara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. It is highly doubtful that the US would militarily assist the Kurdish areas against a Turkish attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Any US response would likely focus on de-escalation, diplomatic pressure, economic sanctions, and calls for restraint, rather than military intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Other Western states are unlikely to engage or have the capacity to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   **Israel:** Although Israel has historically shown sympathy for the Kurds, viewing them as a counterbalance to shared adversaries like Iran, Syria, and Islamist groups, and has voiced support for Kurdish aspirations, it is unlikely to offer direct military assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. Direct military confrontation with Turkey would be too dangerous and would strain relations with allies like the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. Any Israeli assistance would likely be focused and carefully calibrated, possibly through intelligence sharing, to avoid broader conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
*   **Iraqi Kurds:** While sharing ethnic and cultural ties, the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in Iraq has been weakened financially and maintains a complex relationship with Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Supporting Syrian Kurds, particularly the YPG, which has ties to the PKK, could jeopardize these relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Therefore, while Iraqi Kurds may provide humanitarian assistance, significant military support to Syria's Kurds is unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

Ankara may calculate that now is the ideal moment to strike against the Kurds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. If Turkey proceeds with an invasion, it will almost certainly lead to a brutal conflict with many casualties, echoing past experiences where hundreds of thousands were killed, injured, and displaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. Far from ending the fighting, the new post-Assad era in Syria may usher in a new and bloodier phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

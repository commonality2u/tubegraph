Moldova, a country next to Ukraine, emerged as an independent state following the collapse of the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. It is often considered an "accidental country," having once been part of Romania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The relationship between Moldova and Romania is an interesting example of "kin states," where two states effectively emerge for a single nation, often maintaining a fascinating relationship and a national aspiration for union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Geographical and Demographic Overview

Romania and Moldova are located in southeast Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Romania spans 240,000 square kilometres (over 90,000 square miles), making it the 81st largest of the 193 United Nations members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Moldova, on its eastern border, is significantly smaller at 34,000 square kilometres (13,000 square miles), about a seventh of Romania's size, and ranks as the 135th largest UN member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. In terms of population, Romania has approximately 19.3 million inhabitants, while Moldova's population stands at about 2.6 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Historical Timeline and Evolution

The two countries share a long and complex [[historical_context_of_moldova_and_transnistria | history]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

### Medieval Principalities and Ottoman Influence
While many point to their Roman origins, the story of Moldova and Romania truly begins with the medieval principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. By the mid-16th century, these principalities had become Ottoman vassal states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

### Imperial Russian Expansion and Romanian Unification
Against the backdrop of Ottoman decline, in 1812, the eastern part of Moldavia, an area known as Bessarabia, was ceded to Imperial Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. In 1859, Wallachia and what remained of Moldavia merged, eventually forming the Kingdom of Romania in 1881 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Bessarabia remained outside Romanian control until the Russian Revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Seizing this opportunity, Bessarabia declared independence and reunited with Romania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

### A Short and Unhappy Union (Interwar Period)
This reunion proved to be brief and troubled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Romania largely ignored Bessarabia, focusing more on its newly acquired territories to the west, such as Transylvania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Crucially, the Soviet Union never accepted this annexation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### Soviet Era and the Moldavian SSR
In June 1940, following the outbreak of the Second World War, Moscow retook the region, creating the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic (Moldavian SSR), one of the 15 top-level republics of the USSR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Despite Romania falling to communism after the war and becoming a Soviet satellite state, Moscow ensured that the two territories remained separate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

Fearing pan-Romanian sentiment, Soviet authorities actively promoted a distinct [[moldovan_identity_and_political_stability | Moldovan identity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This involved emphasizing differences between the languages, reintroducing the Cyrillic script, and bringing in Russian and Ukrainian settlers to alter the republic's demographic composition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. As a result, Ukrainians and Russians still represent approximately seven and four percent of the Moldovan population, respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

### Post-Soviet Independence and Divergence
The situation changed with the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. On December 25, 1991, the republic of Moldova became an independent state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. Initially, there was a strong sense that the two countries might pursue unification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. However, this sentiment was short-lived, as divisions emerged in Moldova between those advocating union and those supporting a separate Moldovan state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

The two countries then embarked on very different paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Romania, along with other Central and Eastern European countries, aligned itself with the West, joining NATO in 2004 and the European Union in 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. In contrast, Moldova struggled to entirely break free from its Soviet past, facing years of [[moldovan_identity_and_political_stability | political instability]] and continuously oscillating between governments favoring closer ties with the European Union and those wanting stronger relations with Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

The historical experience of the previous union, where Bessarabia was largely ignored, shapes the contemporary Moldovan perspective, contributing to a sense that Moldova would be a minor player in a united Romania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. This historical context continues to influence [[prospects_and_challenges_of_moldova_and_romania_unification | prospects and challenges of Moldova and Romania unification]] today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. The existence of [[moldovatransnistria_relations | Transnistria]], a region unilaterally declaring independence in 1991 and still supported by Moscow, further complicates potential unification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

Once close allies, [[turkey_and_israel_diplomatic_relations | tensions have steadily risen]] between Turkey and Israel over the past two decades, now appearing to be close to a boiling point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Against the backdrop of growing tensions in [[turkeys_role_in_syria_and_its_effects_on_relations_with_israel | Syria]], there is a very real threat of a confrontation between Israeli and Turkish forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## From Allies to Strategic Opponents

Alliances are a central feature of international relations, but even the closest collaborations can collapse, leading former partners to become strategic opponents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The relationship between Israel and Turkey is a notable example, having transformed from a close strategic partnership with strong defense and intelligence cooperation to seemingly being on the brink of war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

Geographically, Israel and Turkey are situated at the eastern end of the Mediterranean, approximately 120 miles (200 kilometres) apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Both share a border with Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Turkey is significantly larger than Israel, covering 780,000 km² (300,000 miles²) compared to Israel's 21,000 km² (8,000 miles²) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Turkey also has a much larger population, with around 88 million inhabitants versus Israel's 9.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### Historical Context and Early Relations

While both Turkey (founded 1923) and Israel (founded 1948) are relatively modern states, their [[history_of_alliance_and_conflict_between_turkey_and_israel | relationship dates back centuries]] to the Ottoman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. The Ottoman Empire, which ruled large parts of the Middle East including present-day Israel, historically provided sanctuary for Jews fleeing persecution in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

Despite Turkey voting against the UN plan to partition Palestine and abstaining from the vote to admit Israel to the UN, it became the first Muslim-majority country to recognise Israel on March 28, 1949, establishing [[turkey_and_israel_diplomatic_relations | diplomatic relations]] shortly thereafter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. This decision was partly based on a shared geostrategic outlook during the Cold War, with both countries aligning with the Western camp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. They also shared a similar ideological worldview, being founded on secular nationalist traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

Over the following decades, the relationship evolved steadily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Although Turkey generally maintained a distant relationship with much of the Arab world, it was cautious about being seen as too close to Israel, which could put its ties with the wider Middle East under pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Domestic political concerns also existed, as strong ties with Israel could cause resentment among more religious parts of Turkish society that favored the Palestinian cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Consequently, Turkish governments often took a step back during periods of heightened tension in the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

The "golden age" of [[history_of_alliance_and_conflict_between_turkey_and_israel | Turkish-Israel relations]] occurred in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. As the Cold War ended and steps were taken towards Israeli-Palestinian peace, cooperation dramatically increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. [[turkey_and_israel_diplomatic_relations | Diplomatic relations]] were strengthened in 1991, leading to a free trade agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. The relationship particularly thrived in military and security engagement, including defense industry cooperation and high-profile training agreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

## Deterioration of Relations

The critical turning point came in November 2002, with the Justice and Development Party (AKP), led by Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, winning national elections in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Although the AKP initially affirmed closeness to the West and pursuit of EU membership, Turkish foreign policy began to pivot, focusing more closely on the Arab Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

Initially, this shift was handled carefully to avoid alienating Israel, with Ankara presenting itself as an honest broker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. However, cracks emerged as the Turkish government became increasingly critical of [[israeli_military_actions_and_their_impact_on_turkishisraeli_tensions | Israeli policies towards the Palestinians]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. This gained international attention following a heated exchange between Erdoğan and Israeli President Shimon Peres at the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

The critical moment arrived in May 2010 when Israeli commandos raided a convoy of Turkish ships attempting to deliver aid to Gaza, which was under Israeli blockade, resulting in nine deaths and over 30 injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. In response, Turkey withdrew its ambassador to Israel, shattering the once-solid relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Erdoğan became an increasingly vocal critic of Israel on the international stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

## Attempts at Rapprochement and Subsequent Collapse

In March 2013, US President Obama arranged a call between Erdoğan and Benjamin Netanyahu, leading to an agreement to restore [[turkey_and_israel_diplomatic_relations | diplomatic relations]] in return for an Israeli apology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Three years later, the Israeli government agreed to pay $20 million in compensation to the families of those killed in the raid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

However, this progress was short-lived. In May 2018, [[turkey_and_israel_diplomatic_relations | relations nosedived again]] after heavy fighting in Gaza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. Despite this, another effort to rebuild relations began in January 2022, resulting in the first direct phone call between the Turkish and Israeli foreign ministers in 13 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Weeks later, Erdoğan welcomed the Israeli president to Ankara, seen as a significant breakthrough, discussing expanding trade and energy cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

This thaw was also brief, collapsing again just 18 months later, setting the stage for the current confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. The latest deterioration was spurred by Hamas's attack on Israel on October 7, 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. As Israel retaliated with a full-scale military campaign in Gaza, Erdoğan became increasingly outspoken, accusing Israeli leaders of committing war crimes and genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. This culminated in Turkey severing [[turkey_and_israel_diplomatic_relations | diplomatic ties]] with Israel in November 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

## Current Confrontation: Turkey's Role in Syria and Israeli Response

Beyond Gaza, a critical development emerged weeks later with the overthrow of the 50-year Assad regime in Syria by the Islamist HTS militia and its Turkish-backed allies, positioning Turkey as a key international actor in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. Turkey also maintains a military presence in northern Syria, viewing the de facto autonomous Syrian Kurdish region as a threat to peace and security in adjoining Kurdish areas of southeast Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

Seeing the expanding [[turkeys_role_in_syria_and_its_effects_on_relations_with_israel | Turkish role in Syria]] as a substantial security threat, Israel carried out airstrikes on April 2 against several Syrian military installations, including two air bases Ankara was reportedly considering for its forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. Israel explicitly stated the attacks were directed at Turkey, accusing Ankara of playing a negative role in Syria and attempting to make the country a Turkish protectorate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. The Israeli defense minister warned the new government in Damascus of a heavy price if it allowed hostile forces to be stationed in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

## Will Turkey and Israel Go to War?

Given their poor relations in recent years and Israel's clear stance on [[turkeys_role_in_syria_and_its_effects_on_relations_with_israel | Turkish encroachment in Syria]], the two countries appear to be on a dangerous collision course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

### Potential for Limited Conflict

While a confrontation is dangerous, there is a strong chance it will remain limited to Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. Neither state will want to escalate it into a conflict on their national territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Armed confrontations between Turkish and Israeli forces could occur in Syria, or they might focus on using local proxies and cyber attacks for indirect conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

### De-escalation Efforts

Both countries have taken steps to avoid unwanted escalation. News reports indicate that Azerbaijan hosted talks between Turkish and Israeli officials, designed to set up a deconfliction mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. Although the Turkish foreign minister insists these are technical talks limited to operational coordination and do not signify a broader normalization of ties or re-establishment of [[turkey_and_israel_diplomatic_relations | diplomatic relations]], this is viewed as a welcome sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

### Broader Implications and Concerns

Despite some reassuring signs, complacency is unwarranted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. Even if fighting remains limited to Syria, the broader international implications could be enormous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. A confrontation, particularly if fought with local proxies, could plunge Syria back into chaos, potentially reigniting the civil war and drawing in other regional actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

Given that seemingly localized situations can easily escalate, and both Israel and Turkey are significant regional military powers, the potential for a disastrous escalation is obvious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. Furthermore, observers are questioning whether the United States, typically expected to manage such a crisis, would have the capability to act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. For all these reasons, the growing tensions between Turkey and Israel, once close allies turned regional foes, are now viewed with deep concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.

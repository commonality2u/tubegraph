In October 2023, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali sparked fears of a new conflict in the Horn of Africa by calling for Ethiopia to have access to the strategically vital Red Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This led neighbouring Eritrea to put its forces on alert, raising the prospect of a return to war between the two countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Although the immediate threat appeared to subside, concerns remain about a potential future conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Ethiopia has since insisted it has no hostile intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Geographical and Demographic Context

Geography plays a significant role in international relations, especially for landlocked states that often feel vulnerable and dependent on their neighbours for access to the sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. [[economic_and_strategic_interests_in_the_horn_of_africa | Strategic sea access]] is considered a vital national interest for many such states, sometimes leading to conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

Ethiopia and Eritrea are located in the Horn of Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   **Ethiopia**:
    *   The world's 26th largest country by area (1.1 million sq km) and Africa's 10th largest state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
    *   Landlocked, it borders Djibouti, Somalia, Kenya, South Sudan, Sudan, Eritrea, and the internationally unrecognised [[impact_of_somalilands_unrecognized_status_on_regional_stability | Somaliland]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
    *   With 120 million inhabitants, Ethiopia is Africa's second most populous country after Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
    *   Tigrayans constitute 7-8% of its population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Eritrea**:
    *   Located northeast of Ethiopia, with a long coastline on the Red Sea, a crucial strategic waterway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
    *   Its area is 125,000 sq km, making it the world's 97th largest country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
    *   Borders Djibouti, Sudan, and Ethiopia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
    *   Its population is around 3.6 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
    *   Over half of Eritrea's population is Tigrayan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## Historical Background

The shared history of Ethiopia and Eritrea dates back to antiquity, including the Kingdom of Axum, which encompassed present-day Eritrea and northern Ethiopia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### European Colonial Expansion
In the 19th century, Italy established a trading outpost in Eritrea in 1869, eventually creating the Colony of Eritrea and taking control of [[historical_tensions_and_conflicts_between_ethiopia_and_somalia | Somaliland]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Ethiopia, despite resisting European colonisation, fell under Italian control in 1936 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

### Post-World War II Status
Italian control was short-lived, ending in 1941 when British and Ethiopian forces defeated Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Ethiopia regained independence and became a UN founding member, while Eritrea came under British trusteeship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

Initially, Eritrea was expected to exercise self-determination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. However, deep divisions emerged: Muslim Eritreans favoured independence, while most Christians, primarily Ethiopian Orthodox, preferred union with Ethiopia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Ethiopia, desperate for Red Sea access, also sought this union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

The UN General Assembly, unable to agree on an outcome, presented three options: annexation by Ethiopia, a federation between Ethiopia and Eritrea, or a 10-year trust territory period before independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. The General Assembly chose the second option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

### The Federation and Eritrean War of Independence
On September 15, 1952, the Federation of Ethiopia and Eritrea was created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. This union was contentious, with Ethiopia viewing itself as the senior partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Resentment grew in Eritrea, leading to the Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF) launching an uprising against Ethiopian rule in September 1961 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. Ethiopia responded by dissolving the Federation and annexing Eritrea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. The ELF continued its campaign in what became known as the Eritrean War of Independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

### Fall of Haile Selassie and Rebel Alliances
The overthrow of Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie by a Marxist military coup on September 12, 1974, changed the dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. The ELF split, and the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF) emerged, allying with other groups fighting the new regime, most significantly the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front (TPLF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

As the Soviet Union collapsed and the Ethiopian government lost its key benefactor, rebel forces, including the TPLF and EPLF, gained the upper hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. In May 1991, they took control of Addis Ababa, ousting the military government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

## Eritrean Independence and Post-Independence Tensions

The overthrow of the military regime transformed Eritrea's fortunes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. The EPLF announced an independence referendum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Ethiopian parties and national communities agreed that Eritrea should not be forced to remain part of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. In April 1993, with UN support, Eritrea held a referendum where 99.8% voted for statehood on a 98% turnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. On May 28, 1993, Eritrea became the 183rd member of the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

Despite Ethiopia becoming landlocked after Eritrea's independence, initial relations appeared good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

### The Eritrean-Ethiopian War (1998-2000)
Problems soon emerged, primarily centered on their shared border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Eritrea claimed territory along the entire boundary, with particular contention over parts of the Ethiopian province of Tigray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. The TPLF, dominating the new Ethiopian government, fiercely rejected Eritrea's demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

After several years of growing tensions, war broke out on May 6, 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. The conflict was brutal, causing up to 100,000 deaths and massive displacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. After two years of fighting, Ethiopia gained the upper hand, leading to a UN-monitored ceasefire in June 2000 and a formal peace deal six months later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

As part of the peace deal, a boundary commission was created in cooperation with the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. In 2002, the commission awarded a small Tigrayan village to Eritrea, which sparked anger in Ethiopia, leading the Ethiopian government to reject the outcome despite agreeing to be bound by the decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. This ensured high tensions and occasional violent clashes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

## Shifting Alliances and the Tigray Conflict

Everything changed in April 2018 with the election of Abiy Ahmed Ali as Ethiopia's Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. An ethnic Oromo, he began to push back against entrenched Tigrayan dominance in Ethiopian politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Two months into his term, he announced that his government accepted the Border Commission's decision, earning widespread praise and the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. This led to an immediate thawing of relations with Eritrea, including a face-to-face meeting between Abiy Ahmed and Eritrea's long-standing President, Isaias Afwerki <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

### Outrage in Tigray and the [[international_and_regional_implications_of_the_tigray_conflict | Tigray Conflict]] (2020-2022)
The decision to accept the border ruling caused outrage in Tigray, where the TPLF still dominated local politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. Tensions escalated in 2020 when Tigray proceeded with its regional elections despite Ethiopia postponing national elections due to the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. With neither side recognizing the other's legitimacy, Abiy Ahmed sent the Ethiopian National Defense Force into Tigray in November 2020 to retake control and force the TPLF from power, leading to [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | civil war in Ethiopia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

Abiy Ahmed's improved relations with Eritrea paid off, as Afwerki, deeply hostile to the TPLF, offered support to Addis Ababa, providing sanctuary to Ethiopian troops fleeing into Eritrea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. The TPLF then launched rocket attacks on Eritrea following reports that Eritrea allowed Ethiopian forces to launch attacks from its territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. Within months, reports emerged that Eritrea had sent forces to assist the Ethiopian Army in Tigray, leading to claims of atrocities, war crimes, and possibly crimes against humanity by Eritrean troops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

Despite the joint cooperation, Tigrayan forces initially seemed to be staging a comeback, even appearing poised to seize Addis Ababa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. However, the tide turned again in 2022, with Ethiopian troops, supported by Eritrean forces, pushing the Tigrayans back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. With the Ethiopian Army on the verge of retaking Mekelle, the Tigrayan capital, the African Union brokered a peace deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. This led to the TPLF forces surrendering and demobilizing, as Ethiopia reasserted control over the province <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. In return, Tigray was promised proper representation in national institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

## Renewed Concerns (October 2023)

Renewed concerns about a return to war are driven by several factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. Eritrea was notably excluded from the peace talks that ended the [[international_and_regional_implications_of_the_tigray_conflict | Tigray Conflict]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>, and there are claims that Eritrean troops still remain in Tigray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. These issues have caused relations between Asmara and Addis Ababa to sour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

The immediate cause for concern was Abiy Ahmed's speech on October 15, 2023, where he stated that Ethiopia, one of Africa's fastest-developing economies, should assert its rights to access the Red Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. Given that many Ethiopians still regard Eritrea as a historic part of their country, this immediately sparked fears of a potential Ethiopian invasion of Eritrea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>. Eritrean forces moved close to the border, and Ethiopia responded in kind, prompting concerns of imminent conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

However, these fears appeared to be a false alarm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. Ten days later, Abiy Ahmed sought to alleviate concerns, insisting that Ethiopia would not pursue its interests by force or attack "its fellow brothers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.

Despite these denials, the long history of [[ethnic_tensions_and_federalism_in_ethiopia | tensions between the two countries]] and Ethiopia's persistent wish for maritime access leave many wondering whether Ethiopia and Eritrea might still be heading towards another war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

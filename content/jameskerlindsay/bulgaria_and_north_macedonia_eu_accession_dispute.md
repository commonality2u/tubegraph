In June 2021, Bulgaria once again blocked the start of European Union accession talks with [[North Macedonia and Greece peace agreement | North Macedonia]] over a long-standing dispute concerning their history and language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This issue, despite being widely seen as petty and incomprehensible, highlights the significant role identity issues play in international relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Understanding the Concept of Nationhood

Unlike a state, which grants citizenship, the concept of a nation is more fluid, defined by an idea of people linked through shared language, history, and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Sometimes, a single nation may reside across two states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. At other times, people who once shared historical bonds may come to view themselves as entirely distinct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. The dispute between Bulgaria and [[historical and cultural identity issues between bulgaria and north macedonia | North Macedonia]] serves as a prominent contemporary example where one group views another as part of a single nation, while the latter sees itself as separate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This disagreement has increasingly disrupted [[impact of north macedonias political changes on eu integration | North Macedonia's path towards EU membership]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Geography and Demographics

Bulgaria and [[recent political developments in north macedonia | North Macedonia]] are located in Southeast Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Bulgaria, with an area of 110,000 square kilometres (around 40,000 square miles), is the 103rd largest UN member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. To its west lies [[recent political developments in north macedonia | North Macedonia]], which spans 26,000 square kilometres (10,000 square miles) and is the 145th largest UN member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

Bulgaria has a population of approximately 7 million, while [[recent political developments in north macedonia | North Macedonia]], which last held a census in 2002, is estimated to have about 2.1 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Both countries are predominantly Slavic-speaking Christian Orthodox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, but also have significant non-Slavic Muslim minorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Ethnic Turks constitute about nine percent of Bulgaria's population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, whereas ethnic Albanians are thought to comprise around 35 percent of [[recent political developments in north macedonia | North Macedonia]]'s population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Historical Background of the Identity Dispute

The core of the dispute lies in increasingly divergent interpretations of the past and different ethnolinguistic origins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

### Decline of the Ottoman Empire and Bulgarian Aspirations

The story largely begins with the decline of the Ottoman Empire in the late 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. The Treaty of Berlin in 1878 established the Principality of Bulgaria as an autonomous state within the Ottoman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. From its inception, the nascent Bulgarian state claimed several neighbouring areas still under Ottoman rule, including Thrace and Macedonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. In the 1890s, the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (VMRO) emerged, dedicated to the liberation of the Macedonian region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

### Balkan Wars and World Wars

Macedonia was also claimed by neighbouring Greece and Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. In 1912, Bulgaria, having gained full independence, allied with Greece, Serbia, and Montenegro to expel the Ottomans from Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. While Bulgaria gained access to the Mediterranean by capturing Thrace, it only acquired a small part of Macedonia, with the majority taken by Greek and Serb forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

During World War I, Bulgaria sided with Germany and briefly captured the Serbian-held part of Macedonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, but Serbia retook the region in September 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. This area then became part of the newly established Kingdom of Yugoslavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. Bulgaria maintained its claims, again occupying most of Serbian Macedonia and parts of Greek Macedonia during World War II, allied with Nazi Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. However, this control was also short-lived as Bulgaria switched sides towards the war's end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

### Emergence of a Distinct Macedonian Identity

World War II marked a turning point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. Rather than being reintegrated into Serbia, the northern part of Macedonia gained autonomy, becoming the Socialist Republic of Macedonia, one of the six constituent republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. In subsequent years, a conscious effort was made to foster a wholly distinct Macedonian identity, emphasizing a separate history, language, and culture from Bulgaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. By the 1970s, Macedonian, though mutually intelligible with Bulgarian, was officially registered as a separate language by the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

## North Macedonia's Independence and the Greek Name Dispute

This sense of nationhood became prominent with Yugoslavia's disintegration in the early 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. On September 8, 1991, Socialist Macedonia overwhelmingly voted to become the sovereign state of the Republic of Macedonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

> [!info] The Name Dispute with Greece
> This new country immediately sparked a [[historical_background_of_north_macedonia_and_greece_name_dispute | dispute with neighbouring Greece]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Athens accused the Republic of Macedonia of harbouring territorial claims against its own region of Macedonia and blocked its path to membership in organizations like the European Union until a new name was agreed upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. After nearly 30 years of UN mediation, Athens and Skopje reached the [[north_macedonia_and_greece_peace_agreement | Prespa Agreement]] in June 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. The country officially became the Republic of [[recent political developments in north macedonia | North Macedonia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. This agreement was widely welcomed, as it meant [[recent political developments in north macedonia | North Macedonia]] could finally open EU accession talks, a crucial step for stabilization in the Western Balkans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

## The Bulgarian Identity Dispute Escalates

However, the jubilation was short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Almost immediately after the issue with Greece was resolved, a new identity dispute, this time with Bulgaria, gained international attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

Unlike Greece, Bulgaria did not dispute the country's name or the existence of a Macedonian state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. In fact, Bulgaria was the first country to recognize the new Republic of Macedonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Instead, Bulgaria disputed the existence of a separate Macedonian nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

> [!info] Bulgarian View
> Bulgaria asserts that the Slavic population of Macedonia is part of the wider Bulgarian nation, and the Macedonian language is merely a dialect of Bulgarian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

Relations were further strained by a clause in the Macedonian Constitution that allowed the country to protect the interests of Macedonians living in neighbouring states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Bulgaria viewed this as a potential pretext for interference in its domestic affairs or even a claim to its territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

### Attempts at Resolution and Renewed Tensions

In 1999, the two countries signed an 11-point joint declaration that appeared to settle the matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Both sides formally renounced territorial claims, and Macedonia declared that its constitution could not be interpreted as a basis for interfering in Bulgaria's internal affairs to defend non-Macedonian citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Bulgaria seemingly settled the language issue by explicitly acknowledging that the declaration was concluded in both Bulgarian and Macedonian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

Despite this agreement, tensions persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. A nationalist government in Macedonia intensified tensions with both Bulgaria and Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. For instance, the Museum of the Macedonian Struggle depicted Bulgaria in a negative light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. The countries also engaged in an increasingly bitter dispute over the national identity of key VMRO members, such as Gotse Delchev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

After Bulgaria joined the EU in 2007, it began threatening to block [[recent political developments in north macedonia | North Macedonia]]'s EU accession talks unless these differences were resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. The situation appeared to ease with a more moderate Macedonian government taking power in 2017, leading to the signing of a friendship treaty on August 1, 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. This treaty reaffirmed territorial integrity and established a joint commission to address historical controversies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

However, little progress was made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. In October 2019, the Bulgarian Government issued over 20 demands that had to be met before it would permit EU accession talks with [[recent political developments in north macedonia | North Macedonia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. It also advised the European Union to refer to "the official language of the Republic of [[recent political developments in north macedonia | North Macedonia]]" instead of "Macedonian language" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

### Bulgaria's Veto and International Criticism

A year later, amidst looming elections and growing protests, Sofia carried out its threat and vetoed the start of membership negotiations with [[recent political developments in north macedonia | North Macedonia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. This move, seen as driven by narrow nationalist reasons, was heavily criticized by Bulgaria's European partners, who were incensed by the introduction of another identity dispute after the [[prespa_agreement_controversy | Prespa Agreement controversy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

The decision was also met with anger in Skopje <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. Nikola Dimitrov, the deputy prime minister, stated:
> "Who we are is our business. It's a question for the Macedonian people. We think that this should by no means be a precondition for our European future." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>

Despite a new caretaker administration in Bulgaria after a general election, the stance remained unchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. A last-minute negotiation attempt in June 2021 failed, and on June 22, 2021, Bulgaria again blocked the opening of formal EU accession talks with [[recent political developments in north macedonia | North Macedonia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

Bulgaria has since lost the public relations battle over the issue, with EU patience reportedly exhausted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. As one European diplomat remarked, "everybody is fed up with Bulgaria's stance on [[recent political developments in north macedonia | North Macedonia]]. It's incomprehensible, indefensible and destabilises the Western Balkans. Bulgaria is losing friends at high speed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

## The Core of the Dispute

The dispute raises complex questions about national identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. While Bulgaria once regarded Macedonia as an integral part of its territory and made repeated efforts to seize it, it now seemingly accepts the existence of a sovereign state of [[recent political developments in north macedonia | North Macedonia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. However, it appears unable to accept the notion of a distinct Macedonian national identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

Sofia's view is that Macedonian identity only emerged as part of a deliberate Yugoslav policy to demonize Bulgaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>, asserting that Slavic Macedonians are "really and truly Bulgarians" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. Conversely, Macedonians contend that, regardless of Bulgaria's acceptance, they possess their own separate national identity that must be acknowledged and respected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. Ironically, Bulgaria's current actions are doing more than anything to cement that very Macedonian identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

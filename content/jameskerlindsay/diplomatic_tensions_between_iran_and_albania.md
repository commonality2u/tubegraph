While international attention has often focused on internal demonstrations in Iran, an important development involving [[Irans cyber attacks on Albania | a series of destructive cyber attacks orchestrated by Iran's intelligence services on Albania's critical infrastructure]] largely passed unnoticed in July and September 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. These attacks led to the severance of diplomatic relations between Tirana and Tehran, new sanctions imposed by the United States on Iran, and widespread condemnation from NATO members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The incident raises significant questions about the new era of cyber warfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## The Rise of Cyber Warfare

Traditional interstate conflict, involving conventional weaponry, appears increasingly out of touch with contemporary realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. While territorial wars can still be fought with bombs and bullets, as seen in Ukraine, a new mode of conflict is emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. [[Cyber warfare]] has become a serious challenge to peace and security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. The damage caused by cyber attacks can often be more extensive and costly than armed attacks; for example, a cyber attack can disable an entire power network, whereas a missile might only destroy a single power station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. The US government described the attacks on Albania as a "troubling precedent" for cyberspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.

## An Unlikely Conflict: Iran and Albania

A conflict between Iran and Albania seems improbable given their geographical and cultural differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

*   **Iran:**
    *   Located between the Middle East and Central Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
    *   The 17th largest member of the United Nations, with a population close to 90 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
    *   Predominantly Muslim, with approximately 90-95% adhering to the Shia branch of Islam, in contrast to the Sunni Islam prevalent in much of the Muslim world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Albania:**
    *   Located three thousand kilometers away in Southeast Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
    *   Ranks 140th among the 193 UN members, with a population of about 2.8 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
    *   Also largely Muslim and follows the Sunni branch of the faith, but is known for being highly secular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

## Historical Context: Iran's Diplomatic Shift

The story of the tensions between these two nations begins with the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

### Pre-Revolution Iran

Persia (Iran) became an important Western ally due to its long border with the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. However, the Shah, Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, oversaw a corrupt and brutal regime, with secret police suppressing dissent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Opposition grew across the political spectrum, uniting religious conservatives, radicals, and communist groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. By the late 1970s, mass protests, strikes, and armed insurgency led to the Shah fleeing the country in January 1979 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

### The Islamic Revolution

Days after the Shah's departure, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, an exiled cleric, returned to Tehran to become the Supreme Leader of the newly established Islamic Republic of Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

The revolution drastically transformed the country:
*   **Internal Changes:** A theocratic political system was introduced, Islamic law was strictly enforced, and all opposition was purged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
*   **Foreign Policy Shift:**
    *   Long-standing ties with Israel were severed, with calls for the destruction of the Jewish state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
    *   Fears grew that the new regime intended to export its revolution, raising tensions with Gulf monarchies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
    *   This was a leading factor in Iraq's decision to attack Iran in September 1980, sparking a bloody eight-year war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
    *   Relations with the West, especially the United States, dramatically worsened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Months after the revolution, the US embassy in Tehran was stormed, leading to a 15-month hostage crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. Tensions grew between Iran and what it termed "the Great Satan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
    *   In 1983, Washington held Iran responsible for bomb attacks on US targets in Lebanon, leading to Iran's formal designation as a state sponsor of terrorism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
    *   Despite a brief easing of tensions in the late 1990s, relations deteriorated again, with President George W. Bush labeling Iran part of an "Axis of Evil" alongside North Korea and Iraq in January 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

## The People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (MEK)

The US invasion of Iraq in 2003 brought a new element to the story: the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (MEK) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

### Origins and Opposition

MEK emerged in the mid-1960s as part of the opposition to the Shah's rule, blending militant Islam, radical Marxism, and fierce anti-Americanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. They became a leading opponent of the regime and Western presence, even attacking US citizens in Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

### Post-Revolution and Iraq

However, MEK's relations with the new theocratic regime collapsed immediately after the Revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Thousands of members were rounded up, and the leadership fled first to France, then to Iraq a few years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Iraq, engaged in war with Iran, welcomed MEK, providing them with a large military base, Camp Ashraf, 65 kilometers from the Iranian border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Even after the Iran-Iraq War, MEK assisted Iraqi forces in suppressing Kurdish insurgents and continued their campaign against Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

### Terrorist Designation and Relocation

By the late 1990s, MEK came under international pressure. As part of rapprochement with Iran and with Saddam Hussein's Iraq designated a pariah state, Washington and other Western countries listed MEK as a terrorist organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

However, the 2003 US invasion of Iraq changed MEK's fortunes as the Bush Administration saw a chance to use them to undermine Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Despite its terrorist designation, MEK received formal US protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. When Washington handed Iraq over to a new administration with ties to Iran, MEK came under attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. The US revoked MEK's terrorist designation and sought to relocate the group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

### Albania's Role

Most countries were reluctant to accept thousands of trained insurgents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. At this point, Albania entered the story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Staunchly pro-American due to US support for [[political_and_legal_challenges_to_kosovoalbania_unification | Kosovo's independence from Serbia]], and having joined NATO in 2009, Tirana agreed to accept MEK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. Between 2014 and 2016, several thousand MEK members were airlifted to Albania, where they acquired land near the capital and established a new base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

Unable to maintain an armed insurgency, MEK switched tactics, setting up "troll farms" to lead an online campaign against the Iranian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. This online activity appears to have provoked [[Irans cyber attacks on Albania | Iran's recent attacks against Albania]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

## The Cyber Attacks

Planning for [[Irans cyber attacks on Albania | the cyber attacks]] began in early 2021 with Iranian infiltration of Albanian government systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. Significant reconnaissance followed in May and June 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

On July 15, 2022, a group named "Homeland Justice," identified as an Iranian state cyber actor, launched a ransomware attack that included anti-MEK messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. As Albanian authorities responded, a wave of destructive malware was unleashed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

### Impact of the Attacks

The attacks caused considerable disruption across Albanian government systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>:
*   Affected critical government services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   Disrupted medical appointments and school databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.
*   Shut down websites of the Prime Minister's office and the Albanian Parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   The government's main online portal, "e-Albania," was also shut down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

In September, another attack focused on the police computer network, bringing down border control systems and causing large queues at entry points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

### Albania's Response and International Reaction

The Albanian government, through Prime Minister Edi Rama, revealed the full extent of the attacks and directly blamed the Islamic Republic of Iran, calling it an act of state aggression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. In response, Albania severed diplomatic relations with Iran and expelled all Iranian diplomats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

While Iran denied the allegations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>, Albania's allies quickly offered support:
*   **United States:** Condemned the attacks as a "troubling precedent for cyberspace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. The US Treasury imposed sanctions against the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and its minister for "malign cyber activities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
*   **NATO:** Issued a statement strongly condemning the attacks against an ally and promised to support Albania's efforts to strengthen its cyber defense capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. However, Albania did not invoke Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty (collective defense), with Prime Minister Rama indicating a desire not to escalate the matter further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

## Implications for Contemporary Conflict

The [[Irans cyber attacks on Albania | Iran cyber attack on Albania]], despite receiving little international attention, raises important questions about the evolution of conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>.

### Responses to Cyber Warfare

The preferred reaction to such attacks appears to be low-key condemnation, sanctions, and possibly cyber retaliation, with little appetite for conventional counter-attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. While some argue online attacks should be viewed separately from traditional armed attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>, cyber attacks can inflict as much, if not more, damage than conventional weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. This raises concerns that the low-key response might allow states to cause mayhem with relative impunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

### Supporting Dissident Groups

The attack also highlights the implications of supporting dissident groups in the contemporary era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. Albania was attacked because it provided sanctuary for MEK, a significant Iranian dissident group with a history of conventional and online insurgency against Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. This fits into the historical pattern of states retaliating against countries that allow their territory to be used by armed insurgencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. While some may argue Albania is right to host MEK given Iran's history of sponsoring terrorism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>, such support carries significant, sometimes distant, risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

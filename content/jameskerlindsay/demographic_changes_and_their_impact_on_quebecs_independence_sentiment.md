Demographic shifts are identified as a significant factor influencing the decline in support for [[Quebec independence movement | independence]] in Quebec <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

## Age-Related Trends
Unlike many regions where pro-independence sentiment is stronger among younger populations, in Quebec, the opposite trend is observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. Those who support separation tend to be over 55 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Younger generations appear more comfortable with a dual Canadian and Francophone identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. Polling indicates that only about a quarter of young people would vote for [[Quebec independence movement | independence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. This suggests that support for [[Quebec independence movement | independence]] may continue to decline in the coming years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

## Impact of Immigration
Immigration is another crucial demographic factor influencing the [[Quebec independence movement | independence movement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. The number of English and non-French speakers is projected to increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. Statistics Canada forecasts that the Francophone population in Quebec will decrease to between 69% and 72% by 2036 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. This raises questions about whether this demographic shift will dilute support for [[Quebec independence movement | independence]] or, conversely, foster a renewed sense of Francophone nativism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

While the ambition for statehood appears likely to decline in the years ahead, it is still considered too soon to definitively write off the [[Quebec independence movement | independence movement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. Polling suggests that almost half of Quebecers believe the sovereignty movement will return one day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

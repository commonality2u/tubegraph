International attention often focuses on Turkish President [[recep_tayyip_erdogans_political_strategy_and_future | Recep Tayyip Erdogan]], particularly during events like the NATO summit in Vilnius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While many questioned his stance on Sweden's NATO membership, he surprisingly linked it to Turkey's long-stalled European Union membership talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Although he eventually accepted Sweden's membership, his motives for raising the EU issue prompted curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This recent move highlights a broader shift in Turkey's relationship with its Western partners, which has become increasingly distant over the last decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. While European leaders bear some responsibility, much of this strain is attributed to [[erdogans_policies_and_influence | Erdogan's policies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Historical Context of Turkey's Western Ties

Turkey's relationship with Europe spans centuries, dating back to the Ottoman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. After the First World War, the Republic of Turkey was proclaimed on October 29, 1923, under General Mustafa Kamal (Ataturk) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. From its inception, the new country oriented itself towards Europe and the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Ataturk implemented radical social reforms to minimize Islam's role, introduced a Latin script, and took other measures to move closer to Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

This Western orientation continued after Ataturk's death in 1938 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Turkey became one of the first members of the Council of Europe in 1949 and joined NATO in 1952 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. A significant step was taken in 1963 with an association agreement with the European Economic Community (EEC), the precursor to the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. However, Turkey's path to full membership was hindered by internal political instability, military coups, and external tensions with Greece over the Aegean Sea and the 1974 invasion of Cyprus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

## [[erdogans_rise_to_power_and_political_career | Erdogan's Rise and Initial EU Rapprochement]]

By the late 1990s, the situation began to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Although Turkey's EU application was rejected in 1997, a massive earthquake in 1999 led to rapprochement with Greece, which then dropped its objections to Turkish membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. The most profound change occurred in November 2002 when the Justice and Development Party (AKP), led by [[recep_tayyip_erdogans_political_strategy_and_future | Recep Tayyip Erdogan]], won the general elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

The new [[erdogans_administration_and_changing_political_outlook | Erdogan government]] prioritized EU membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. This included continuing rapprochement with Greece and supporting a UN plan to reunite Cyprus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. Despite the UN effort failing, the EU rewarded Turkey's constructive role, agreeing to open membership negotiations in 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. In the following years, Turkey made progress, reforming its internal politics, reducing military power, and opening 16 of 33 chapters of the *acquis communautaire* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## Shift Towards Authoritarianism

Despite a promising start, problems began to emerge by the end of the decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. [[recep_tayyip_erdogans_political_strategy_and_future | Erdogan]], who began as a reforming democrat, became increasingly authoritarian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. This was evident in May 2013, when mass protests erupted after a peaceful protest in Istanbul's Gezi Park was cleared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Although [[recep_tayyip_erdogans_political_strategy_and_future | Erdogan]] retained control, he tightened his grip on power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

A significant turning point occurred in July 2016, following an attempted coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. [[recep_tayyip_erdogans_political_strategy_and_future | Erdogan]] launched a massive crackdown against political opponents, leading to mass purges of those suspected of holding critical views of the [[erdogans_administration_and_changing_political_outlook | AKP administration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Hundreds of thousands were dismissed from civil service, the judiciary, military, and academia, and tens of thousands were jailed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. To further consolidate his power, [[recep_tayyip_erdogans_political_strategy_and_future | Erdogan]] also changed the constitution, establishing a presidential system that significantly increased his personal authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. This series of events represents a significant shift in [[the_transformation_of_turkey_under_erdogans_leadership | Turkey under Erdogan's leadership]].

## [[erdogans_impact_on_turkish_domestic_and_foreign_policy | Impact on Western Relations]]

These [[erdogans_policies_and_influence | policies]] had a considerable impact on Turkey's relationship with the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. EU membership talks halted, as Turkey was deemed no longer to meet the democratic criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. EU-Turkey relations were further strained by issues like the 2015 migrant crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

Relations with the United States and NATO also became increasingly difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Ankara accused the US of harboring Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkey blamed for the attempted coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Turkey's growing ties with Russia and its decision to purchase a Russian-made anti-aircraft system further concerned the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. Even Turkey's place in the Council of Europe was questioned due to arrests and indefinite detentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. The country also faced criticism for withdrawing from the Istanbul Convention on women's rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. These [[challenges_and_controversies_during_erdogans_governance | challenges and controversies]] defined a new period of foreign policy.

## Recent Strategies and Shifting Stance

The war in Ukraine brought tensions to a head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Unlike the EU and US, Ankara refused to impose sanctions on Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. While Turkey claimed to act as an intermediary, brokering a deal to export Ukrainian grain, many saw it as further proof of [[recep_tayyip_erdogans_political_strategy_and_future | Erdogan]]'s untrustworthiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

A significant moment arrived in May 2022 when Sweden and Finland applied to join NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. Ankara initially announced it would not accept their membership, citing their failure to address Kurdish terrorism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. While [[recep_tayyip_erdogans_political_strategy_and_future | Erdogan]] eventually relented on Finnish membership, he held firm on Sweden, despite significant anger in NATO circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

### The Vilnius Summit and Its Aftermath

As NATO leaders prepared for their summit in Vilnius, Lithuania, [[recep_tayyip_erdogans_political_strategy_and_future | Erdogan]] suddenly linked Sweden's NATO bid to Turkey's EU membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. However, following a meeting with the Swedish prime minister and NATO Secretary General on the summit's first day, [[recep_tayyip_erdogans_political_strategy_and_future | Erdogan]] agreed to forward Sweden's application to the Turkish Parliament for ratification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

The EU was unlikely to restart membership talks after such an act of "political blackmail" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. [[recep_tayyip_erdogans_political_strategy_and_future | Erdogan]]'s quick turnaround is partly explained by the immediate political context: he had just secured re-election in a brutal campaign where he played the nationalist card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

However, the primary driver for this shift is Turkey's severe economic crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. Facing dangerously low foreign currency reserves and a looming financial crisis, [[recep_tayyip_erdogans_political_strategy_and_future | Erdogan]] is now looking to his Western partners for support, as traditional Gulf Arab supporters appear less willing to prop up the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

This pivot has led to dramatic moves, including support for Ukrainian NATO membership and handing over Ukrainian prisoners of war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. These actions are already yielding dividends, such as high-profile meetings with EU officials and President Biden, and the US Administration's willingness to approve the sale of F-16 fighter jets to Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. There is also the hope that Western partners will be more willing to assist Turkey if the economy deteriorates further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

## Future of EU Accession and Western Ties

The possibility of renewing EU accession talks is highly unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. There are too many serious problems, including Turkey's outstanding issues with neighbors and, crucially, [[recep_tayyip_erdogans_political_strategy_and_future | Erdogan]]'s authoritarianism, which means Turkey does not meet the democratic requirements for membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. Furthermore, there is no appetite for Turkish membership within the EU, neither among leaders nor the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

Interestingly, there's a strong argument that [[recep_tayyip_erdogans_political_strategy_and_future | Erdogan]] himself is not keen on actual EU membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. While he values the validation that comes with membership talks and the ability to argue that the process is intact, he likely would not want to implement the necessary changes to join the Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

This creates a peculiar dynamic where both sides were content to leave talks in limbo when relations were strained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. If relations improve, both sides will want to maintain good working relations but avoid seriously discussing a full restart of negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. After meeting [[recep_tayyip_erdogans_political_strategy_and_future | Erdogan]], European Council President Charles Michel's suggestion of a "renewed relationship" carefully avoided any mention of membership talks, indicating this mutual understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

Despite the significant steps taken at the NATO Summit, few Western leaders believe this marks a genuine new era in relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. For such a shift, Ankara would need to work significantly on rebuilding trust and addressing the country's political and human rights shortcomings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. The current charm offensive by [[recep_tayyip_erdogans_political_strategy_and_future | Erdogan]] suggests the depth of Turkey's financial problems, leaving Western leaders wondering about the cost of this "rediscovered friendship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

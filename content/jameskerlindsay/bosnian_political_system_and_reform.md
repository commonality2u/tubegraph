Bosnia and Herzegovina is a country noted for its natural beauty, but it faces significant internal challenges, including deep divisions and an unwieldy, dysfunctional political system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A quarter-century after the peace agreement that ended its brutal war, the country remains deeply divided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. There have been repeated calls for fundamental changes, including the abolition of [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]], one of the country's two territorial entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

## Background

Bosnia and Herzegovina is located in southeast Europe, sharing borders with Croatia, Montenegro, and Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. With a population of approximately 3.4 million, its people are divided into three main groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>:
*   **Bosniaks:** The largest group, making up around half of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. Formerly known as Bosnian Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.
*   **Bosnian Serbs:** Around 30% of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.
*   **Bosnian Croats:** Approximately 15% of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.
*   The remaining 3% includes Albanians, Roma, Jews, and other minority communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.

The modern [[ethnic_divisions_in_bosniaherzegovina | history of Bosnia's political instability]] began with the disintegration of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. In March 1992, Bosnia and Herzegovina declared independence, joining the UN months later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. This declaration was rejected by the country's Serbs, who, with support from neighboring Serbia, unilaterally formed their own separatist state, [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. The country then collapsed into a bitter three-way war, as Bosnian Croats also declared independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.

In early 1994, Bosnian Croats and Bosnian Muslims formed a joint entity called the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, composed of 10 self-governing cantons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>. The war with Bosnian Serbs continued until late 1995, when the massacre of 8,000 Bosniak men and boys around Srebrenica prompted international intervention and peace talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.

## The [[dayton_accords_and_bosnias_territorial_arrangements | Dayton Accords]] and its Legacy

On December 14, 1995, the leaders of Bosnia, Croatia, and Serbia signed the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, commonly known as the [[dayton_accords_and_bosnias_territorial_arrangements | Dayton Accords]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. This agreement brought the fractured country back together, but at the cost of a complex political system built around an imbalanced territorial arrangement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

Under the [[dayton_accords_and_bosnias_territorial_arrangements | Dayton Accords]]:
*   [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]], which now covered 49% of Bosnia's territory, gave up its claim to independence and reintegrated into the state alongside the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.
*   Almost all day-to-day issues were handled by the entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.
*   A weak central government dealt with only a few key areas, such as foreign policy, immigration, and customs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>.
*   The central government's structure reflected the entities' power; the joint presidency comprised two members (a Bosniak and a Croat) from the Federation and one Serb from [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>. The Council of Ministers was also divided on a two-to-one ratio between the Federation and [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>.

Initially, the country showed signs of recovery, with reconciliation and reintegration efforts, including the creation of a single military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. However, about a decade later, serious problems emerged as the political structures, which entrenched ethnic identity, came to be seen as discriminatory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>. As attempts at reform failed, positions hardened, leading to increased dysfunction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>.

## Calls for Reform and Competing Visions

The [[dayton_accords_and_bosnias_territorial_arrangements | Dayton Accords]] arrangement appears to be at a breaking point, with repeated calls for reform being rejected, raising warnings of a potential return to conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

### Bosnian Serb Perspective

Bosnian Serb nationalist leaders have openly discussed breaking away to form an independent state or uniting with Serbia, actions banned under the peace deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>. They view [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]] as a legitimate entity guaranteed by international treaties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>. They argue that Bosniaks have increasingly challenged its existence, seeking reasons for its abolition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>. Figures like Milorad Dodik, the Bosnian Serb member of the presidency and former president of [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]], continually threaten a vote on secession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>. Bosnian Serb leaders are perceived by some as intentionally making the country as dysfunctional as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>.

While many Bosnian Serbs acknowledge their leaders talk about secession, most recognize it as unrealistic, believing any attempt to break away would fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>. They understand that such threats are used for political gain by leaders like Dodik <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>. Although they identify as Serbs, many consider Bosnia their homeland, not Serbia, acknowledging that joining Serbia would reduce them to a provincial backwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>. The veneration of wartime leaders is seen by many ordinary Bosnian Serbs as limited to a small section of nationalists, not indicating a desire for a return to conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. Most people remember the war well enough to know that fighting is not the answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.

### Bosnian Croat Perspective

The Bosnian Croats have begun to call for their own entity, similar to [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]], a position increasingly supported by neighboring Croatia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>.

### Bosniak Perspective

In contrast, Bosniaks view the country's problems as a result of excessive decentralization, which they call a 'federation within a federation' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>. They steadfastly reject calls for a new Croatian entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>. Many Bosniaks openly discuss abolishing [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]] (RS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>.

To many Bosniaks, and some external observers, the case for abolishing [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]] is clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>. They point to its problematic origins, which many openly call the product of genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>. They also highlight the difficult relationship between [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]] and the central government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>. The Bosnian Serb leadership is seen as dominated by nationalists who reject the very existence of the Bosnian state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>. There are also worrying signs of ongoing Serb nationalism, including graffiti hero-worshipping convicted wartime leaders and a growing move to deny atrocities like Srebrenica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>. Bosniaks believe that [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]] entrenches the nationalism of the past and hinders the country's progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>.

## The Path Forward

Bosnia is in clear need of reform, as its system of governance has been judged contrary to basic human rights, and the inability to introduce reforms impacts ordinary citizens' lives, leading to stagnation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>. This failure to reform also prevents Bosnia from pursuing EU membership, which could be an important driver for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>.

However, abolishing [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]] is unlikely to be the solution, at least not in the foreseeable future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>. Despite the Bosniak perspective, [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]] as an entity is not inherently the problem, as many countries successfully operate with highly devolved political entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>. In fact, [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]] is arguably more functional as a single entity than the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, with its various units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>.

Crucially, there is no feasible way to abolish [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]] without a return to conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>. Even if Bosnian Serbs do not desire more war, they are unwilling to give up territorial control, and there is no international support for such an idea; foreign diplomats confirm that [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]] is here to stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>.

Nevertheless, the evolution of [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]] as an ethno-national entity entrenches many of Bosnia's problems. It serves as a lightning rod for nationalist politicians on all sides, energizing their communities and creating a destabilizing vicious circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>. Bosnian Serb secessionist talk leads to Bosniak calls for abolition, which in turn reinforces the Bosnian Serb belief that secession is their only option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>.

Abolishing [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]] is not a panacea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>. The first step towards fundamental reform must be to move beyond nationalist talking points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:00">[11:22:00]</a>. This requires Bosniaks and Bosnian Serbs to accept two key principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>:
1.  Bosnia and Herzegovina is a single, indivisible state that is here to stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a>.
2.  [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]] is a legitimate entity that constitutes part of that state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>.

In essence, Bosnian Serbs must cease questioning the territorial integrity of the Bosnian state, and Bosniaks must stop questioning the legitimacy of [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:45:00">[11:45:00]</a>. Only then might the country achieve enough mutual trust to realize more fundamental changes, which will inevitably be built on compromise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>. The challenge lies in finding acceptable compromise rearrangements that can build a sustainable future for Bosnia and Herzegovina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>.

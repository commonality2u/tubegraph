Mongolia has emerged as a critical focal point of competition between regional and international powers, often referred to as a "pivot state" due to its strategic location and economic resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Since 2023, the country has garnered increasing attention from Washington and key European capitals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, with many viewing this as a concerted Western push to strengthen relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Strategic Location and Economic Resources

Mongolia is the world's 18th largest country, covering approximately 1.56 million square kilometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. It is a landlocked state situated on the boundary between Central and East Asia, bordered by Russia to the north and China to the south, east, and west <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

Economically, Mongolia is a significant source of coal, copper, gold, tin, and tungsten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. The mining sector is crucial to its economy, accounting for about a quarter of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 90% of its exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Mongolia's Pivot and the Third Neighbor Policy

Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Mongolia, which had been a Soviet satellite state for nearly 70 years, experienced a massive economic downturn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. This forced the country to build new international ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

Washington became a key target for diplomatic relations, established in 1987 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. The European Union also became a target, leading to a partnership and cooperation agreement in 1993 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. Other important relationships were established with countries like Japan and South Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

Despite improving ties with Russia and China, fears grew within Mongolia about becoming overly reliant on its two immediate neighbors, particularly China, due to its rapidly expanding global influence and increasing control over critical sectors like mining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. As a result, Mongolia began to strengthen what it calls its [[Mongolias Third Neighbor Policy | Third Neighbor Policy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. This policy involves steadily deepening ties with numerous other countries, including key Western states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. This included wide-ranging cooperation with the United States, culminating in a strategic partnership in 2019, and an expanded relationship with the EU, Japan, India, and Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

## Impact of the Ukraine War on Western Engagement

The [[impact_of_the_ukraine_war_on_mongolias_diplomatic_stance | Ukraine war]], which began in early 2022, prompted significant changes in Mongolia's international engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. While Mongolia initially adopted a cautious, neutral approach due to its reliance on Russian energy and fear of undermining relations with Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>, a subtle shift emerged as the war continued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. This was evidenced by the country's president issuing a call for peace at the UN General Assembly in late 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

The most notable development has been the steady increase in contacts with Western countries since early 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

### Key Western Engagements (2023-2024)

*   **United States**: Ongoing high-level contacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.
*   **France**: In May 2023, Emmanuel Macron made the first-ever visit by a French president to Mongolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. French officials explicitly stated the visit aimed to loosen Russia's control over its neighbors and open strategic alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
*   **Germany**: In February 2024, Germany became the first EU member to sign a strategic partnership with Mongolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.
*   **United Kingdom**: The British Foreign Secretary visited Mongolia in April 2024, laying the groundwork for a future partnership agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

### Reasons for Increased Western Interest

The surge in Western interest is multifaceted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. Beyond weakening one of Moscow's closest historical partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>, Western states are keen to gain greater access to Mongolia's valuable mining sector, a point openly highlighted in their statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

From Mongolia's perspective, while economic factors, such as the disastrous effect of the Ukraine war on its economy, play a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>, there may also be deeper internal and external motivations. Younger Mongolians often express a more international outlook, preferring the West over Russia and China, and show support for Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. Furthermore, there is growing nervousness about the increasingly close ties between Beijing and Moscow since the Ukraine war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. Being squeezed between two powerful, aligning neighbors makes maintaining balanced [[Mongolias foreign policy and international relations | foreign policy]] a priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

## Conclusion

Mongolia is not abandoning its close [[Mongolias historical ties with Russia and China | historical ties to Russia and China]] and is not decisively shifting towards the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. Its geography makes such a move impractical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. Instead, Mongolia's [[Mongolias foreign policy and international relations | foreign policy]] aims to protect its economic, political, diplomatic, and strategic autonomy while maintaining its close ties with Moscow and Beijing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. As its two powerful neighbors grow closer, Mongolia is increasingly pivoting towards its "third neighbor" – the rest of the world, including the West – to avoid being squeezed between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

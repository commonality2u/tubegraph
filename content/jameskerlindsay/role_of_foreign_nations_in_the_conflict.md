The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, particularly the 2020 war between Armenia and Azerbaijan, involved significant [[international_relations_and_war | international relations]] and the [[role_of_international_actors_and_geopolitical_implications | geopolitical implications]] of external actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. While the conflict is primarily between Armenia and Azerbaijan, the roles of various foreign nations were perceived as crucial, influencing the outcome and the subsequent views of the affected populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

## Perceived External Support for Azerbaijan

From the Armenian perspective, Azerbaijan's victory in the 2020 conflict was attributed to outside help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

### Turkey's Role
There is considerable anger in Armenia regarding Turkey's support for Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. This support included not only equipment but also military leadership and guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Many Armenians believe that Turkey "directed the war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. The prevailing view is that Azerbaijan did not engage in a fair fight, and the outcome would have been different without Turkish technical support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

### Israel's Technical Support
To a degree, Israeli technical support for Azerbaijan was also noted as a factor in the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## Disillusionment with Western Powers

Armenians express a clear sense of disillusionment with the lack of action from the European Union and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

### Perceived Inaction and Geopolitical Concerns
Beyond the moral argument that these powers should have intervened to stop the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>, there is a [[role_of_international_actors_and_geopolitical_implications | geopolitical]] aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Many references were made to Armenia's role as the country preventing the creation of a "Turkic arc" stretching from Europe to Central Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Armenians believe their country's vital position should be understood and fully supported by [[role_of_western_countries_in_rule_erosion | Western countries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## Complex Relationship with Russia

The most complex perceptions regarding the role of outside actors emerge concerning Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

### Russia as an Ally and Broker
Armenia has historically had a close relationship with Moscow, and many Armenians still consider Russia a key ally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Russia's influence remains strong in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. Russia brokered the ceasefire agreement on November 10, 2020, which stationed Russian peacekeepers in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. This intervention at the last moment prevented a complete victory for Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

### Anger and Suspicion
Despite being an ally, there is a real sense of anger and suspicion in Armenia about Russia's role in the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. This stems from Russia stepping in only when most Armenian-held territory had already been lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. The trust in Russia often appears to stem from a sense of having no other real choice for reliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>, though true faith in that trust is questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

## Overall Perception of Outside Actors

The conflict highlights that states utilize all available help in warfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. From Yerevan, there is a widespread disillusionment concerning the [[role_of_international_actors_in_myanmars_conflict | role of international actors]] and a strong belief that Azerbaijan only won with outside assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. The ongoing situation implies that a long-term settlement or [[international_relations_and_conflict_resolution | reconciliation]] between Armenia and Azerbaijan is far from certain, given the complexities introduced by foreign involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

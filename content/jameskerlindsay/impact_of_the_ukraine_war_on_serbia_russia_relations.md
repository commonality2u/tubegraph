Since the start of the [[russia_ukraine_conflict | Ukraine war]] in February 2022, there has been growing concern about Belgrade's close relationship with Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Unlike most of Europe, [[serbias_relationship_with_russia | Serbia]] has rejected imposing sanctions on Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. [[serbias_relationship_with_russia | Serbia]] has long been considered Russia's closest ally in Europe, a view reinforced by the [[russia_ukraine_conflict | war in Ukraine]] and Serbia's lack of sanctions against Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

However, behind the scenes, a more complex picture is emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Despite public appearances, reports suggest that [[serbias_relationship_with_russia | Serbia]] has been supplying arms to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The perception that [[serbias_relationship_with_russia | Serbia]] and its people are strongly pro-Russian is not as straightforward as it might seem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Historical Context of [[serbias_relationship_with_russia | Serbia]]-Russia Relations

While [[serbias_relationship_with_russia | Serbia]] and Russia have had periods of close ties, they have also experienced significant differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **19th Century:** Imperial Russia became involved in [[serbias_relationship_with_russia | Serbia]] from 1804, seeing itself as the protector of Slavic Christian peoples in Southeast Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This led to [[serbias_relationship_with_russia | Serbia]] gaining autonomy in 1829 and complete independence in 1878 following Russo-Turkish wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Early 20th Century & WWI:** By the early 20th century, [[serbias_relationship_with_russia | Serbia]] and Russia were close allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Russia's support for [[serbias_relationship_with_russia | Serbia]] after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914 was a key factor in sparking the First World War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Interwar and Cold War Periods:** After WWI, relations between Serb-dominated Yugoslavia and the Russian-dominated Soviet Union were limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. The Yugoslav monarchy kept its distance from Moscow due to fears of communism, not establishing diplomatic relations until 1940 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Although communist forces (Partisans) allied with the Soviet Union seized power in Yugoslavia in 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, Yugoslavia broke away from the Soviet Bloc in 1948 due to disagreements between Tito and Stalin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Yugoslavia remained outside Soviet control for the rest of the Cold War, steering a course between the USSR and the West as a founder of the Non-Aligned Movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
*   **Post-Cold War and Kosovo:** In the 1990s, as Yugoslavia disintegrated, the Serbian leader Slobodan Milošević sought support from Russia, but Moscow's post-Cold War weakness limited its ability to help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. In 1999, during the [[kosovo_issue_and_its_impact_on_serbias_foreign_policy | Kosovo conflict]], Russia strongly opposed NATO's bombing campaign against [[serbias_relationship_with_russia | Serbia]] but could do little to stop it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
    *   The [[kosovo_issue_and_its_impact_on_serbias_foreign_policy | Kosovo issue]] significantly shaped contemporary [[serbias_relationship_with_russia | Serbian-Russian relations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. With a more assertive Russia under Vladimir Putin, Moscow backed [[serbias_relationship_with_russia | Serbia]]'s call for autonomy for [[kosovo_issue_and_its_impact_on_serbias_foreign_policy | Kosovo]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. After [[kosovo_issue_and_its_impact_on_serbias_foreign_policy | Kosovo]] declared independence in 2008, [[serbias_relationship_with_russia | Serbia]] relied on Moscow to block [[kosovo_issue_and_its_impact_on_serbias_foreign_policy | Kosovo]]'s membership in the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
    *   This period saw an apparent flourishing of [[serbias_relationship_with_russia | Serbian-Russian relations]], with Russia gaining significant political, economic, and social leverage, including control of [[serbias_relationship_with_russia | Serbia]]'s state energy provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. However, Serbian officials privately complained about negative Russian economic influence, contrasting it with the jobs and growth from European investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
    *   Despite some Russian-Serbian security cooperation, including a humanitarian relief center, this was overshadowed by growing engagement between [[serbias_relationship_with_russia | Serbia]] and NATO, including joint military exercises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. [[serbias_relationship_with_russia | Serbia]] generally pursued an "equidistant foreign policy," valuing ties with Russia, the West, China, and the global South <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
    *   Public opinion in [[serbias_relationship_with_russia | Serbia]] was also less pro-Russian than often perceived; polling showed most Serbs preferred EU membership over closer ties with Moscow, and few spoke Russian, preferring English or German <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

## [[impact_of_the_ukraine_war_on_serbia_russia_relations | Impact of the Ukraine War]]

Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 placed [[serbias_relationship_with_russia | Serbia]] in a challenging position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. [[serbias_relationship_with_russia | Serbia]] attempted to balance its stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>:
*   **Refusal to Sanction Russia:** [[serbias_relationship_with_russia | Serbia]] refused to impose sanctions on Russia, unlike most other European states, seemingly fearing to antagonize Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. It continued high-level contacts with the Russian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
*   **Condemnation and Aid to Ukraine:** Despite not imposing sanctions, [[serbias_relationship_with_russia | Serbia]]'s position was less pro-Russian than it appeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. It openly condemned the Russian invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>, took in Ukrainian refugees, provided humanitarian aid, and pledged support for Ukraine's postwar recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
*   **Arms Supply to Ukraine:** A significant revelation was a report in the Financial Times suggesting that [[serbias_relationship_with_russia | Serbia]], a major arms producer, had supplied Ukraine with over $800 million worth of ammunition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
*   **Continued Public Ties with Russia:** Despite reports of arms supply to Ukraine, the Serbian government continued to insist on the strength of its relationship with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić praised ties to Russia, and the new Serbian government included figures with close links to Russia, such as Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandar Vulin, who has been sanctioned for his ties to Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

## Analysis of Current Relations

The relationship between [[serbias_relationship_with_russia | Serbia]] and Russia is complex and not easily categorized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>:
*   **Challenging Traditional Views:** The idea that [[serbias_relationship_with_russia | Serbia]] is simply reverting to traditional pro-Russian sympathies is flawed, given the historical periods of profound differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. Suggestions of Slavic or Orthodox unity are also too simplistic, as many Slavic and Orthodox countries now have strained relations with Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.
*   **Beyond the Kosovo Issue:** The argument that [[serbias_relationship_with_russia | Serbia]]'s relationship with Moscow is solely driven by [[kosovo_issue_and_its_impact_on_serbias_foreign_policy | Kosovo]] is also insufficient, as Russia is unlikely to reverse its position on [[kosovo_issue_and_its_impact_on_serbias_foreign_policy | Kosovo]] even if [[serbias_relationship_with_russia | Serbia]] turned against Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.
*   **Shifting Public Opinion:** The real issue appears to be changing public opinion, particularly a reaction against the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. The West's support for Ukraine's territorial integrity, after bombing [[serbias_relationship_with_russia | Serbia]] for similar reasons, has fueled anger and accusations of double standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. Many in [[serbias_relationship_with_russia | Serbia]] seem to be taking Russia's side not as an endorsement of Moscow, but as a protest against the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

The [[russia_ukraine_conflict | Ukraine war]] is contributing to growing political and social polarization within [[serbias_relationship_with_russia | Serbia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. While the Serbian leadership may remain broadly pro-European (despite authoritarian concerns), public opinion appears to be shifting in the opposite direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. This has potentially serious long-term implications for [[serbias_relationship_with_russia | Serbia]], the Balkans, and Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.

The arrival of European colonialism in the 19th century profoundly shaped the [[historical_background_of_the_somali_region | Somali region]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10]</a>. This period saw the areas inhabited by the Somali people, who share a single ethnic group, language, religion (almost wholly Sunni Muslim), and culture, divided among three imperial powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16]</a>.

## Division of Somali Territories
The colonial powers partitioned the Somali lands as follows:
*   **France** took control of the area that is now Djibouti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22]</a>.
*   **Britain** ruled Somaliland and Kenya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26]</a>.
*   **Italy** gained control over much of what is modern-day Somalia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29]</a>.

This colonial presence lasted until the start of decolonization after the Second World War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33]</a>.

## Post-Colonial Unification and Its Challenges
The process of decolonization led to the independence of the former British and Italian territories, which then merged to form the Somali Republic:
*   The British Somaliland Protectorate became independent on June 26, 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38]</a>.
*   The Italian-administered trust territory of Somaliland gained independence just days later, on July 1, 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43]</a>.
*   These two parts then merged to form the Somali Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52]</a>.

While this joint state was initially welcomed as a step towards the unification of the Somali people, problems quickly emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57]</a>. Somaliland, which had seen itself as an equal partner in the Republic, was downgraded in 1961, leading to significant Isaaq discontent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05]</a>. This early tension highlights the challenges posed by the arbitrary [[impact_of_colonial_boundaries_on_modern_borders | colonial legacy]] on the newly formed state and contributed to the later [[historical_context_of_somaliland_independence | independence of Somaliland]] in 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40]</a>.

In November 2023, Armenia's prime minister notably skipped the latest summit meeting of the Russian-led Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This decision was widely interpreted as a direct snub to Russian President Vladimir Putin, signaling growing tensions between Yerevan and Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The move has fueled speculation about a potential final break in relations, particularly as Armenia has also been strengthening ties with the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Historical Context and Post-Soviet Ties

Armenia, a landlocked country in the South Caucasus, has a long and complex history, strategically located at the crossroads of Europe and Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. Having been the first nation to adopt Christianity in 301 AD, it later came under various imperial rules, including Persian and Ottoman Empires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. By the 19th century, Russia emerged as a new imperial power, seizing control of Eastern Armenia from Persia in 1828 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. After a brief period of independence following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, Armenia was invaded by communist Russian forces in September 1920, leading to the formation of the Soviet Republic of Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.

Upon the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Armenia became an independent sovereign state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>. Despite its newfound independence, Armenia retained close links to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. It joined the Commonwealth of Independent States and continued to host a Russian military base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>. A key factor shaping this relationship was the [[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict | conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan]] over Nagorno-Karabakh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>. Although Russia officially remained neutral in its [[role_of_russia_in_the_nagornokarabakh_peace_process | role in the Nagorno-Karabakh peace process]], it was often seen as favoring Armenia, partly by supplying it with arms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>. Armenia's control of Azerbaijani territory also led to tensions with NATO-member Turkey, which imposed an embargo on Armenia due to its close ties with Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>. This geopolitical squeeze underscored Armenia's need to maintain close ties with Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>. In 2002, Armenia became part of the CSTO, a military alliance of six former Soviet states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>.

## Shifting Alliances and Growing Tensions

In the early 2000s, as [[armenias_historical_ties_with_russia_and_the_west | Russia's ties to the West]] deteriorated, events like the pro-Russian leadership being toppled in neighboring Georgia in 2003 prompted fears that other states, including Armenia, might seek NATO membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>. While Armenia did signal a desire for closer ties with the European Union, joining the EU's Eastern Partnership in May 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>, this abruptly ended in 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>. Despite nearing completion of a free trade agreement with the EU, Armenia unexpectedly announced its decision to join the new Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>. By 2017, even with a new Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement signed with the EU, Armenia seemed firmly committed to its relationship with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>.

## The Pashinyan Era and Deterioration of Relations

The situation began to change in 2018 when widespread protests led to the ousting of Armenia's long-standing government and brought Nikol Pashinyan to power as prime minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>. Although Pashinyan initially stated his intention to maintain close ties with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>, suspicions grew on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>. Moscow mistrusted the new democratic government, while Armenia became increasingly concerned about thawing relations between Russia and Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>.

This culminated in 2020, when Azerbaijan launched a military campaign to retake Nagorno-Karabakh after nearly a quarter-century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>. Azerbaijani forces quickly regained occupied areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>. Russia stepped in at the last moment to broker a ceasefire, overseen by a Russian peacekeeping force, just as Azerbaijan prepared for a final assault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>. Azerbaijan's victory was a significant blow to Armenia, leading to widespread resentment against Russia for failing to prevent or stop the war earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59:00">[08:59:00]</a>.

Following the 2020 [[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict | Nagorno-Karabakh conflict]], relations between Yerevan and Moscow steadily deteriorated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a>. Russia openly criticized Prime Minister Pashinyan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>. Concurrently, as Moscow built closer ties with Azerbaijan, Armenia began engaging more openly with U.S. and European leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>. Armenia also started providing humanitarian aid to Ukraine, much to Moscow's displeasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:00">[09:46:00]</a>.

The depth of the strained relations was clearly highlighted in September 2023 when Azerbaijan launched a fresh attack against Nagorno-Karabakh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>. This time, Russia made no effort to intervene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>. Azerbaijani forces gained complete control of the region, leading to the exodus of its remaining 100,000 or so inhabitants to Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:12:00]</a>.

Since then, relations have seemingly collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:00]</a>. Armenia ratified its participation in the International Criminal Court, a move condemned by Moscow due to ongoing investigations into alleged Russian war crimes in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>. It was against this backdrop that Pashinyan boycotted the CSTO summit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:00">[10:34:00]</a>, a decision Moscow viewed as an anti-Russian move orchestrated by the West, especially as it followed a high-profile trip by Pashinyan to France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>.

## [[future_of_armenia_and_nagornokarabakh | Future of Armenia]] and Geopolitical Challenges

Despite the apparent shift, a complete break with Russia and alignment with the West is not straightforward for Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>.

### NATO Membership
Switching allegiance to NATO would be extremely difficult, if not impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:00">[11:06:00]</a>. While many NATO countries would welcome Armenia, deep-rooted tensions with Turkey mean that Ankara—and possibly Hungary—would almost certainly block any application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>. Even if membership were considered, Turkey might demand unacceptable conditions, such as Armenia dropping genocide accusations related to the 1915 events, or granting Azerbaijan a land corridor to Nakhichevan, which would create an unbroken transport link between Turkey and Central Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:00">[11:29:00]</a>.

### EU Membership
EU membership appears to be a more logical and feasible option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54:00]</a>. The recommendation for neighboring Georgia's candidacy indicates the EU's openness to Caucasus expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:00">[12:03:00]</a>. However, EU membership does not seem to be a priority for Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>. Many Armenians believe the EU would not want Armenia, despite a solid pro-Armenian lobby in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>. There are also concerns about the societal implications, as Armenia remains a largely conservative country, and joining the EU would require liberalization, such as greater LGBT rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a>. These attitudes are seemingly encouraged by Russian disinformation campaigns through its broadcasts into Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:03:00">[13:03:00]</a>. Public opinion polls reflect this reticence, with only about half the population favoring EU membership, significantly lower than in most other potential member states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15:00">[13:15:00]</a>.

### Security Concerns
A crucial factor for Armenians is the belief that the West cannot provide the security they need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:00">[13:32:00]</a>. The real threat is perceived to be Turkey and Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:41:00">[13:41:00]</a>. Despite the loss of Nagorno-Karabakh, fears persist that Azerbaijan might try to seize southern Armenia to create a land bridge to Nakhichevan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:45:00">[13:45:00]</a>. Armenians feel that the West would be unable or unwilling to prevent such an attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56:00">[13:56:00]</a>. Notwithstanding Moscow's recent failures, many Armenians still believe Russia is the only actor that could prevent such a division of Armenia, especially as it would sever a vital link to neighboring [[iran_azerbaijan_relations_and_tensions | Iran]], a key Russian ally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05:00">[14:05:00]</a>.

Ultimately, most Armenians, perhaps reflecting their long history of being caught between rival powers, believe they must accept the current situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:27:00">[14:27:00]</a>. While they no longer trust Russia, they feel that completely abandoning it for closer Western ties is not an option, at least for now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:39:00">[14:39:00]</a>.

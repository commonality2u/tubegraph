Ireland has historically maintained a firm principle of [[irelands_historical_and_current_stance_on_neutrality | neutrality]] and remained outside NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. However, signs indicate this stance is changing, particularly following Russia's invasion of Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This shift is driven by a growing realization that Ireland's wider political, security, and strategic environment is evolving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The [[impact_of_the_ukraine_war_on_irelands_foreign_policy | war in Ukraine]] has prompted a broader debate across Europe regarding [[irelands_historical_and_current_stance_on_neutrality | neutrality]] and NATO membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Historical Basis of Irish Neutrality

For most of its existence, Ireland has upheld an official policy of military neutrality, which many consider an integral part of its national identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

*   **Early Distancing from Britain**
    *   The Irish Free State, established after World War I, sought to distance itself from Britain and limit its involvement in foreign conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Its constitution required parliamentary approval for war involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
    *   Upon becoming a republic in 1937, Ireland's new constitution emphasized cooperation between states and the peaceful settlement of disputes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   **Formal Proclamation During WWII**
    *   The formal principle of [[irelands_historical_and_current_stance_on_neutrality | neutrality]] was proclaimed at the start of the Second World War when Ireland refused to join the Allies against Nazi Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
    *   Despite this, Ireland was inclined towards the Allies, sharing intelligence and suppressing anti-British activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Approximately 50,000 Irish citizens joined the British armed forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   **Refusal to Join NATO (1949)**
    *   Following WWII and the start of the Cold War, the United States invited Ireland to join NATO in 1949 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
    *   Ireland refused, viewing a formal military alliance with the United Kingdom, which still occupied a part of its constitutionally claimed territory, as unacceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
    *   Therefore, Ireland's neutrality was primarily based on political realities rather than ideological conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Notably, [[irelands_historical_and_current_stance_on_neutrality | neutrality]] has never been formally written into the Irish Constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

## Evolution of Neutrality and International Engagement

Despite its neutrality, Ireland has built a strong reputation on the international stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

*   **UN Peacekeeping**
    *   Ireland is a significant contributor to UN peacekeeping missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Over 60 years, it has deployed troops to various international hotspots like the Congo, Cyprus, and Lebanon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. This aligns with [[irelands_participation_in_international_security_and_peacekeeping | Ireland's participation in international security and peacekeeping]].
*   **Improved UK Relations and EU Membership**
    *   By the 1990s, relations with the UK had significantly improved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Ireland joined the European Communities (now the EU) alongside Britain in 1973 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
    *   The 1998 Good Friday Agreement transformed Anglo-Irish relations and opened the way for eventual Irish unification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   **Post-Cold War Adjustments**
    *   The end of the Cold War saw Ireland join NATO's Partnership for Peace program in 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.
    *   Despite this, [[irelands_historical_and_current_stance_on_neutrality | neutrality]] remained deeply ingrained in Irish thinking, as demonstrated by Ireland's insistence on a protocol in the 2009 Lisbon Treaty reaffirming its traditional military neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

## Arguments for Reassessing Neutrality and Potential NATO Membership

The [[impact_of_the_ukraine_war_on_irelands_foreign_policy | war in Ukraine]] has significantly challenged Ireland's long-held neutral stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

*   **Strong Support for Ukraine**
    *   Ireland has openly and unequivocally supported Ukraine, emphasizing that military neutrality does not equate to political neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
    *   Dublin has condemned Russia's invasion, supported EU sanctions, expelled Russia from the Council of Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>, and provided â‚¬55 million in non-lethal military aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Ireland has also agreed to train Ukrainian forces in another EU member state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
*   **Changing Strategic Environment**
    *   Increased Russian naval activity around Irish waters highlights Ireland's growing strategic significance, particularly due to vital undersea communications cables running to North America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.
    *   Concerns about potential Russian attacks on these cables have led the Irish government to consider joining a NATO project to protect this critical infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Government's Openness to Change**
    *   The government is reportedly keeping its options open, rejecting proposals to codify [[irelands_historical_and_current_stance_on_neutrality | neutrality]] into the Constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
    *   Ireland's EU affairs minister openly stated that the Russian invasion was forcing a reconsideration of neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
    *   A public consultation on the country's defense orientation is underway, signaling a serious consideration of a fundamental change to Ireland's strategic position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
*   **Challenging Historical Justifications**
    *   The argument against allying with the UK due to Northern Ireland has been challenged by a revelation of a secret 1950s agreement where Britain provided air security to Ireland for 70 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. The Irish government has refused to confirm or deny this report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.
    *   Proponents argue that with guaranteed defense from Britain, the EU, and the United States, Ireland should accept reality and join NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

## Arguments for Maintaining Neutrality

Despite the evolving debate, many advocate for Ireland to retain its neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

*   **Existential/Identity Argument**
    *   Neutrality is seen as a fundamental, almost sacred, part of the Irish identity, defining its role on the world stage, especially as a UN peacekeeper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
    *   Opponents of change argue that abandoning neutrality would diminish Ireland's international standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
    *   However, critics point to Norway, a NATO member, as a successful mediator in world politics, suggesting neutrality is not a prerequisite for such a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
*   **Pragmatic Arguments**
    *   There is no immediate need to abandon [[irelands_historical_and_current_stance_on_neutrality | neutrality]], as no one is pressuring Ireland to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
    *   Ireland is effectively protected by NATO anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>, and other EU members like Austria show no signs of changing their neutral stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
*   **Cost Question**
    *   Ireland's defense expenditure is among the lowest in the EU, at just 0.3% of GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
    *   Joining NATO would require a significant increase to the expected 2% of GDP on defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>, which many view as an unacceptable diversion of funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.
    *   Critics of this view argue that Ireland's current position is akin to "freeloading," benefiting from a broader European defense umbrella without contributing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. They also suggest that increased defense spending is inevitable regardless of neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>, and the government has already announced the largest defense spending increase in its history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.
*   **Historical Grievances (Northern Ireland)**
    *   Despite progress on [[challenges_and_considerations_for_a_potential_united_ireland | Northern Ireland]], many still find it inconceivable for Ireland to formally ally with a country perceived as occupying Irish territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. This relates to the [[history_of_irelands_partition_and_conflict | history of Ireland's partition and conflict]].

## Public Opinion and Future Outlook

The [[debate_on_ireland_joining_nato_amidst_geopolitical_changes | debate on Ireland joining NATO]] is ongoing, with mixed public opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.

*   **Mixed Polling Data**
    *   An April 2022 poll showed 70% support for sanctions against Russia but two-thirds still wanted to maintain neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.
    *   Another poll indicated a more even split, with 52% favoring NATO membership versus 48% against <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
    *   A referendum on the issue, which would almost certainly be required, could go either way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
*   **Alternative Options**
    *   Even if full NATO membership is deemed too significant a step, other options exist, such as closer cooperation with the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.
    *   Another possibility is abandoning formal neutrality to become more integrated into European Union defense structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.
*   **Broader Implications**
    *   The discussions in Ireland reflect how the [[international_relations_and_war | Ukraine war]] has profoundly affected European and [[international_relations_and_war | international security]] debates, forcing many countries to rethink long-held views on their place in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

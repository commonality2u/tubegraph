In May 2024, a diplomatic dispute emerged when North Macedonia's new president insisted on using the country's old name during her inauguration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This act led to the Greek ambassador walking out of the ceremony in protest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Greek and European officials emphasized that adherence to the [[north_macedonia_and_greece_peace_agreement | agreement with Athens]] is crucial for North Macedonia's future [[impact_of_north_macedonias_political_changes_on_eu_integration | EU integration process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## The Prespa Agreement

Peace agreements are fundamental to international relations, often resulting from complex negotiations facilitated by third parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. They are vital for ending conflicts and preventing escalation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. There is an expectation that once an agreement is reached, the parties will adhere to it, with its fundamental terms remaining unchallenged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The faithful execution of these agreements is a cornerstone of modern diplomacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

North Macedonia reached a landmark [[north_macedonia_and_greece_peace_agreement | agreement with Greece]] in 2018, concluding a 30-year dispute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. There are concerns that North Macedonia's new government might withdraw from this arrangement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### Historical Context of the Name Dispute

North Macedonia is a landlocked country in Southeast Europe, approximately 26,000 square kilometres (10,000 square miles) in area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. It borders Albania, Kosovo, Serbia, Bulgaria, and Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Its population is about 2.1 million, with a majority of ethnic Macedonians speaking a South Slavic language, and a significant Albanian community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

The region of Macedonia has a long and rich history, emerging as a kingdom on the periphery of ancient Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Under Alexander the Great, its imperial control extended to India and Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. It later fell under Roman, Bulgarian, and Serb rule before being conquered by the Ottoman Empire in the 14th century, which lasted until the 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. In 1912, Greece, Serbia, and Bulgaria joined forces to seize Macedonia from Ottoman rule in the First Balkan War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. After a brief alliance, a Second Balkan War broke out in 1913 due to disagreements over territorial division, leading to Macedonia's formal partition among Serbia, Bulgaria, and Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

After World War I, Serbian-held Macedonia became part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Following World War II, as Yugoslavia was reconstituted as a socialist federation, Macedonia became one of its six constituent republics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Over subsequent decades, Yugoslav authorities actively fostered a distinct Macedonian identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

With the collapse of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, Macedonia declared independence on December 8, 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. From the outset, Greece objected to the country's name, the Republic of Macedonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Greece argued that the new state was laying claim to its own region of Macedonia and usurping the region's historical Greek identity by adopting symbols linked to ancient Hellenistic Macedonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

Supported by its European Union partners, Greece ensured that when the new country joined the UN in April 1993, it did so under the provisional name "the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM)" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. The UN then initiated a process to resolve the name issue, leading to an interim agreement in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. In this agreement, the Macedonian government agreed to change contentious state symbols, and the Greek government promised not to obstruct its efforts to join international organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

Despite hopes for a final agreement, efforts to resolve the name issue continued unsuccessfully for two decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. Beyond the country's title, talks were complicated by disagreements over the description of the country's language and inhabitants, with Greece objecting to the term "Macedonian" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. The question of whether the state could use one name internally and another internationally also arose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

Relations deteriorated as Athens blocked North Macedonia's efforts to join NATO and the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. In response, the Macedonian government asserted even more claims to the country's ancient Greek heritage, such as naming the main national airport and highway after Alexander the Great <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

### Terms of the Prespa Agreement

A breakthrough occurred in 2017 with the election of a new government in Skopje committed to NATO and EU membership, coinciding with a Greek administration also seeking a resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. After intensive discussions, an agreement was reached in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

The agreement stipulated that the country would be renamed the Republic of North Macedonia, to be used universally, both domestically and internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. The country's language would remain Macedonian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. While inhabitants would officially be called citizens of the Republic of North Macedonia, they could continue to call themselves Macedonians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. The deal also explicitly recognized the country's distinct Greek and Slavic heritage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

The two countries signed the [[north_macedonia_and_greece_peace_agreement | agreement]] at an international ceremony on the shores of Lake Prespa on June 19, 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. The international community hailed the Prespa Agreement as a significant step forward for both countries and a positive development for the wider Balkan region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

### Ratification and Initial Impact

Despite international praise, the [[north_macedonia_and_greece_peace_agreement | Prespa Agreement]] faced considerable opposition in both countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. In North Macedonia, it provoked widespread anger and a highly controversial ratification process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. While Albanian political parties accepted the deal, the right-wing opposition VMRO-DPMNE party rejected it as a betrayal of national identity driven by external pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. A referendum in September 2018, though winning a majority, failed to meet the required turnout threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. Nevertheless, it was put to Parliament on January 11, 2019, securing 81 votes in the 120-member assembly amidst accusations of bribery, blackmail, and external pressure, thereby achieving the two-thirds support needed for constitutional changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

In Greece, many rejected the deal as an unacceptable compromise on Greek heritage and identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. However, the agreement passed in the Greek Parliament with 153 votes in the 300-member assembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. On February 14, 2019, the United Nations officially acknowledged the name change, formalizing "the Republic of North Macedonia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

Although widely hailed as a significant step forward, the [[north_macedonia_and_greece_peace_agreement | Prespa Agreement]] yielded mixed results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. It facilitated North Macedonia's accession to NATO, becoming its 30th member on March 27, 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. However, hopes that it would unlock the country's [[impact_of_north_macedonias_political_changes_on_eu_integration | EU accession]] prospects proved premature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. While Greece lifted its veto, [[bulgaria_and_north_macedonia_eu_accession_dispute | Bulgaria subsequently imposed its own demands]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

The agreement remained controversial in both countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. The main Greek opposition party, New Democracy, opposed the arrangement but adopted a pragmatic stance upon returning to power, stating it would not challenge the deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the main opposition in North Macedonia, which continued to vehemently oppose the [[north_macedonia_and_greece_peace_agreement | agreement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

## The Latest Crisis (May 2024)

This opposition culminated in the latest crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. On May 8, 2024, North Macedonia held parliamentary and presidential elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. The VMRO-DPMNE achieved a significant victory in both contests, securing 58 seats in the assembly, just three short of an outright majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. In the largely ceremonial presidential race, the party's candidate, Gordana Siljanovska-Davkova, a constitutional law professor, won convincingly with two-thirds of the vote in the second round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

Days later, on May 12, she was sworn into office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. Having argued during her campaign that the [[north_macedonia_and_greece_peace_agreement | Prespa Agreement]] violated national law and citizens' rights, she used the occasion to make her point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. She refused to use "Republic of North Macedonia" in the official oath of office, opting instead for "Republic of Macedonia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

This decision sparked an immediate response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. The Greek Ambassador left the ceremony in protest, and the Greek foreign ministry condemned the move as a violation of the [[north_macedonia_and_greece_peace_agreement | Prespa Agreement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. Within hours, EU officials stressed that North Macedonia's progress towards [[impact_of_north_macedonias_political_changes_on_eu_integration | full European integration]] depended on adherence to the [[north_macedonia_and_greece_peace_agreement | agreement with Greece]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

## Future Outlook

The key question is whether the president's action was a personal provocation or indicative of the new government formally revoking the [[north_macedonia_and_greece_peace_agreement | agreement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. It seems unlikely that the government will attempt to abandon the [[north_macedonia_and_greece_peace_agreement | Prespa Agreement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. Such a move would immediately halt any further [[impact_of_north_macedonias_political_changes_on_eu_integration | EU accession talks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>, facing renewed Greek opposition and disapproval from many other EU members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. Given that the VMRO-DPMNE, including the new president, insists that [[impact_of_north_macedonias_political_changes_on_eu_integration | EU accession]] remains a core goal, balancing this with abandoning the agreement would be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

Some in North Macedonia might argue that the prospects of [[impact_of_north_macedonias_political_changes_on_eu_integration | EU accession]] are so dim that abandoning the despised agreement wouldn't matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. Ultimately, internal politics may safeguard the deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. Despite its disdain for the [[north_macedonia_and_greece_peace_agreement | Prespa Agreement]], the new government would need support to pass a constitutional change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

While the new government may object to the name and continue to question the [[north_macedonia_and_greece_peace_agreement | Prespa Agreement]], a formal breach seems unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. However, it could undermine the agreement in other ways, such as referring to "the Republic of Macedonia" in official statements and documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. Such actions would inevitably create problems, as Greece and the EU might feel compelled to push back against actions that go against the spirit, if not the letter, of the deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. Thus, despite earlier hopes, the Macedonian name issue appears to be back on the agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.

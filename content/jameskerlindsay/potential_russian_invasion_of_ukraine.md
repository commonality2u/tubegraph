Fears have been growing that Russia is preparing to launch a full-scale [[russias_invasion_of_ukraine | invasion of Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. With over 100,000 troops amassed close to the border and unacceptable de-escalation conditions imposed, there is concern that Moscow could initiate a dangerous new phase in the [[russia_ukraine_conflict | conflict in eastern Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Background to the Conflict

Ukraine is located in Eastern Europe, spanning 600,000 square kilometers (200,000 square miles), making it the 45th largest UN member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Its population is approximately 44 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. According to the 2001 census, 78% of the population were ethnic Ukrainians, followed by Russians comprising about 17% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

To Ukraine's northeast lies Russia, the world's largest country at 17 million square kilometers (6.6 million square miles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Russia's population is around 144 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

The current crisis stems from the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. After independence, Russia and Ukraine faced issues concerning nuclear weapons in Ukraine and the status of the Soviet fleet in the Crimean Peninsula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Crimea, ceded by Russia to Ukraine in the 1950s, remained a point of resentment for many Russians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. These issues were resolved when Ukraine transferred missiles to Russia in exchange for a Russian guarantee of its sovereignty and territorial integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Later, the navy was divided, and Russia secured control over a port in Crimea until 2017, later extended to 2042 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

While Ukraine joined the Russian-led Commonwealth of Independent States, many Ukrainians advocated for closer ties with the West, including [[european_union_and_nato_aspirations_versus_prorussian_sentiment | EU and NATO membership]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This came to a head in November 2013 when Ukraine's pro-Russian president blocked an association agreement with the EU, leading to mass protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. As the president fled to Russia, counter-protests emerged in the Russian-speaking east and south, prompting Russia to invade and annex Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Russia then supported a separatist insurgency in the two Russian-dominated eastern provinces, collectively known as the Donbas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

Fighting continued despite ceasefire agreements that envisioned the departure of Russian forces in exchange for decentralized power in the two regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. By 2020, the conflict in the east had resulted in approximately 14,000 lives lost and 1.5 million people displaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Russia began cementing control over the east by granting Russian citizenship to its inhabitants and increasingly expressed its desire for Ukraine to remain firmly within Russia's sphere of influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

Against the backdrop of a significant troop buildup, Russian President Vladimir Putin published an essay stating that Russians and Ukrainians are "one people" and that "the true sovereignty of Ukraine is possible only in partnership with Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. In December 2021, Moscow presented the United States and NATO with two draft treaties, outlining terms for a new security relationship and demanding that NATO halt further expansion, particularly into Ukraine or any former part of the USSR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. NATO immediately rejected these demands, asserting that membership is a decision for the organization and applicant countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## Current Situation and Potential Invasion

The Russian military buildup has continued, with recent estimates suggesting around 120,000 troops within 200 kilometers (120 miles) of the border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. This has fueled widespread fears of an imminent [[russias_invasion_of_ukraine | invasion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. While some observers have dismissed this as posturing, the context has changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Explicit statements about Ukraine's future being tied to Russia and direct calls for NATO to avoid expansion into the former Soviet Union signal a strong Russian resolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Given NATO's rejection of these calls, it may be difficult for Russia to back down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

## Potential Objectives of an Invasion

The rationale for an invasion is complex and has evolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>:

*   **Beyond protecting ethnic Russians**: While this may have been an objective in 2013, Moscow now controls key ethnic Russian districts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Any further expansion would extend into areas predominantly inhabited by ethnic Ukrainians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. A full occupation of Ukraine appears to be out of the question due to enormous military, economic, political, and diplomatic costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. A partial invasion would likely make the rest of the country more anti-Russian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.
*   **Controlling NATO's expansion**: While Russia views NATO as a threat and argues against its expansion into the former Soviet Union, an invasion might not necessarily change the current situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. NATO has been hesitant to admit Ukraine, and the prospect of Ukrainian membership has long ceased to be realistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. However, an [[russias_invasion_of_ukraine | invasion]] might encourage other neutral countries, such as Finland (which shares a 1300 km border with Russia), to consider NATO membership, potentially leading to more NATO presence on Russia's borders, not less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
*   **Securing existing territorial gains**: The most plausible objective for an invasion would be to leverage military action to formally secure Ukraine's acceptance of Russia's annexation of Crimea and potentially the formal transfer of the Donbas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. This would also send a powerful message about Russia's global standing and its willingness to act in its own interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

## Factors and Risks

### Military Risk
On the surface, Russia holds a commanding position due to its vastly superior forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. However, Kyiv has significantly improved its military capabilities since 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Observers suggest that a successful [[russias_invasion_of_ukraine | invasion]] would require even greater Russian numbers than currently assembled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. Direct outside military support for Ukraine would be limited, as NATO countries are unlikely to go to war with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

### Political Consequences
NATO has warned that further aggression against Ukraine would have "massive consequences and would carry a high price," a sentiment echoed by the European Union and US President Biden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. Politically, the effects of an [[russias_invasion_of_ukraine | invasion]] would be mixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. As a veto-wielding permanent member of the UN Security Council, Russia would not face a formal UN Security Council resolution against its actions, though there might be one from the General Assembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. While it would lead to further estrangement from the West, Russia has already drifted away from Europe and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. Many other countries would be ambivalent, as Russia maintains significant influence and adeptly leverages its capabilities for geopolitical advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. President Putin might believe he can bear any new political costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

### Economic Consequences
The most effective EU and NATO actions would likely be in the economic sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. While many sanctions have been imposed since 2013, additional areas could be targeted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Energy, with Europe being a key market for Russian natural gas, is one area where decisive action could be taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. However, Russia's record gold and foreign exchange reserves provide a large "war chest" to weather the immediate impact of further sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Putin also knows that disrupting energy supplies would significantly impact already high energy prices in Europe, incurring a major domestic political cost for Western countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

A long-term option is a decisive shift away from Russian energy sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken suggested Germany cancel Nord Stream 2, a gas pipeline bypassing Ukraine to link Russia and Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. While this would hit Russia hard, especially as Germany is its largest market, it wouldn't have an immediate impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. Cancellation would also raise concerns about Europe's long-term energy strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. While the U.S. sees Nord Stream 2 as leverage over Russia, Moscow and many in the EU view it as Russian leverage over Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

## Conclusion

The question of whether Russia will invade remains uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. An [[russias_invasion_of_ukraine | invasion]] could achieve Russia's goals of deterring NATO enlargement into Ukraine, securing its gains in the east, and sending a message of resolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. Despite potential high military costs, Russia is aware that external intervention is highly unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. The decision hinges on what Russia aims to achieve and its ability to withstand the longer-term political and economic effects of an [[russias_invasion_of_ukraine | invasion]], which may not be as severe as many anticipate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. In this sense, the threat of an [[russias_invasion_of_ukraine | invasion]] appears very real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. Even if Russia holds off for now and diplomatic efforts succeed in de-escalating the crisis, the possibility of eventual military action is likely to remain a significant prospect for the foreseeable future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

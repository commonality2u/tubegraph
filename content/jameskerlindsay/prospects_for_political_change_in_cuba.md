In March 2024, rare protests erupted in several cities across Cuba due to growing food shortages and energy price increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The Cuban government has since accused the United States of instigating these demonstrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. While Washington vehemently denies these claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, the events have highlighted the ongoing tension between the two nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a> and raised questions about the potential for political change within the Communist regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Current Crisis and Social Unrest

Cuba is experiencing its most severe [[cubas_economic_crisis_and_protests | economic crisis]] since the end of the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>, severely impacted by the pandemic, global inflation, fuel shortages, and the long-standing [[impact_of_the_us_embargo_on_cuba | US embargo]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. Recent measures include a 500% fuel price increase on March 1, 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, compounded by shortages of vital items like baby milk and medicines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a> and widespread power outages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. Havana has made an urgent and unprecedented appeal to the United Nations World Food Program for assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

These hardships have fueled widespread anger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>, culminating in protests in Santiago de Cuba, the country's second-largest city, and other towns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. Cuban officials claim to be addressing the problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

## [[uscuba_relations_and_accusations_of_interference | US-Cuba Relations and Accusations]]

The protests have further heightened tensions between Havana and Washington <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. The Cuban government summoned the most senior US diplomat to accuse the United States of instigating the unrest and interfering in Cuba's internal affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

The US officially denies any involvement, calling the accusations "absurd" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. However, US officials have made it clear that Washington supports the Cuban people's right to democracy and fundamental freedoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

### Historical Context of [[uscuba_relations_and_accusations_of_interference | US-Cuba Tensions]]

The relationship between the US and Cuba has been long, complex, and often embattled for over 60 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The US views Cuba as an autocratic single-party state that denies its citizens fundamental democratic and social freedoms, tramples on human rights, and has undermined US interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

Historically, the US has exerted significant influence over Cuba, establishing a naval base at Guantanamo Bay and retaining the right to intervene in Cuban affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Following the Cuban Revolution in 1959, relations rapidly deteriorated after the new regime nationalized American-owned properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. The US responded with sanctions and a trade embargo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

Subsequent US administrations have varied their approach:
*   **Post-Soviet Collapse:** Washington hardened its stance, passing legislation to isolate Cuba further and impose punitive actions against companies doing business there, aiming to bring down the Castro regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   **Clinton Administration (late 1990s):** Eased travel restrictions and opened pathways for "people-to-people contact" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
*   **Bush Administration (2001):** Reinforced the embargo and reimposed travel restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   **Obama Administration (2009-2017):** Initiated a thaw in relations, focusing on engagement. Embassies reopened, and travel restrictions were eased, though the embargo remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
*   **Trump Administration (2017-2021):** Reversed many Obama-era steps and tightened the embargo, citing human rights violations and Cuba's support for [[venezuelas_political_history | Venezuela]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Biden Administration (2021-present):** Despite expectations of renewed engagement after Raul Castro stepped down in April 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>, there has been no return to the Obama-era d√©tente. The core embargo remains intact due to continued US concerns over human rights abuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

### [[cubas_historical_context_and_relations_with_russia | Cuba's Relations with Russia]]

Despite the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cuba has maintained good terms with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. Following the start of the war in Ukraine in early 2022, Moscow and Havana increased their economic, political, and military cooperation in response to Western sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. Reports of Cubans signing up for the Russian army have further stoked tensions, although Havana denies recruitment efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

## Prospects for Change

The current situation combines multiple factors, including a severe economic crisis and mounting public anger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. While Cuba has a history of suppressing dissent, the rapid escalation of such situations elsewhere suggests that significant political change could occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

Both Havana and Washington frame the protests within a broader struggle for Cuba's self-determination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>:
*   **Havana's View:** Portrays the situation as a powerful neighbor's interference and a cruel embargo imposed for daring to oppose its control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.
*   **Washington's View:** Sees the confrontation as an effort to end a crumbling one-party Communist regime that has deprived the Cuban people of their democratic and human rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

The future remains uncertain: whether the unrest will be contained or lead to a more substantial challenge to the ruling Communist Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

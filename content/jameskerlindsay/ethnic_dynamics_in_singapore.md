Singapore, one of the world's smallest yet most successful countries, is home to a diverse mixture of national groups within its 5.45 million population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:25">[01:42:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:17">[01:46:17]</a>. This ethnic diversity has played a significant role in its [[historical_context_of_malaysia_and_singapore_relations | historical context]] and political journey, particularly during its union with and [[singapores_expulsion_from_malaysia | expulsion from Malaysia]].

## Population Composition
The largest community in Singapore is ethnic Chinese, making up approximately three-quarters of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:57">[01:49:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:16">[01:52:16]</a>. Malays constitute about 15 percent, and ethnic Indians represent 7.5 percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:10">[01:55:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:24">[01:58:24]</a>. The remaining 1.5 percent are composed of Europeans, Eurasians, and other communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:18">[02:02:18]</a>.

## Historical Context of Ethnic Makeup
Singapore's population grew rapidly after Sir Stamford Raffles established a British trading post in 1819 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:29">[02:08:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:15">[02:16:15]</a>. From just a couple of hundred people, the island's inhabitants surpassed ten thousand within five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:03">[03:02:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:05">[03:06:05]</a>. By 1901, the population reached 225,000, rising to over half a million by 1931 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:30">[03:10:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:30">[03:13:30]</a>. While this growth was driven by Malay and Indian immigration, ethnic Chinese formed the largest single community almost from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:54">[03:17:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:28">[03:21:28]</a>.

## Ethnic Considerations in the Federation of Malaysia
When the idea of Singapore joining the Federation of Malaya was debated, political leaders in the Federation were cautious about unification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:27">[04:39:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. A key concern was Singapore's larger population, particularly the implications of 3.6 million Chinese potentially outnumbering the 3.4 million Malays in a united country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:33">[04:50:33]</a>. Despite these worries, wider political concerns, including an ongoing communist insurgency, eventually led to the agreement for the creation of Malaysia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:04">[04:57:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:40">[05:05:40]</a>.

## Ethnic Tensions During the Union
From its inception on September 16, 1963, the union of Singapore within the Federation of Malaysia proved difficult, both economically and politically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:26">[06:24:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:10">[06:29:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>. Underlying these difficulties, ethnic tensions between Malays and Chinese began to escalate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:04">[07:32:04]</a>.

### Riots in Singapore
These tensions culminated in significant unrest:
> "This came to a head in July and September 1964, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:22">[07:38:22]</a> when rioting broke out in Singapore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:20">[07:41:20]</a> that left 36 dead and over 550 injured." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:31">[07:44:31]</a>

By late 1964, relations between Singaporean politicians and people and the rest of Malaysia were severely strained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:35">[07:47:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:43">[07:52:43]</a>. This eventually led to the Malaysian Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, deciding that the only option was to force Singapore out of the Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:21">[08:29:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:39">[08:32:39]</a>.

## Post-Separation Commitment to Multi-Ethnicity
On August 9, 1965, the Malaysian parliament unanimously passed a law for Singapore's separation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:23">[09:09:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:15">[09:19:15]</a>. During his declaration of Singapore's independence, a visibly emotional Lee Kuan Yew, then Prime Minister of Singapore, emphasized the future ethnic direction of the new state:
> "Calling on people to be calm, he promised that there was nothing to fear. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:47">[09:40:47]</a> Singapore would be a multi-ethnic state." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:40">[09:44:40]</a>

Six weeks later, on September 21, 1965, the Republic of Singapore officially became the 117th member of the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:34">[09:47:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:41">[09:50:41]</a>. Despite initial sentiments that the separation might be temporary, a permanent reunification has not occurred, and the idea of a multi-ethnic, independent Singapore has become firmly entrenched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:08">[10:15:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:28">[10:49:28]</a>.

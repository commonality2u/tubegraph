After a brief [[nagornokarabakh_war_of_2020 | bloody conflict]] between Armenia and [[azerbaijan_and_armenian_conflict_in_nagornokarabakh | Azerbaijan]], a [[nagornokarabakh_peace_agreement | peace agreement]] was reached on 9 November 2020 over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This [[nagornokarabakh_peace_agreement | deal]] was brokered by Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Historical Involvement in the Peace Process

Prior to the 2020 [[nagornokarabakh_war_of_2020 | war]], efforts to resolve the Nagorno-Karabakh issue were made under a process led by Russia, alongside the United States and France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. A set of principles were laid down for resolving the problem, including <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>:
*   The return of districts surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijan's control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   The return of internally displaced persons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   A land link between Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   An [[nagornokarabakh_peace_agreement | agreement]] on Nagorno-Karabakh's [[future_of_armenia_and_nagornokarabakh | future status]] to be confirmed by a referendum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   Security measures to underpin any [[nagornokarabakh_peace_agreement | deal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

Despite these apparent agreements on broad terms, efforts to reach a final [[nagornokarabakh_peace_agreement | deal]] prior to the 2020 [[nagornokarabakh_war_of_2020 | war]] did not succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## Russia's Role During the 2020 Conflict

The [[nagornokarabakh_war_of_2020 | outbreak of fighting]] on 27 September 2020 proved much shorter than many expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. After swift Azerbaijani advances, [[nagornokarabakh_war_of_2020 | fighting]] ended after just six weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Russia announced on the evening of 9 November 2020 that it had brokered a [[nagornokarabakh_peace_agreement | peace agreement]] between the sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

Initially, Moscow's response to the crisis seemed uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Given a [[armenia_russia_relations_and_tension | defense agreement between Russia and Armenia]], many expected Russia to come to Yerevan's aid, especially with Turkey openly siding with [[azerbaijan_and_armenian_conflict_in_nagornokarabakh | Azerbaijan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. There were even fears of a serious confrontation between Russia and Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. However, Russia was also keen not to alienate [[azerbaijan_and_armenian_conflict_in_nagornokarabakh | Azerbaijan]] and aimed to maintain its position as a regional hegemon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. Therefore, Moscow chose to play the role of "peacemaker," carefully timing its intervention to maximize its own advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

### Strategic Timing of Intervention
The [[nagornokarabakh_peace_agreement | agreement]] came at a crucial moment for Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>:
*   **Not too soon**: An earlier intervention would have damaged its ties with Baku, which was winning the [[nagornokarabakh_war_of_2020 | war]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
*   **Not too late**: A later intervention, after Nagorno-Karabakh had been completely lost, would have removed Russia's leverage over the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **Preventing blame**: Had Nagorno-Karabakh fallen entirely, Armenians might have blamed Moscow for not intervening to help them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. As it stands, Armenia continues to rely on Moscow to retain what they still hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

## Key Provisions Guaranteed by Russia

The [[nagornokarabakh_peace_agreement | agreement]] specifies that it will be guaranteed by Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Specific elements of Russia's guarantee include:
*   **Peacekeeping Troops**: Almost 2,000 Russian troops will be stationed along the ceasefire line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. These troops will remain for an initial period of five years, with an automatic extension for another five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **Corridor Control**: Russian troops and border guards will control the corridors between Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh, and between [[azerbaijan_and_armenian_conflict_in_nagornokarabakh | Azerbaijan]] and Nakhchivan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

## Outcomes and Future Implications for Russia

Russia is considered a major winner in this situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. The presence of Russian peacekeepers in [[azerbaijan_and_armenian_conflict_in_nagornokarabakh | Azerbaijan]] extends Russia's regional footprint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

The [[nagornokarabakh_peace_agreement | peace agreement]] means that the issue of Nagorno-Karabakh essentially remains in limbo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. While the Nagorno-Karabakh republic no longer exists as a de facto state, there are still loose ends to resolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. Russia, and potentially Turkey, may try to keep the [[azerbaijan_and_armenian_conflict_in_nagornokarabakh | dispute on ice indefinitely]] in order to maintain their respective leverages in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

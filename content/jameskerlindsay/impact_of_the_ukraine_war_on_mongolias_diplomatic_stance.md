The [[Impact of the Ukraine war on Mongolias diplomatic stance | Impact of the Ukraine War on Mongolia's Diplomatic Stance]]

Mongolia's diplomatic stance shifted in early 2022 following the start of the [[impact_of_russias_war_in_ukraine_on_international_relations | Ukraine war]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. Previously, Mongolia had settled into a relatively comfortable position balancing its relations with Russia, China, and its "third neighbours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

## Initial Cautious Approach
At the onset of the conflict, Mongolia adopted a cautious approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. This was driven by a fear of undermining its relations with Moscow and concerns about the implications of imposing sanctions, especially given its continued reliance on Russian energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. Mongolian policymakers initially maintained a neutral course, exemplified by their abstention from key UN votes condemning the invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

## Subtle Shifts Emerge
Despite continued close links with Moscow and regular bilateral meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>, small but noticeable changes in Mongolia's stance emerged as the war progressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. In late 2022, the Mongolian president's call for peace at the UN General Assembly was widely interpreted as the beginning of a subtle shift in the country's approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

## Increased Western Engagement
The most significant development has been a steady increase in contacts with Western countries since the beginning of 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. This includes ongoing high-level engagements with the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a> and growing interest from many European nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>:
*   **France**: In May 2023, Emmanuel Macron became the first French president to visit Mongolia. French officials explicitly stated the visit aimed to loosen Russia's control over its neighbours and explore strategic alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
*   **Germany**: In February 2024, Germany became the first EU member to sign a strategic partnership with Mongolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.
*   **United Kingdom**: The British Foreign Secretary visited Mongolia in April 2024, laying the groundwork for a future partnership agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

## Reasons for the Shift
Several factors may contribute to Mongolia's increased engagement with the West:
*   **Economic Impact**: The [[impact_of_russias_war_in_ukraine_on_international_relations | Ukraine war]] has had a disastrous effect on the Mongolian economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.
*   **Internal Divisions**: There may be deeper internal divisions within Mongolia. While older generations tend to view Russia positively, many younger Mongolians have a more international outlook, preferring the West over Russia and China and expressing support for Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.
*   **Sino-Russian Rapprochement**: There is growing nervousness in Mongolia about the increasingly close ties between Beijing and Moscow that have developed since the war began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. Mongolia prefers to pivot between two powerful neighbours rather than be squeezed between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

For Western states, this engagement offers the chance to weaken one of Moscow's closest historical partnerships and gain greater access to Mongolia's valuable mining sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

## Continued Strategic Autonomy
Despite these developments, Mongolia is not definitively shifting away from Russia and China towards the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. Its geography prevents it from abandoning close ties with its immediate neighbours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. A concerted effort to align with the West could have disastrous consequences if Beijing and Moscow were to align and isolate the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

Instead, Mongolia appears to be pursuing a foreign policy designed to protect its economic, political, diplomatic, and strategic autonomy while maintaining close ties with Moscow and Beijing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. It is not pivoting towards the West, but rather, as its two neighbours grow closer, Mongolia is pivoting towards its "third neighbour": the rest of the world, including the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

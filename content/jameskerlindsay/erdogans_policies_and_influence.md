Under its current president, [[recep_tayyip_erdogans_political_strategy_and_future | Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]], Turkey has sought to reestablish its standing among the world's Muslim-majority states and shape broader opinion on critical issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Most recently, [[recep_tayyip_erdogans_political_strategy_and_future | Erdoğan]] has called for an Islamic alliance against Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This ambition reflects [[erdogans_political_strategies_and_authoritarianism | Erdoğan]]'s view of Turkey as an influential actor capable of galvanizing Muslim opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Historical Context: From Ottoman Caliphate to Secular Republic

Turkey and the Turkish people have a long history at the heart of the Muslim faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. The Seljuk Turks conquered Baghdad in 1055, which was the cultural and political center of the Caliphate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Centuries later, the Ottomans became the most powerful force in the Islamic world, with the Ottoman Sultan also holding the title of Caliph, signifying his leadership of the faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

After the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in the First World War, Turkish nationalist forces, led by General Mustafa Kemal (Atatürk), established the Republic of Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. The last Sultan was forced to abdicate, and the Caliphate was abolished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Atatürk then initiated a strict separation between religion and state, abolishing old ties to Islam and replacing the Ottoman Arabic script with Latin characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Turkey also broke off its ties to the Middle East and the broader Islamic world, prioritizing a Western and European orientation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Turkey joined NATO in 1952 and signed an association agreement with the European Economic Community in 1962 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Notably, Turkey was the first Muslim-majority state to recognize Israel, eventually forging a close defense and security alliance with the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

## [[erdogans_impact_on_turkish_domestic_and_foreign_policy | Erdoğan's Impact on Turkish Domestic and Foreign Policy]]

The direction of Turkey began to change around the turn of the millennium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Amidst economic and political turmoil in the secular republic, the Justice and Development Party (AKP) emerged as a new political force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. The AKP was led by [[erdogans_rise_to_power_and_political_career | Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]], a former mayor of Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Despite being previously jailed for encouraging religious unrest, the military, which historically guarded Turkey's secularism, decided to step back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. In November 2002, the AKP won the national elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. [[erdogans_rise_to_power_and_political_career | Erdoğan]] initially faced a political ban, but it was lifted the following year, leading to him becoming Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

### Domestic Policies under [[erdogans_administration_and_changing_political_outlook | Erdoğan's Administration and Changing Political Outlook]]

From the outset, [[erdogans_political_strategies_and_authoritarianism | Erdoğan]] signaled his intention to reorient Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Domestically, [[erdogans_impact_on_turkish_domestic_and_foreign_policy | he began to roll back many restrictions on religion in public life]], openly highlighting his own religious faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. Key changes included:
*   Ending the long-standing ban on headscarves in government offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   Reducing the power of the military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
*   Stopping the annual tradition of expelling officers deemed too religious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

### Foreign Policy and Increased Profile

Concurrently, [[erdogans_impact_on_turkish_domestic_and_foreign_policy | Erdoğan]] steadily reoriented the country's foreign policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. While maintaining ties to NATO and the quest to join the European Union, Turkey increased its profile across the Middle East and the broader Muslim world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. It massively expanded its diplomatic presence in many countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

The Directorate of Religious Affairs has significantly increased its overseas aid in recent years, building mosques and religious schools, promoting Islamic cultural programs, and distributing humanitarian assistance globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

Turkey has also become more active as a military and security actor, playing a role in reestablishing order in Somalia and intervening in Libya, Syria, and Iraq <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

### Outspoken Positions and Influence

Turkey has become an increasingly significant voice in the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. A Turkish Secretary General led the OIC from 2005 to 2013, and Turkey held the organization's chairmanship from 2016 to 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

Additionally, Turkey has become more outspoken on issues that resonate with ordinary Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>:
*   **Arab Spring**: In 2010, [[erdogans_political_strategies_and_authoritarianism | Erdoğan]] firmly supported efforts to overthrow authoritarian secular regimes in Egypt and Syria, publicly backing Islamist opposition groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. This stance fundamentally undermined Ankara's relationship with Cairo and Damascus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   **Palestinian Cause**: [[erdogans_political_strategies_and_authoritarianism | The Turkish President became a particularly vocal supporter of the Palestinian cause]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. In 2010, Turkey's relationship with Israel collapsed after an Israeli raid on a Turkish aid ship to Gaza resulted in deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. [[erdogans_political_strategies_and_authoritarianism | Erdoğan]]'s continued support for the Palestinian cause gained traction as more Arab states normalized relations with Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. The relationship with Israel worsened further since the war in Gaza, with [[erdogans_political_strategies_and_authoritarianism | Erdoğan]] publicly sympathizing with Hamas and Hezbollah, accusing Israel of genocide, and calling for an Islamic alliance against Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

## Turkey's Standing and Influence in the Muslim World

Turkey's potential as a leader in the Muslim world is supported by significant figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>:
*   **Population**: Turkey is the world's sixth most populous Muslim-majority state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   **Economy**: With an annual GDP of $1 trillion, it is the third-largest economy among Muslim-majority states, after Indonesia and Saudi Arabia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
*   **Military Spending**: Turkey ranks second only to Saudi Arabia in military spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

Beyond these statistics, [[the_transformation_of_turkey_under_erdogans_leadership | Turkey's soft power influence is also increasing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>:
*   **Airlines**: Turkish Airlines has grown rapidly, and Istanbul has become the world's most connected airport, serving over 300 destinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
*   **Cultural Programs**: Turkish television programs are popular in many Muslim countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
*   **Tourism**: Turkey attracts around 45 million visitors annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
*   **Cultural Promotion**: Turkish history and culture are strongly promoted internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

These factors, combined with [[erdogans_political_strategies_and_authoritarianism | Erdoğan]]'s outspoken positions on key issues, suggest a dramatic growth in Turkey's international standing, particularly in the Muslim world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

## [[challenges_and_controversies_during_erdogans_governance | Challenges and Controversies During Erdoğan's Governance]]

Despite its growing influence, there are significant reasons why Turkey's standing may not translate into formal political leadership of the Islamic world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

### Distrust in the Arab World
Turkey remains deeply distrusted in large parts of the Arab world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. This is partly due to the historical experience of 300 years of Turkish Ottoman colonial rule in the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. Many Arab states, including Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, continue to regard Turkey and its leadership with deep suspicion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. Even though Turkey is actively trying to rebuild ties with Damascus and Cairo, and recently attended an Arab League meeting for the first time in 13 years, past behavior and perceived shifts in alliances are not easily forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

### Multi-Alignment Concerns
Many are suspicious of Turkey's attempts to maintain alliances across various blocs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. While courting Muslim states, Turkey remains in a military alliance with the West through NATO, yet it discusses joining BRICS, a group aiming to undermine Western dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. Simultaneously, it tries to lead the Turkic states while also fostering closer ties with Russia, which vies for supremacy in Central Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. Supporters argue these multilateral relationships strengthen Turkey's global standing, but critics see it as proof of [[erdogans_political_strategies_and_authoritarianism | Erdoğan]]'s inability to be loyal, which is not a quality expected of a leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

### Strong Regional Competition
Turkey faces strong competition from other influential actors in the Muslim world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>:
*   **Saudi Arabia**: Remains incredibly influential as the birthplace of Islam and home to its holiest sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.
*   **Egypt**: A demographic and cultural powerhouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
*   **Indonesia**: The world's most populous Muslim state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.
*   **Pakistan**: Also a highly populous Muslim state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
*   **Gulf States (Qatar, UAE)**: Have emerged as hugely influential actors, supported by considerable oil wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
*   **Iran**: Remains the preeminent actor for many Shia Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

For these reasons, while Turkey has undoubtedly reestablished its standing in the Muslim world under [[recep_tayyip_erdogans_political_strategy_and_future | Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]], it is unlikely to become the overarching leader due to opposition and numerous alternative challengers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. Instead, Turkey is better understood as one among many influential countries within this large and highly diverse group of states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

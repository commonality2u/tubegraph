The issue of [[Kosovo declaration of independence and international response | Kosovo's declaration of independence]] has significantly shaped [[Serbias relationship with Russia | Serbia's foreign policy]] and its broader international relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>.

## Historical Background
After the defeat at the Battle of Kosovo Polje in 1389, the Kingdom of Serbia fell under Muslim Turkish rule by the mid-15th century for over 350 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. A conflict erupted in 1999 in Kosovo, a Serbian province primarily inhabited by ethnic Albanians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>. Following the failure of peace talks, NATO launched a bombing campaign against Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>. After 78 days, Serbia capitulated, and Kosovo was placed under UN administration, formally remaining under Serbian sovereignty until a final settlement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>.

## Status Talks and Declaration of Independence
In 2006, the UN initiated status talks for Kosovo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>. The Kosovo Albanians, supported by the United States, Britain, and France, sought independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>. Serbia, however, backed by a more assertive Russia under Vladimir Putin, advocated for autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>. With no agreement reached and the UN Security Council deadlocked, [[kosovo_declaration_of_independence_and_international_response | Kosovo declared independence]] in February 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>.

## Impact on Serbia's Foreign Policy
[[Kosovo declaration of independence and international response | Kosovo's decision to break away]] became the most significant factor shaping contemporary [[Serbias relationship with Russia | Serbian-Russian relations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>. Efforts to prevent [[international_relations_and_recognition_of_kosovo | Kosovo's international recognition]] came to dominate Serbia's foreign policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>.

### Reliance on Russia
Belgrade relied on Moscow to block Kosovo's membership in the United Nations, considered the most important step for recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>. This reliance led to a perceived flourishing of [[Serbias relationship with Russia | Serbian-Russian relations]], including high-level visits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>. Russia gained significant political, economic, and social leverage, taking control of Serbia's state energy provider and expanding its presence in areas like the media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>.

### Equidistant Foreign Policy
Despite the public display of friendship, Serbian officials privately expressed concerns about negative Russian influence on the country, especially its economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>. They argued that while European and Western investment generated jobs and growth, [[impacts_of_foreign_investment_on_serbia | Russian involvement]] yielded little benefit beyond cheap fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>.

Serbia pursued an "equidistant foreign policy" during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>. While it needed Russia and desired close relations with the West, it also valued ties to China and the global South <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>. These relationships were seen as valuable allies in the effort to stop [[international_relations_and_recognition_of_kosovo | Kosovo's recognition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>. Serbia even hosted a summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in late 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>.

### Public Opinion
Public opinion in Serbia was less supportive of Russia than it might have appeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>. While pro-Russian sentiment existed among the nationalist right and the Orthodox Church, many Serbs were primarily drawn to Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>. Polling indicated that most preferred EU membership over closer ties with Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a>.

### Impact of the Ukraine War
The 2022 invasion of Ukraine placed Serbia in a particularly challenging position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:00">[09:45:00]</a>. Serbia tried to balance its stance; it refused to impose sanctions on Russia, unlike most other European states, seemingly fearful of antagonizing Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>. However, Serbia openly condemned the Russian invasion, took in Ukrainian refugees, provided humanitarian aid, and pledged support for Ukraine's postwar recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>. Reports also suggested that Serbia, a major arms producer, supplied Ukraine with over $800 million worth of ammunition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>.

The West's support for Ukraine's use of force to protect its territorial integrity, after having bombed Serbia for similar actions, has fueled anger and accusations of double standards in Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:39:00">[12:39:00]</a>. This has led many Serbs to side with Russia, not necessarily as an endorsement of Moscow, but as a protest against the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:00">[12:51:00]</a>.

## Complexities of the Relationship
The argument that Serbia is merely reverting to traditional pro-Russian sympathies is flawed, as Serbia and Russia have also experienced profound differences despite periods of closeness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>. Similarly, suggestions of Slavic or Orthodox unity are simplistic, given that many Slavic and Orthodox countries have strained relations with Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>.

The idea that Serbia's relationship with Moscow is solely driven by [[international_relations_and_conflicts_influenced_by_kosovo | Kosovo]] is also incomplete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a>. Even if Serbia were to turn against Moscow, it is highly unlikely Russia would reverse its position on Kosovo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:19:00">[12:19:00]</a>. The true dynamic appears to be a changing public opinion, where the Ukraine war is contributing to growing political and social polarization in Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:00">[13:01:00]</a>. While the Serbian leadership may remain broadly pro-European, public opinion appears to be shifting in the opposite direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:00">[13:11:00]</a>.

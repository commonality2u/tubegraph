The Red Sea, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes, has faced a growing threat to vessels traveling through it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Attacks originating from Yemen have led many companies to suspend traffic through the area, causing disruptions to global trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. While the United States has launched a multinational naval task force, there are concerns that this could significantly impact peace and security across the Wider Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Strategic Importance of Yemen and the Red Sea

The Republic of Yemen is situated at the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. Its location, where the Red Sea (connected to the Suez Canal) meets the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean, makes it one of the world's most strategically important locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

Approximately 30% of global container traffic, accounting for about 12% of global trade, utilizes this waterway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. In 2023, around 24,000 ships reportedly passed through the Bab El Mandeb, also known as the Straight of Tears, a narrow passage separating Yemen from Djibouti and Eritrea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.

## Background: The Yemeni Civil War

Yemen has been embroiled in a brutal civil war for almost a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>, primarily affecting regional stability in the Arabian Peninsula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. The conflict received relatively little international attention until the start of the [[military_and_strategic_challenges_in_gaza | Gaza conflict]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

### Rise of the Houthi Movement

The most significant internal challenge emerged in northern Yemen with the rise of Ansar Allah, commonly known as the Houthi Movement. This Islamist group, fighting government forces since 2004, was formed to protect the interests of Yemen's Shia Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>. Iran has supported the Houthis as part of its efforts to destabilize the Gulf region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>.

In September 2014, Houthi forces seized the capital, Sanaa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>. By March 2015, they had reached Aden, the national government's new home, leading President Hadi to flee the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>.

### International Intervention

The conflict escalated dramatically when various Arab states, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, intervened in March 2015. They were supported by prominent Western countries, including the United States, Britain, and France, fearing Yemen would fall to Iranian-backed forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>. The Saudi Coalition initially made progress against rebel forces, rapidly retaking much of the South <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>.

By 2018, the situation in Yemen and the wider region sharply deteriorated. After the Houthis launched missiles against Saudi Arabia, Riyadh imposed an air and naval blockade on the heavily populated North <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>. This blockade left millions in desperate need of food and medical assistance, contributing to what was widely seen as the world's worst humanitarian disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>.

Despite ongoing conflicts and shifting alliances, a Chinese-brokered peace agreement between Saudi Arabia and Iran in early 2023 helped ease tensions, leading to some positive steps like prisoner swaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:00">[10:59:00]</a>. However, the situation in Yemen remains precarious, with two-thirds of the population (around 20 million people) still in desperate need of humanitarian assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>.

## Current Threats to Maritime Security

The [[impact_of_the_yemen_conflict_on_global_trade | war in Gaza]] has significantly heightened the threat to maritime security. Following the start of the Israeli attack against Hamas, the Houthis declared they would attack any ships destined for Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:00">[11:29:00]</a>.

Since then, there have been several major incidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>:
*   A British-registered vessel was hijacked in November and towed into a Houthi-controlled port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>.
*   Numerous drone and missile strikes have been launched against shipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a>. While many were thwarted by US, French, and British warships, several hit their targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a>.

Facing increased danger and rising insurance costs, major ship owners, including Maersk and Mediterranean Shipping Company, have suspended operations in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a>. BP, the oil giant, has also ceased operations for its tanker fleet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>. This interruption to a crucial trade route could have significant ripple effects on the international economy, especially as many countries are grappling with inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:00">[12:27:00]</a>.

## International Response: Operation Prosperity Guardian

The threat to global trade prompted the United States to act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[12:41:00]</a>. On December 18, 2023, it announced the creation of Operation Prosperity Guardian, a new naval task force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:00">[12:46:00]</a>. The task force comprises ten countries (United States, Britain, France, Italy, Netherlands, Canada, Norway, Spain, Seychelles, and Bahrain) and aims to protect shipping in the Red Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>. Notably, it does not include any other Red Sea states or Arab states besides Bahrain, where the mission is based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>.

## Risks and Challenges of Response

While the mission is critical for world trade, there are concerns that it could destabilize the region if not handled carefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:20:00">[13:20:00]</a>.
*   Ongoing peace talks explain why key Red Sea states like Saudi Arabia and the UAE have not joined the mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:28:00">[13:28:00]</a>.
*   Launching strikes against the Houthis, while potentially justifiable, could upset the delicate situation on the ground in Yemen and lead to renewed fighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:00">[13:40:00]</a>.
*   Fears exist that any direct US attack on the Houthis could provoke Iranian retaliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:00">[13:53:00]</a>. Iran's Defence Minister has already warned that the US-led task force will face "extraordinary problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01:00">[14:01:00]</a>.

The United States acknowledges the delicate balance between ensuring maritime safety and avoiding further destabilization in Yemen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">[14:17:00]</a>. For now, the approach involves shooting down drones and missiles but avoiding direct attacks on the Houthis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:27:00">[14:27:00]</a>. However, if the situation escalates or the broader economic effects intensify, there may be calls for more direct action, which could potentially reignite Yemen's civil war and rekindle tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:00">[14:41:00]</a>.

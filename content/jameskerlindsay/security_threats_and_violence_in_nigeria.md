Nigeria, Africa's most populous and resource-rich country, is currently experiencing a deep crisis, grappling with a wide array of serious security threats from north to south and east to west <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The extent of the violence has led to serious doubts about the government's ability to manage the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The sheer scope and scale of the violence are feeding deep concerns about the country's future, leading many to question if Nigeria is collapsing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. On the most recent Fragile States Index, Nigeria ranked 12th out of 179 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

## Historical Context

The [[history_and_development_of_nigeria | history and development of Nigeria]] as a modern state began in the late 19th century when Britain established two colonial territories, the Northern and Southern Nigerian Protectorates, which were merged in 1914 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. In 1954, as Britain prepared for decolonization, Nigeria was reorganized into a federation of three regions: the Hausa and Fulani-dominated Northern Region, the Yoruba-dominated Western Region, and the Igbo-dominated Eastern Region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Nigeria gained independence on October 1, 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

The first major problems emerged in early 1966 with an attempted coup by southern army officers, leading to reprisal attacks on Igbo people in the north <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Over a million Igbo fled to the southeast, which unilaterally declared independence as the Republic of Biafra in May 1967 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. The resulting civil war was a humanitarian catastrophe, causing up to 3 million deaths from fighting and starvation, and lasted until January 1970 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

## Geographic and Demographic Context

Nigeria, officially the Federal Republic of Nigeria, is located in West Africa, bordering Niger to the north, Chad and Cameroon to the east, and Benin to the west, with the Gulf of Guinea along its south coast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. It is the 31st largest country among the 193 members of the United Nations, covering 930,000 square kilometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Since 1996, the country has been divided into 36 states and a federal capital territory, Abuja <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

Nigeria's population stands at almost 220 million, comprising over 250 ethno-linguistic groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. The largest groups are the Hausa and Fulani in the north, the Yoruba in the southwest, and the Igbo in the southeast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. Religiously, the country is primarily split between Sunni Muslims in the north and largely Protestant Christians in the south central and southeast areas, with a religiously mixed population in the center and southwest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Major Security Threats by Region

Nigeria faces insecurity and instability in every part of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

### Southern Regions

#### Niger Delta Insurgency
By the 1990s, deep discontent arose in the Niger Delta due to local communities failing to see wealth from oil production and suffering devastating environmental damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. The military government cracked down on dissent, notably executing leading activist Ken Saro-Wiwa in 1995 despite international calls for mercy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Despite ceasefires and widespread amnesty, many problems remain, and the insurgency continues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

#### Biafran Separatism
The Delta conflict has sparked a revival of tensions in the southeast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. Starting in the late 1990s, Biafran campaigners relaunched efforts for an independent homeland, claiming part of the oil-producing region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. This movement, built on decades of resentment and perceived discrimination following the civil war, has gained prominence with the activities of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and their leader, Nnamdi Kanu, who is on trial for terrorism and separatism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. This has led to widespread protests and clashes with police in the southeast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

### Northern Regions

#### Islamist Insurgency
[[islamist_insurgency_in_the_sahel_region | Violent Islamism]], growing across West Africa, has brought terror to Nigeria's northeast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. The emergence of Boko Haram around 2010 gained international attention in 2014 with the kidnapping of almost 300 schoolgirls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Although Boko Haram has been overshadowed by its rival, ISWAP (Islamic State in West Africa Province), the Islamist insurgency in the northeast has caused over 40,000 deaths and displaced over 300,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

#### Herder-Farmer Conflict
In the northwest, a dangerous threat has emerged due to [[impact_of_climate_change_on_conflicts_in_nigeria | climate change]] leading to greater desertification across the Sahel region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. This has pushed Muslim Fulani cattle herders south into lands held by settled farmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. This "Herder-Farmer conflict," combining elements of [[ethnic_tensions_in_nigeria | ethnic tensions]] and [[ethnic_and_religious_tensions_in_nigeria | religious tensions]], has resulted in over 10,000 deaths and tens of thousands displaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. Well-armed herder bandits are now considered Nigeria's single biggest security threat, increasingly driving tensions in the southeast and southwest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. The encroachment of herders even led IPOB to establish an armed wing, the Eastern Security Network, further destabilizing the southeast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

### Southwest Region

While generally more peaceful, the southwest is also seeing changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. Secretive ultra-violent cult gangs have terrorized Lagos for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. The region is now experiencing violent encroachment by Fulani herders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>, and signs of growing separatist sentiment are emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

A brutal attack on a Catholic church in Owo on June 6, 2022, which left 50 worshipers dead, cast a spotlight on the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. While the perpetrators are unclear, the government has blamed ISWAP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. If confirmed, this marks a dangerous new direction for the group, or at least a very dangerous development in the religiously mixed southwest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

### Other Threats
Beyond these major challenges, Nigeria faces:
*   Localised [[ethnic_and_religious_tensions_in_nigeria | ethno-religious tensions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
*   The emergence of armed vigilante groups, many of which are now turning to crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

## Government Response and Criticisms

The authorities claim to be addressing the problem by increasing military and police presence in affected areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. However, critics argue this is insufficient, with police often failing to operate beyond cities and built-up areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. When they do extend their range, they often worsen matters due to allegations of widespread and systematic human rights abuses, including torture and extrajudicial killings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

These actions feed resentment and discontent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. The painfully slow criminal justice system means many arrested individuals wait years for trial, and widespread use of amnesties and pardons for convicted individuals contributes to a sense of impunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

The Nigerian government is also accused of failing to address the underlying, long-term causes of violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.

## Underlying Causes of Violence

Several fundamental issues contribute to Nigeria's insecurity:
*   **Corruption**: Nigeria is consistently cited as one of the most corrupt countries globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. This means oil revenues are not spent on developing local communities, improving decaying infrastructure, or investing in economic diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. This is a significant aspect of the [[impact_of_government_actions_and_corruption_on_nigerian_society | impact of government actions and corruption on Nigerian society]].
*   **Youth Unemployment**: Nigeria is a young country, with youth unemployment exceeding 40 percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   **Lack of Education**: Nigeria is believed to have more children out of education than any other country in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.
*   **External Factors**: [[impact_of_climate_change_on_conflicts_in_nigeria | Climate change]] and the proliferation of guns and small arms are also major contributing issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

## Future Outlook

The sheer scope and scale of violence have led to concerns about Nigeria's direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. Over the past decade, more than 80,000 people have been killed, and hundreds of thousands displaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. [[future_challenges_and_prospects_for_nigerias_stability | Future challenges and prospects for Nigeria's stability]] include declining government revenues as the world shifts away from fossil fuels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

While many pin hopes on the country's 2023 presidential elections as the best chance to tackle the problems, there are growing concerns that the security situation could prevent the vote from taking place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. The prospect of the state collapsing entirely may still seem unlikely, but Nigeria continues to face an astounding, if not unique, range of security challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. This situation will increasingly call into question the country's future, given the apparent lack of obvious solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.

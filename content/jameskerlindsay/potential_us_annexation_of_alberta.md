While primary international attention has often focused on the [[Quebec independence movement | French-speaking province of Quebec]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, the western Canadian province of [[alberta_separatist_sentiment | Alberta]] has also seen a rise in separatist sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. A less prominent, but notable, aspect of this sentiment is the idea of Alberta potentially leaving Canada to become a U.S. state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

## Drivers of Sentiment

The idea of Alberta becoming the 51st U.S. state is influenced by several factors:

*   **Political, Ideological, and Cultural Similarities** Alberta shares many political, ideological, and cultural similarities with the neighboring U.S. states of Montana and Idaho <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
*   **Economic Reliance on Oil and Gas** Alberta's economy is heavily dominated by oil and gas exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. The support for fossil fuels shown by [[Donald_Trump | U.S. President Donald Trump]] has been widely welcomed in the province <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.
*   **Muted Response to U.S. Policies** While [[Donald_Trump | Trump]]'s policies towards Canada, including tariffs and threats of annexation, have angered most of the country, the response from Alberta has been more muted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. Alberta's Premier, Danielle Smith, who has been accused of flirting with the pro-independence movement, refused to endorse a joint federal-provincial response to U.S. import taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

## Public Opinion

Polling data from 2020 and 2021 indicated that as many as 20% of Albertans favored leaving Canada to become the 51st U.S. state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

## Likelihood of Annexation

Despite some support, the prospect of Alberta's annexation by the United States is considered unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. It remains a fringe viewpoint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. Support for this option may also decline entirely if the negative effects of [[Donald_Trump | Trump]]'s economic policies become apparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.

Instead, the greater threat to Canada's unity lies in the possibility of other Canadian provinces following if Alberta were to break away, rather than U.S. annexation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.

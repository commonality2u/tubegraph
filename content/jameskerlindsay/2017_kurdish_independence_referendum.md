In 2017, [[Kurdish Regional Government challenges in Iraq | Iraqi Kurdistan]] appeared poised to declare independence from Iraq <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. This aspiration culminated in a referendum held in September 2017, which, despite overwhelming support for independence, ultimately led to a severe setback for the region's long-held statehood ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## Background to the Vote

The Kurdish people, often described as the world's largest nation without a state, number up to 35 million across Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. While the [[historical_quest_for_kurdish_independence | Kurdish quest for a homeland]] dates back millennia, their modern aspirations for a state gained significant momentum after the First Gulf War in 1990 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Following a revolt against Saddam Hussein, the United Nations established a no-fly zone in northern Iraq, providing the security needed for the Kurds to establish an autonomous territory known as the Kurdish Region of Iraq (KRI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

This region effectively became a "de facto state," possessing a defined territory, settled population, democratic government institutions, and informal diplomatic ties, leading it to be seen as a "country in waiting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Despite the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 leading to a preference for the Kurdish region to remain part of a new federal Iraq, an informal referendum in 2005 showed almost complete support for statehood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

## Announcement of the Referendum

In July 2014, the Region's president initially announced plans for an independence vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. However, these plans were shelved due to attacks by the Islamic State (ISIS) on the Kurdish region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Independence efforts could only resume after ISIS was largely forced from the area two and a half years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. In June 2017, the regional government announced that a vote would be held in September of that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

## International Outcry and Concerns

The announcement immediately led to widespread opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>:
*   **Iraqi Central Government**: Expressed vehement opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **Regional Powers**: [[Iran and Iraq pressures on Kurdistan | Turkey]], [[Iran and Iraq pressures on Kurdistan | Iran]], and [[Turkey and Syria Kurdistan conflict | Syria]] all opposed any Kurdish attempts to break away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.
*   **Key Allies**: Many close allies of the Kurds, including the United States and Britain, expressed concerns, insisting that the time was not right for a vote and that the focus should remain on defeating ISIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
*   **Sole Supporter**: The only significant international actor to support the plan was Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

## The Vote and Its Results

Despite objections, the referendum went ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
*   **Turnout**: Over 70 percent of eligible voters participated, totaling 3 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: Of these, 2.8 million, or 93 percent, favored independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## Aftermath and Consequences

Hopes that the overwhelming "yes" vote would lead to statehood were short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. A concerted effort immediately began to dissuade the region from breaking away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

*   **Iraqi Government Response**: Faced with losing an area rich in oil and gas, the Iraqi government moved to isolate the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
    *   It suspended all international flights to and from the KRI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
    *   It took control of border crossings with neighboring Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
    *   Iraqi forces seized disputed territory, including the oil-rich region of Kirkuk, which had been captured by Kurdish forces during their battle against ISIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
*   **Neighboring States**: [[Iran and Iraq pressures on Kurdistan | Iran]] and [[Turkey and Syria Kurdistan conflict | Turkey]] indicated they would impose sanctions and other punitive measures if the Kurdish authorities proceeded with their plan, threatening to leave any new state completely isolated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
*   **International Allies**: Key allies clarified their opposition to any declaration of independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. Washington announced it would not recognize the referendum results or an Iraqi Kurdish State created by unilateral declaration of independence, a position shared by other key Security Council members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

## Freezing and Annulment

Faced with overwhelming opposition, the [[Kurdish Regional Government challenges in Iraq | regional government]] had no choice but to back down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. Within weeks, it announced that the referendum results had been frozen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. Two months after the vote, the Iraqi Supreme Court ruled that secession was illegal and annulled the referendum, a decision that went unchallenged by the Kurdish authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

## Long-term Impact

The failed 2017 referendum significantly weakened [[Kurdish Regional Government challenges in Iraq | Iraqi Kurdistan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. It led to increased pressure from Baghdad and Tehran, a collapse in oil revenues, and intensified [[internal_divisions_within_iraqi_kurdistan | internal divisions]] within the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. Once seen as a strong candidate for future statehood, its prospects as a "country-in-waiting" have now seemingly ended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

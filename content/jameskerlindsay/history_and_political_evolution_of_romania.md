## Introduction
Romania, a country in Southeast Europe, recently held the first round of its presidential election on November 24, 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The results led to a shock runoff including a largely unknown far-right candidate, amidst claims of social media manipulation and potential Russian interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. These allegations have prompted calls for investigation both domestically and internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, raising concerns about their significant implications for European security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Geography and Demographics
Romania is situated in Southeast Europe, bordered by Ukraine and [[historical_background_of_moldova_and_romania | Moldova]] to its north, Bulgaria to its south, Serbia to its southwest, and Hungary to its west <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:02">[01:58:02]</a>. Its east coast lies along the Black Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:47">[02:09:47]</a>. The country spans approximately 240,000 square kilometers (92,000 square miles), making it the 12th largest country in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:35">[02:12:35]</a>. Romania has a population of around 19 million, predominantly ethnic Romanian, with numerous minorities including Hungarians, Roma, Germans, Ukrainians, and Turks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:40">[02:21:40]</a>.

## System of Government
Romania operates under a semi-presidential system of government, similar to the French system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:02">[02:34:02]</a>. While the prime minister, appointed by the president, is responsible for domestic policy and leading the government, the president holds a central role in foreign and security policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:13">[02:39:13]</a>. This includes chairing the Supreme Council of National Defense, which comprises key figures such as the foreign, interior, and defense ministers, the head of the armed forces, and the heads of intelligence services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:33">[02:50:33]</a>.

## Historical Overview
### Ancient and Medieval Times
Romania boasts a long and rich history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:47">[03:04:47]</a>. It emerged as a significant Roman province in ancient times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:14">[03:08:14]</a> before coming under Ottoman Turkish rule during the Middle Ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:51">[03:11:51]</a>.

### Formation of the Modern State
The modern Romanian state began to take shape in the mid-19th century with the unification of the principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia in 1859 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:11">[03:16:11]</a>. Twenty years later, Romania achieved complete independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:43">[03:24:43]</a> and became a full-fledged kingdom in 1881 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:16">[03:29:16]</a>.

### World War I and Territorial Expansion
After the First World War, Romania expanded significantly, incorporating important regions such as Transylvania and Bessarabia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:43">[03:33:43]</a>. Bessarabia is now modern [[historical_background_of_moldova_and_romania | Moldova]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:59">[03:38:59]</a>.

### World War II and the Communist Era
Under its wartime dictator Ion Antonescu, Romania initially allied with Nazi Germany before switching allegiance to the Allies in 1944 following a royal coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. Despite this, after the war, Romania, like other Eastern European countries, fell under Soviet control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:12">[03:57:12]</a>. The monarchy was abolished in 1947, and the country became a communist state, known as the People's Republic of Romania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:30">[04:04:30]</a>. In 1965, Nicolae Ceaușescu began his dictatorial rule, which lasted for a quarter-century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:47">[04:12:47]</a>.

### The 1989 Revolution
Ceaușescu's oppressive rule ended in 1989, inspired by revolutions sweeping Eastern Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:47">[04:24:47]</a>. Romanians rose up against him, and Ceaușescu and his wife were captured, hastily tried, and executed on December 25, 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:54">[04:27:54]</a>.

## Post-Communist Political Evolution
### Ion Iliescu's Era
The end of communist rule ushered in a new era for Romania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:24">[04:43:24]</a>. In 1990, Ion Iliescu, a former senior member of the Romanian Communist Party who had fallen out with Ceaușescu, became president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:38">[04:48:38]</a>. Leading the Social Democratic Party (PSD), which became a dominant force in Romanian politics, Iliescu faced criticism for slow economic and political reforms and for maintaining elements of the communist-era structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:07">[04:57:07]</a>. He was defeated by a coalition of center-right parties in 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:37">[05:15:37]</a>. However, persistent problems, including deep-rooted corruption, led to Iliescu's return to power for his second presidential term in 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:17">[05:26:17]</a>.

### Euro-Atlantic Integration
Despite concerns over Iliescu's leadership, Romania made significant progress towards Euro-Atlantic integration in the early 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:19">[05:38:19]</a>. It joined NATO in 2004, strengthening its role in Western security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:04">[05:47:04]</a>.

### Traian Băsescu's Presidency
A few months after joining NATO, Iliescu was again forced from office, losing the presidential election to Traian Băsescu, leader of the center-right Democratic Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:19">[05:54:19]</a>. Băsescu, strongly pro-Western, introduced measures to combat corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:40">[06:05:40]</a>. As a result, Romania joined the European Union in 2007, alongside neighboring Bulgaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:41">[06:11:41]</a>. However, Băsescu's aggressive political style led to problems, including suspension by Parliament and an unsuccessful impeachment referendum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:35">[06:19:35]</a>. He eventually stepped down after 10 years in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:04">[06:33:04]</a>.

### Klaus Iohannis's Presidency
In 2014, Klaus Iohannis, leader of the center-right National Liberal Party, became president, appearing to turn a page after years of political instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:39">[06:38:39]</a>. As a member of the country's German minority, he was perceived as a stable leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:23">[06:50:23]</a>. Though re-elected in 2019, his term produced mixed results, facing domestic controversies like endorsing a coalition with the PSD, which many believed legitimized the country's "corrupt old guard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:25">[06:55:25]</a>.

Nonetheless, under Iohannis's watch, Romania strengthened its position within both NATO and the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:37">[07:15:37]</a>. This became particularly evident after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:25">[07:22:25]</a>. Romania consistently supported Ukraine, providing military and humanitarian aid and serving as a crucial route for Ukrainian grain exports and refugees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:44">[07:28:44]</a>. Iohannis strongly condemned Russian aggression and reinforced Romania's commitments to NATO and the EU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:40">[07:41:40]</a>.

## 2024 Presidential Election (First Round)
Following Iohannis's two terms, Romania went to the polls on November 24 for the first round of the presidential election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:24">[07:51:24]</a>. Thirteen candidates stood for election, with the apparent front-runners being Marcel Ciolacu, the serving prime minister and PSD leader, and Elena Lasconi, a former journalist and provincial mayor representing a centrist and centre-right coalition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:24">[08:15:24]</a>.

In an unexpected outcome, while Lasconi received 19.17% and Ciolacu 19.15%, the most votes (22.95%) went to independent candidate Călin Georgescu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:23">[08:33:23]</a>. This result was considered a "political earthquake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:47">[08:50:47]</a>, marking the first time since the fall of communism that the PSD candidate failed to reach the second round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:18">[08:55:18]</a>. Georgescu, a 62-year-old agricultural engineer, is known for his extreme views and conspiracy theories, including praise for Romania's pro-Nazi leadership during World War II, and being pro-Russian and anti-NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:23">[09:01:23]</a>. He has also spoken out against Romania's support for Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:23">[09:19:23]</a>.

### Allegations of Manipulation
Georgescu's sudden rise in support, contradicting consistent polling showing him below 10%, quickly drew attention to his social media activity, particularly TikTok, where numerous accounts appeared to have amplified his videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:22">[09:24:22]</a>. This led to suspicions of a coordinated effort to manipulate public opinion, with the blame often directed at Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:09">[09:50:09]</a>. Although the Kremlin has denied the allegations, the first-round results have caused considerable concern both in Romania and abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:16">[09:59:16]</a>.

Internally, widespread protests have led to calls for an investigation into Georgescu's funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:39">[10:10:39]</a>. President Iohannis convened the Supreme Council of Defense to analyze national security risks from state and non-state actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:26">[10:19:26]</a>. Internationally, while many NATO and EU partners are cautious about interfering, some have been more direct; the head of the centrist liberal group at the European Parliament called for TikTok's CEO to address the allegations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:43">[10:29:43]</a>. Neighboring [[historical_background_of_transnistria_and_moldova | Moldova]], which shares close cultural and linguistic ties with Romania and has also faced recent allegations of [[russian_influence_in_romanian_elections | Russian electoral manipulation]], has expressed concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:33">[10:57:33]</a>. [[moldovan_identity_and_political_stability | Moldova]]'s pro-European president, Maia Sandu, stated that the two countries cannot let the Kremlin dictate their relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:49">[11:05:49]</a>.

An appeal to the Constitutional Court on a separate technical matter led to a recount, but no evidence of fraud was found, clearing the way for the second round to be held as planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:28">[11:21:28]</a>.

## Implications and Broader Trends
The prospect of Georgescu's presidency has unsettled many, with opponents fearing a shift in Romania's foreign policy away from the EU and NATO towards closer alignment with Russian interests, potentially cutting off support to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44:03">[11:44:03]</a>. Such a shift would significantly undermine NATO and the European Union, especially as neighboring Hungary and Slovakia have grown closer to Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:24">[11:57:24]</a>, raising the "worrying prospect of a disruptive bloc" uniting three of the four NATO members bordering Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a>.

While optimists believe Georgescu is unlikely to win the majority needed, particularly after the PSD won the largest share of the vote in subsequent parliamentary elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:19:15">[12:19:15]</a>, the overall vote suggests that up to a third of the electorate supports nationalist-populist figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:27">[12:44:27]</a>.

The election results underscore critical points:
*   If Moscow is implicated, it would again signal Russia's willingness to use electoral manipulation to undermine Western democracies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:04:18">[13:04:18]</a>.
*   The situation highlights the urgent need to strengthen cyber defenses, combat online disinformation, and ensure the integrity of democratic processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:20:20">[13:20:20]</a>.
*   Regardless of external interference, the vote demonstrates the power of social media to shape political processes in unexpected ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:02">[13:31:02]</a>.
*   It also shows that [[rise_of_farright_politics_in_romania | far-right views]] are becoming more mainstream and resonate with significant portions of society, raising questions about the future of liberal democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:47:04">[13:47:04]</a>.

El Salvador has long struggled with [[historical_context_of_gang_violence_in_el_salvador | gang violence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. In 2015, the country recorded the second-highest violent death rate in the world at 126 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, surpassed only by Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This pervasive issue has had significant and wide-ranging [[impact_on_international_relations | international effects]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

## Migration and its Political Fallout

As killings increased due to [[historical_context_of_gang_violence_in_el_salvador | gang violence]], many thousands of Salvadorians fled the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. By 2016, the scale of this exodus meant that Salvadorians became the second-largest group of unauthorized migrants to the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. They also constituted the largest single nationality legally granted asylum in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

Crucially, images of these refugees, along with people fleeing violence in neighboring Guatemala and Honduras (which also faced gang problems), helped to fuel anti-immigrant sentiment in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. This sentiment played a role in Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential race in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

## International Condemnation of Measures

In response to a sudden spike in violence in March 2022, the government launched another crackdown, declaring an [[el_salvador_state_of_emergency_and_gang_violence | state of emergency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This included mass arrests and other harsh [[controversial_measures_and_human_rights_concerns_in_el_salvador | measures]], such as reducing the age of criminal responsibility and introducing longer prison sentences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

Many of these new [[controversial_measures_and_human_rights_concerns_in_el_salvador | measures]] have been condemned by leading international human rights organizations, including the UN Office for the High Commissioner for Human Rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

One particularly [[controversial_measures_and_human_rights_concerns_in_el_salvador | controversial measure]] was a law criminalizing reporting on gang activities that could "generate panic and anxiety amongst the general population," an offense carrying up to 15 years in jail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. This legislation drew heavy criticism not only from human rights organizations but also from the US State Department, which insisted that "journalists must have the freedom to do their jobs without fear of violence threats or unjust attention" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

### Sanctions from the United States

Concerns about the country's direction under [[nayib_bukele_and_his_approach_to_gang_violence | President Nayib Bukele]] have led to direct actions from the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. In September 2021, the United States sanctioned five Supreme Court judges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. These judges were appointed to rule in favor of a second presidential term for [[nayib_bukele_and_his_approach_to_gang_violence | Bukele]], which contravened a constitutional time limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. This highlights the growing international concerns regarding El Salvador's democratic institutions amidst its efforts to curb [[historical_context_of_gang_violence_in_el_salvador | gang violence]].

Singapore is one of the world's smallest yet most successful countries, having emerged as an economic powerhouse strategically located at a vital crossroads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Its independence from [[the_formation_and_dissolution_of_the_federation_of_malaysia | Malaysia]] is considered one of the most interesting and unique cases of state creation in modern international politics, being the only state explicitly created by being forced out of another country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Geographical and Demographic Overview

The island of Singapore is situated off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula in Southeast Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. It measures approximately 721 square kilometers (280 square miles), ranking 175th among the 193 United Nations members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Its population stands at 5.45 million, composed of a diverse mix of national groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The largest community is ethnic Chinese, making up about three-quarters of the population, followed by Malays (15%) and ethnic Indians (7.5%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. The remainder includes Europeans, Eurasians, and other communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

## Early History and British Influence

Singapore's modern history began in 1819 when British official Sir Stamford Raffles established a trading post on the then sparsely inhabited island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Its location at a crucial junction between the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean proved vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Singapore later became the administrative center for other British settlements on the Malay Peninsula along the Strait of Malacca <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

Britain expanded its influence over the peninsula, with various sultanates coming under its protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. By 1895, some were amalgamated into the Federated Malay States, alongside the Straits Settlements and five Unfederated Malay States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

Singapore's population grew rapidly from a few hundred in 1819 to over 10,000 within five years, reaching 225,000 by 1901 and half a million by 1931 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. This growth was fueled by Malay and Indian immigration, but ethnic Chinese formed the largest community almost from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

During World War II, the Malay Peninsula, including Singapore, was occupied by Japanese forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. After British rule resumed, territories were reorganized: on April 1, 1946, Singapore became a British crown colony, while the remaining Straits Settlements, Federated, and Unfederated Malay States formed the Federation of Malaya on February 1, 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. This separated Singapore administratively and geographically from the Malay Peninsula, leading to greater self-rule over the next decade and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

## Towards the Federation of Malaysia

With British decolonisation in full swing, Singapore's future became a pressing concern, especially after the neighboring Federation gained independence on August 31, 1957 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Despite its crown colony status, many in Singapore believed its place was within the newly independent Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. While there was little immediate economic advantage, the general view was that Singapore, as a small island, could not survive alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

Political leaders in the Federation, however, were cautious due to Singapore's larger population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. They worried that 3.6 million Chinese in a united country would outnumber the Federation's 3.4 million Malays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Wider political concerns, specifically the ongoing communist insurgency in the region, ultimately persuaded them that Singapore needed protection from being overrun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

In April 1961, Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's Prime Minister, proposed the creation of a new state: [[the_formation_and_dissolution_of_the_federation_of_malaysia | Malaysia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. This would include the Federation, Singapore, and three British territories on Borneo: Brunei, Sarawak, and North Borneo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Seven months later, in November 1961, the creation of the Federation of [[the_formation_and_dissolution_of_the_federation_of_malaysia | Malaysia]] was agreed upon with the British Government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

A controversial referendum was held in Singapore on September 1, 1962, offering choices on the form of integration, but not on the merger itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Voters chose considerable autonomy over a complete or unconditional merger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. The union details outlined Singapore's representation in the federal administration, its contribution to the state budget, and the establishment of a common market for open trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

On August 31, 1963, British rule officially ended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. On September 16, Singapore became one of the 14 states of the newly created Federation of [[the_formation_and_dissolution_of_the_federation_of_malaysia | Malaysia]], alongside Sabah and Sarawak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Brunei opted out and remained a British protectorate until its independence in 1984 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

## A Difficult Union and Forced Separation

From its inception, the union proved to be a difficult relationship, both economically and politically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Significant differences between the two entities were magnified after Singapore joined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

Singapore became dissatisfied with the failure to implement the common market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>, while [[the_formation_and_dissolution_of_the_federation_of_malaysia | Malaysia]] felt Singapore was not meeting its financial obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Furthermore, [[the_formation_and_dissolution_of_the_federation_of_malaysia | Malaysia]]'s political leadership was angered when Singapore's ruling People's Action Party contested seats in [[the_formation_and_dissolution_of_the_federation_of_malaysia | Malaysia]]'s April 1964 general election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. The dominant United Malays National Organisation viewed this as an encroachment on their political territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

Against this backdrop, [[ethnic_dynamics_in_singapore | ethnic tensions]] between Malays and Chinese escalated, culminating in riots in Singapore in July and September 1964, which left 36 dead and over 550 injured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. By the end of 1964, relations were under intolerable strain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

Malaysian Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman indicated that if Singaporean politicians continued their path, [[singapores_expulsion_from_malaysia | separation]] would be the only route <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. He later proposed a confederation where Singapore would have full autonomy except for defence and foreign policy, in return for giving up its seats in the Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. However, these discussions failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

By July 1965, Rahman decided to force Singapore out of the Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Singapore's Prime Minister, Lee Kuan Yew, also concluded that separation was the only viable option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Secret talks on the terms of divorce were held, with many government members kept unaware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

On August 9, 1965, less than two years after joining [[the_formation_and_dissolution_of_the_federation_of_malaysia | Malaysia]], a law for Singapore's [[singapores_expulsion_from_malaysia | separation]] was unanimously passed by the Malaysian parliament, surprising ordinary citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Rahman took personal responsibility, stating it was necessary for peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Simultaneously, a visibly upset Lee Kuan Yew declared Singapore's independence, calling for calm and promising a multi-ethnic state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. Six weeks later, on September 21, 1965, the Republic of Singapore became the 117th member of the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

## Post-Separation Outlook and Legacy

The [[singapores_expulsion_from_malaysia | separation]] was initially widely regarded as a temporary measure based on political differences, not a permanent parting driven by fundamental incompatibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. The door for eventual reunification was left open, with many seeing it as inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. Rahman stated Singapore would be welcomed back and later expressed regret at its departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Lee Kuan Yew also expressed regret and left the possibility of reunification to the next generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

However, reunification never occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. Almost 60 years later, there is no organized movement for reunification, though the idea is occasionally floated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. Despite the challenges, there was a persistent sense that Singapore's place was within the wider union of territories that formed [[the_formation_and_dissolution_of_the_federation_of_malaysia | Malaysia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

The [[singapores_expulsion_from_malaysia | expulsion of Singapore]] by [[the_formation_and_dissolution_of_the_federation_of_malaysia | Malaysia]] is one of the most interesting cases in modern international politics where a country appeared willing to shed a troublesome territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Although fundamental political and economic differences made the union uncomfortable for both parties, the situation was resolved peacefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. While [[the_formation_and_dissolution_of_the_federation_of_malaysia | Malaysia]] wanted to be rid of Singapore, Singapore was ready to accept the decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. Thus, what is often seen as a dramatic expulsion can also be viewed as a consensual mutual secession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

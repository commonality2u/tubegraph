Nigeria, Africa's most populous and resource-rich country, is currently experiencing a profound crisis marked by widespread violence and instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This situation raises serious questions about the nation's future and whether it is on the path to collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Current State of Instability
Nigeria faces an extensive and growing array of [[security_threats_and_violence_in_nigeria | security challenges]] across its entire territory, from north to south and east to west <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. These include:
*   **Insurgencies**
    *   **Biafran Separatism:** Decades of resentment and perceived discrimination following the civil war have fueled a renewed push for an independent homeland in the southeast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and its armed wing, the Eastern Security Network, have engaged in high-profile activities and confrontations with security forces, further destabilizing the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
    *   **Niger Delta Insurgency:** Long-standing discontent among local communities over environmental damage and lack of wealth distribution from the oil industry in the Niger Delta continues, despite efforts like ceasefires and amnesties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
    *   **Islamist Violence (Northeast):** Groups like Boko Haram and its rival, the Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP), have brought terror to the northeast, causing over 40,000 deaths and displacing more than 300,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. There are concerns this violence may be spreading to the southwest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **Herder-Farmer Conflict (Northwest and spreading):** Driven by [[impact_of_climate_change_on_conflicts_in_nigeria | climate change]] leading to desertification, Muslim Fulani cattle herders are increasingly clashing with settled farmers in the northwest and central regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. This conflict, combining elements of religious and [[ethnic_tensions_in_nigeria | ethnic tensions]], has resulted in over 10,000 deaths and tens of thousands displaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. It is now considered the single biggest [[security_threats_and_violence_in_nigeria | security threat]] in Nigeria, spreading to the southeast and southwest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.
*   **Organized Crime and Other Violence:** Secretive ultra-violent cult gangs have terrorized Lagos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Localized [[ethnic_and_religious_tensions_in_nigeria | ethno-religious tensions]] and the emergence of armed vigilante groups, many of which turn to crime, further exacerbate the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

## Underlying Causes of Instability
The Nigerian government is widely criticized for failing to address the fundamental issues that fuel the widespread violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>:
*   **Government Ineffectiveness and [[impact_of_government_actions_and_corruption_on_nigerian_society | Corruption]]**: Nigeria is frequently cited as one of the most corrupt countries globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. This corruption diverts oil revenues away from developing local communities, improving infrastructure, or investing in economic diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
*   **Justice System Failures**: The slow criminal justice system leads to long waits for trials, and the widespread use of amnesties and pardons creates a sense of impunity, further feeding resentment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.
*   **Youth Unemployment and Lack of Education**: Youth unemployment exceeds 40 percent, and Nigeria has more children out of education than any other country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.
*   **External Factors**: [[impact_of_climate_change_on_conflicts_in_nigeria | Climate change]] contributes to resource conflicts, and the proliferation of guns and small arms exacerbates violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

## Future Challenges and Prospects for Stability

The human cost of the violence has been immense, with over 80,000 killed and hundreds of thousands displaced in the last decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. The sheer scope of these problems leads to deep concerns about the country's direction and the government's capacity to manage them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

*   **Declining Revenues**: Nigeria faces the challenge of declining revenues as the world transitions away from fossil fuels, which could further strain its economy and ability to address underlying issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   **Political Instability**: While the country's 2023 presidential elections are seen by many as the best hope for tackling the problems, there are growing concerns that the severe [[security_threats_and_violence_in_nigeria | security situation]] could prevent the vote from taking place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.
*   **Risk of State Collapse**: On the most recent Fragile States Index, Nigeria ranked 12th out of 179 countries, just behind [[potential_consequences_of_conflict_for_ethiopias_future | Ethiopia]] (which is in civil war) and ahead of Haiti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. While the complete collapse of the state may still seem unlikely, Nigeria continues to face an astounding and potentially unique range of [[security_threats_and_violence_in_nigeria | security challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
*   **Uncertain Future**: With few signs of improvement and no obvious way out of its current trajectory, Nigeria's future stability is increasingly in question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

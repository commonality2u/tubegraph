Since 2021, various international actors have launched military missions and provided assistance to Mozambique to combat an [[islamic_insurgency_in_mozambique | Islamic insurgency]] in the northern part of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This uprising is considered one of the most serious threats to peace and security in Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The involvement marks a recognition of the severe impact of the conflict, which has resulted in thousands of deaths and the displacement of over half a million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

## Background to the Intervention

An uprising by a group affiliated with Islamic State has been waging a brutal insurgency in northern Mozambique for over four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The group, known locally as Al-Shabab ("The Youth"), launched its first attacks in October 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. They pledged allegiance to Islamic State in April 2018, with formal acknowledgment following in August <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

Initially, Mozambique attempted to manage the insurgency independently, even employing private organizations for assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. However, the situation continued to worsen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. By early 2021, over 2,500 people had been killed in more than 700 attacks, and an estimated 500,000 to 800,000 people (a quarter to a third of Cabo Delgado's population) had been displaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. The UN estimated that 1.3 million people required humanitarian assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

A critical turning point occurred in March 2021, when Al-Shabab launched a major assault on Palma, a port town central to natural gas production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. The attack caused widespread destruction and targeted a multi-billion dollar natural gas plant operated by the French energy company Total, leading to contractor deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Though government forces eventually retook Palma, Total suspended its operations weeks later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. This event underscored the severe threat posed by the insurgency, not only to Mozambique but also to broader regional peace and security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

## Key International Interventions

### Southern African Development Community (SADC)

Following the attack on Palma, the 16-member Southern African Development Community (SADC) held an extraordinary summit in Maputo to address the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. In June 2021, at Mozambique's request, SADC authorized the deployment of a military force known as the "Standby Force Mission to the Republic of Mozambique" to combat the insurgency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

### European Union (EU)

Soon after SADC's decision, the European Union authorized a 300-person military training mission to Mozambique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. This mission, intended to last two years, will provide counter-terrorism training, as well as training on civilian protection and international humanitarian law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. Notably, half of the force will consist of Portuguese troops and will be led by a Portuguese officer, reflecting [[mozambiques_history_and_colonial_past | Mozambique's history and colonial past]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

### Rwanda

While SADC nations awaited final approval for their deployment, Rwanda proactively sent 1,000 troops to Mozambique, who are already engaged in operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

## Broader Context and Outlook

The increased presence of external troops signifies the gravity with which the international community now views the [[islamic_insurgency_in_mozambique | insurgency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. While the link to Islamic State is a particular concern, marking a new foray into southern Africa by Islamic extremism, it is crucial to consider the underlying issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. The conflict is rooted in familiar themes of marginalization, poverty, and disputes over resource revenues, all set against a post-conflict backdrop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

The predominantly Muslim population in Cabo Delgado has provided an outlet for disaffected community members' anger and frustration, but the core issues remain [[socioeconomic_factors_driving_conflict_in_mozambique | economic underdevelopment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. Therefore, while a military response is growing, any long-term solution will also need to address these [[mozambiques_economy_and_natural_resources | economic aspects]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. Ironically, the exploitation of natural gas, a significant hope for development in [[mozambiques_economy_and_natural_resources | Mozambique's economy]], has been halted by the insurgency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. This leaves Mozambique in a vicious cycle of underdevelopment, violence, and further underdevelopment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

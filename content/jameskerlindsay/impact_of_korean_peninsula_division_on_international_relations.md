The division of the [[historical_context_of_korean_peninsula_division | Korean Peninsula]] remains one of the most enduring legacies of the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. It represents a "living fossil of a bygone era in international relations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, with profound and lasting implications for global peace and security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Regional and International Security Threat
The Korean Peninsula's division casts a long shadow over international peace and stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. The relationship between North and South Korea is increasingly unstable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, posing a "worrying new threat to wider regional and international security" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Major powers like the United States, China, Russia, and Japan are deeply involved in the peninsula's security, which further complicates broader international relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## Nuclear Proliferation
[[North Koreas abandonment of unification goal with South Korea | North Korea's development of nuclear weapons]] has added a significantly worrying new dimension to the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. The first atomic test in 2006 drew global outcry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. Currently, North Korea is estimated to possess as many as 30 warheads, with material to produce up to 50 more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. Their rapidly expanding ballistic missile program, including a record number of tests over the past two years, has included launches over Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. By December 2023, Japan believed North Korea had developed a missile capable of striking any point in the mainland United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

## Geopolitical Implications
The division emerged as a power struggle over the peninsula at the start of the Cold War, mirroring the division of Europe into US and Soviet spheres of influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. The United States and the Soviet Union agreed to divide Korea along the 38th parallel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. During the Korean War (1950-1953), the UN Security Council authorized an international force under US command to repel the North Korean invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. The People's Republic of China, allied with the Soviet Union, intervened as North Korea retreated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Without a formal peace agreement, tensions persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. North Korea attempted to pivot between Beijing and Moscow as relations between China and the USSR deteriorated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

The reunification of East and West Germany and the merger of North and South Yemen in the early 1990s offered initial hope for Korea's reunion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. North and South Korea were finally admitted as UN members, having previously been kept out due to their disputed claims and the vetoes of their key Cold War patrons in the Security Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

## Deteriorating Security Situation and International Cooperation
The security situation on the peninsula has steadily worsened over the past two decades as North Korea builds its military capabilities against the South, Japan, and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. Fears about North Korea's direction have been heightened by its expanding cooperation with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. This cooperation gained international attention when Moscow turned to Pyongyang for weapons for its [[impact_of_russias_war_in_ukraine_on_international_relations | war in Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>, followed by a summit between Kim Jong-un and President Vladimir Putin in September 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. These developments raise concerns that North Korea may be moving steadily towards conflict with the South <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

In January 2024, North Korea officially abandoned its long-standing policy of unification with South Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, calling for a rewriting of its Constitution to erase articles on peaceful unification and declaring South Korea its "primary enemy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. This move, while unexpected, has significant implications, suggesting that any future reunification might only occur through war or the collapse of the North <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

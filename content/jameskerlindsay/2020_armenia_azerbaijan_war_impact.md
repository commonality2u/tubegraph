Tensions rose sharply between Iran and Azerbaijan in September and October 2021, less than a year after the [[armenia_and_azerbaijan_conflict | war between Azerbaijan and Armenia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This sudden downward turn in relations appears to be directly related to the [[nagornokarabakh_war_of_2020 | 2020 Armenia-Azerbaijan War]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

The [[nagornokarabakh_war_of_2020 | 2020 war]] saw Azerbaijan regain control of most territories lost to Armenia in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. This victory has changed the [[regional_implications_of_the_armeniaazerbaijan_peace_agreement | regional geopolitical landscape]] in three significant ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

## Shift in Bilateral Relations between Azerbaijan and Iran

The [[nagornokarabakh_war_of_2020 | 2020 war]] has shifted the pattern of bilateral relations between Azerbaijan and Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

*   **Increased Azerbaijani Confidence:** Azerbaijan's victory over Armenia has given Baku a new sense of confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. This was demonstrated by Azerbaijan's decision to levy charges on Iranian drivers crossing its territory into Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>, the arrest of several Iranians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, and President Ilham Aliyev's open allegations that Iran was using the link with Armenia to export drugs into Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This new assertiveness could find further outlets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **Rise in Nationalist Sentiment:** The scale of the victory over Armenia has clearly led to a rise in nationalist feelings in Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   **Impact on Iranian Azeris:** It appears to have fueled pro-Azerbaijani sentiment among ethnic Azeris in Iran, as many felt that Tehran should have supported Azerbaijan in the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. This situation has made Tehran nervous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

## Azerbaijan's Relationship with Turkey and Pakistan

The [[nagornokarabakh_war_of_2020 | 2020 war]] has also cemented Azerbaijan's relationship with Turkey and Pakistan, two of Iran's neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

*   **Growing Turkish Influence:** Iran is increasingly concerned about the growing Turkish influence in Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. While relations between Baku and Ankara have been strong since Azerbaijan gained independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>, Turkey played an instrumental role in helping Azerbaijan defeat Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   **Pakistan's Involvement:** Tehran is also nervous about the involvement of Pakistan, its eastern neighbor, in military exercises with Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. Although relations between Iran and Pakistan have recently improved economically, mistrust continues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Iran views Pakistan, a declared nuclear power, as being on the rise, especially given the Taliban's takeover in Afghanistan, which Islamabad explicitly supported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. The participation of Turkey and Pakistan in the "Three Brothers 2021" military exercises in Azerbaijan has compounded Tehran's sense that the geostrategic playing field is changing on its borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

## Azerbaijan's Relationship with Israel

Perhaps most importantly, the [[nagornokarabakh_war_of_2020 | 2020 war]] has cemented the increasingly close relationship between Azerbaijan and Iran's "arch enemy," Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

*   **Deepening Defense Cooperation:** Ties between Azerbaijan and Israel have been developing steadily since Azerbaijan's independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. They established diplomatic relations in April 1992, making Azerbaijan one of the few Muslim-majority states to recognize the Jewish state at that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. This was one of the first factors to cause a deterioration of relations between Baku and Tehran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. The countries have established close defense cooperation, with Israel supplying sophisticated weaponry, including drones, used in the [[nagornokarabakh_war_of_2020 | November 2020 War]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.
*   **Strategic Foothold Concern:** This growing cooperation now worries Tehran most, as Iran perceives the relationship as giving Israel a strategic foothold on its northern border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

The [[nagornokarabakh_war_of_2020 | 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh War]] has fundamentally changed geopolitics, shifting the Baku-Tehran power dynamic and making Tehran increasingly nervous about Turkish, Pakistani, and especially Israeli cooperation with Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

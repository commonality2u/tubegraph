The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has gained a reputation as one of the world's most dangerous and unstable countries, enduring a perpetual cycle of [[Conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo | conflict and violence]] for the last 30 years that has resulted in millions of deaths and displacements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Throughout this period, [[Rwandas role in Congos conflicts | Rwanda]] has been identified as a critical actor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Recent UN reports have accused Kigali of supporting insurgencies in eastern Congo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Nature of Conflicts

Conflicts are inherently complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. They can be understood as:
*   **Interstate wars**: Traditional armed conflicts between two countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   **Intrastate conflicts**: Also known as civil wars, where competing factions within a country engage in hostilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

The distinction between these forms of warfare is often blurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. A civil war can evolve into a proxy [[Conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo | conflict]] for outside parties or spill over to spark a [[Conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo | conflict]] with a neighboring state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The Democratic Republic of Congo serves as a prime and tragic example of this dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Historical Context of DRC-Rwanda Relations

Having experienced a brutal war at its inception, the DRC was again engulfed in a devastating [[Conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo | conflict]] 30 years later, drawing in many of its neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Although a peace deal was signed around the turn of the millennium, the country has seldom found lasting peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. [[Rwandas role in Congos conflicts | Rwanda]], despite being significantly smaller than the DRC, has played a pivotal role in the developments within its neighbor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. In 2023, a UN expert panel explicitly blamed [[Rwandas role in Congos conflicts | Rwanda]] for destabilizing the DRC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### Geographic and Demographic Overview
The Democratic Republic of Congo is situated in the heart of Africa, bordered by nine countries: Zambia, Angola, the Republic of Congo, the Central African Republic, South Sudan, Uganda, Burundi, Tanzania, and [[Rwandas role in Congos conflicts | Rwanda]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. It is the 11th largest country globally and the second largest in Africa, covering 2.3 million square kilometers (900,000 square miles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Its population is estimated at around 100 million, making it the fourth most populous state on the continent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

In stark contrast, [[Rwandas role in Congos conflicts | Rwanda]] is considerably smaller, with an area of only 26,300 square kilometers (10,200 square miles), approximately one percent of the DRC's size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Its population stands at 13.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Both the Congo and the African Great Lakes region, while known for their natural beauty, have a tragic history of exploitation, abuse, and [[Conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo | conflict]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

### Colonial Legacy and Ethnic Divisions
The region's modern history largely begins with the late 19th-century European Scramble for Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Belgium took control of the Congo, initiating a horrific period of colonial rule marked by atrocities and widespread human rights abuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Belgium also seized Ruanda-Urundi (modern-day [[Rwandas role in Congos conflicts | Rwanda]] and Burundi) during World War I, administering it as a League of Nations mandate and later a UN trust territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

Belgian colonial rule in Ruanda-Urundi was equally brutal, implementing a "divide and rule" policy between the Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This policy had devastating effects upon independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. The Congo gained independence in 1960, followed by Ruanda-Urundi in 1962, which then split into the Hutu-dominated Republic of [[Rwandas role in Congos conflicts | Rwanda]] and the Tutsi-ruled Kingdom of Burundi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

All three newly independent nations faced significant challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. The DRC was unprepared for independence, immediately plunging into a civil war as the resource-rich Katanga province attempted to secede <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. In 1965, Joseph Mobutu overthrew the Congolese government, establishing a brutal one-party dictatorship that plundered the country's resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

Meanwhile, tensions in [[Rwandas role in Congos conflicts | Rwanda]] escalated as the Hutu majority gained control after independence, leading to many Tutsi fleeing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. In Burundi, a Hutu-led rebellion in 1972 resulted in government forces murdering up to 300,000 Hutu, an event often referred to as a forgotten genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

### The Mid-1990s Catalyst
Mobutu's 30-year rule was largely sustained by Western support due to his anti-communist stance during the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. His power waned with the collapse of the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. The catalyst for his downfall came from neighboring [[Rwandas role in Congos conflicts | Rwanda]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

In April 1994, the assassination of [[Rwandas role in Congos conflicts | Rwanda]]'s Hutu president, amid rising Hutu-Tutsi tensions, sparked a genocide that killed over 800,000 Tutsi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Tutsi-led rebel forces eventually overthrew the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. Remnants of the Hutu regime fled into Zaire (DRC), where they regrouped with Mobutu's support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. This prompted [[Rwandas role in Congos conflicts | Rwanda]] and its ally Uganda to back Congolese political opponent Laurent Kabila <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

### The Congo Wars
This support culminated in a full-scale invasion of the DRC in October 1996, initiating the First Congo War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. It was a short [[Conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo | conflict]]; Mobutu's forces were defeated by May 1997, leading to his exile and death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. Kabila took control, renaming the country the Democratic Republic of Congo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

Hopes for democracy and stability were short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Kabila faced criticism for his authoritarianism and growing Congolese opposition to foreign influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. He ordered Rwandan and Ugandan forces to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Their refusal led to the two countries, joined by Burundi, turning against Kabila <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. The [[Conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo | conflict]] proliferated as Kabila gained new allies from Angola, Chad, Namibia, Sudan, and Zimbabwe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. With [[Rwandas role in Congos conflicts | Rwanda]] and Uganda also clashing, this became known as the Great War of Africa, or Africa's World War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

Despite a 1999 peace talk that established a UN peacekeeping mission, fighting persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. The [[Conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo | conflict]] eventually ended after Kabila's assassination in 2001, succeeded by his son Joseph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. A new peace process led to an agreement to end the war in 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. The [[Conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo | conflict]] was devastating, costing over 3.5 million lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

## Persistent Instability and Resurgence of Tensions

Following the war, the DRC appeared to be recovering under a transitional government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Foreign troops began to depart, and insurgents were integrated into the Congolese armed forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. Joseph Kabila was re-elected president in 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. However, underlying political problems remained, with Kabila later accused of corruption and subverting democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

The most severe challenges for the DRC emerged in the eastern provinces of North and South Kivu, bordering [[Rwandas role in Congos conflicts | Rwanda]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. Even after the official end of the war, numerous insurgent groups continued to operate there, vying for control of vital resources or fighting against the Congolese or Rwandan governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

### The Rise and Fall of M23
In 2012, a significant group emerged when mutinous Congolese soldiers formed the [[Role of M23 and FDLR in Congo | M23]] militia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. This group, primarily composed of Congolese Tutsi, received support from the [[Rwandas role in Congos conflicts | Rwanda]]n government, which was still combating Hutu groups based in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

Amid reports of mass atrocities committed by [[Role of M23 and FDLR in Congo | M23]], the United States and the European Union pressured [[Rwandas role in Congos conflicts | Rwanda]] to cease its support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. This led to a peace deal in 2013, where the Congolese government committed to security sector reforms and integrating [[Role of M23 and FDLR in Congo | M23]] members into the national armed forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. Consequently, the intensity of fighting significantly dropped, though other insurgent groups, including offshoots of Islamic State and the Lord's Resistance Army, persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

In 2018, the DRC held its first free and fair transfer of power in 60 years, with Felix Tshisekedi becoming president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

## Current Tensions
As the DRC prepared for its next presidential elections in late 2023, concerns about the security situation in the East resurfaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. The roots of the latest problem trace back to November 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.

Alleging that the DRC government failed to reintegrate [[Role of M23 and FDLR in Congo | M23]] fighters into the national army, the group resumed its activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. [[Role of M23 and FDLR in Congo | M23]] quickly seized significant territory in the East, causing hundreds of deaths and displacing 200,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

The Congolese government accused [[Rwandas role in Congos conflicts | Rwanda]] of supporting [[Role of M23 and FDLR in Congo | M23]], a claim vehemently denied by [[Rwandas role in Congos conflicts | Rwanda]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. However, an expert UN panel's report published in August 2022 supported these accusations, claiming [[Rwandas role in Congos conflicts | Rwanda]] was not only aiding [[Role of M23 and FDLR in Congo | M23]] but also operating troops within the DRC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

To de-escalate the crisis, the East African Community (EAC), which includes both the DRC and [[Rwandas role in Congos conflicts | Rwanda]], convened talks later in 2022, leading to a [[Role of M23 and FDLR in Congo | M23]] ceasefire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. Despite hopes for reduced tensions, the latest UN group report, published in June 2023, insisted that [[Rwandas role in Congos conflicts | Rwanda]] continued to support [[Role of M23 and FDLR in Congo | M23]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. Although the [[Rwandas role in Congos conflicts | Rwanda]]n government has angrily denied these claims, the report has been endorsed by the three Western members of the UN Security Council: Britain, France, and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.

This situation has fueled speculation about a new war between the DRC and [[Rwandas role in Congos conflicts | Rwanda]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. In a practical sense, they are already engaged in [[Rwandas role in Congos conflicts | conflict]] as their armed forces and proxies continue to fight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. The hope is that international pressure can prevent further escalation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. Nevertheless, with over 100 militias still operating along the DRC-Rwanda border, Eastern Congo remains one of the most dangerous and unstable war zones globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

Fears have been growing that Russia is preparing to launch a full-scale [[russias_invasion_of_ukraine | invasion of Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Russia had amassed over 100,000 troops near the border and imposed "unacceptable conditions" for de-escalation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This has led to concerns that Moscow could initiate a dangerous new phase in the conflict in eastern Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Deciding on War

The decision to use armed force is not taken lightly due to potentially huge implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Beyond military aspects, wider political, economic, domestic, and international factors must be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Even if a war is militarily winnable, its broader effects can be extremely damaging, leading to a "pyrrhic victory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. A decision for military action requires weighing a complex range of costs and benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The debate over whether Russia will launch a full-scale [[russias_invasion_of_ukraine | invasion of Ukraine]] is a key example of this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Background to the Conflict

Ukraine is located in Eastern Europe, covering 600,000 square kilometers (200,000 square miles), making it the 45th largest UN member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Its population is approximately 44 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. The 2001 census indicated that 78% were ethnic Ukrainians, while Russians comprised about 17% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Russia, to Ukraine's northeast, is the world's largest country at 17 million square kilometers (6.6 million square miles), with a population of about 144 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

The current crisis stems from the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. After independence, Russia and Ukraine had outstanding issues, including nuclear weapons in Ukraine and the status of the Soviet fleet in the Crimean Peninsula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Crimea had been ceded by Russia to Ukraine in the 1950s, which many Russians resented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Issues were resolved when Ukraine transferred missiles to Russia in exchange for a Russian guarantee to respect its sovereignty and territorial integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Later, the navy was divided, and Russia secured control over a port in Crimea until 2017, later extended to 2042 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

While Ukraine joined the Commonwealth of Independent States (a loose Russian-led organization), many Ukrainians advocated for closer Western ties, including EU and NATO membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This escalated in November 2013 when Ukraine's pro-Russian president blocked an EU association agreement, leading to mass protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. As the president fled to Russia, counter-protests emerged in Russian-speaking eastern and southern Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This prompted Russia to invade and annex Crimea, then support a separatist insurgency in the two Russian-dominated eastern provinces known as the Donbas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

Although ceasefire agreements envisioned Russian troop withdrawal in exchange for decentralized power in the Donbas, fighting continued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. By 2020, the conflict had claimed 14,000 lives and displaced 1.5 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Russia solidified control in the east by granting Russian citizenship to inhabitants and openly stated its desire for Ukraine to remain in Russia's sphere of influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Amidst a significant troop buildup, Russian President Vladimir Putin published an essay insisting that Russians and Ukrainians were one people and that "the true sovereignty of Ukraine is possible only in partnership with Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

In December 2021, Moscow presented the United States and NATO with two draft treaties, outlining a new security relationship and demanding NATO cease further expansion, including to Ukraine or any former USSR part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. NATO immediately rejected this, stating that membership is a matter for the organization and applicants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## Current Troop Buildup

The Russian buildup has continued, with estimates of around 120,000 troops within 200 kilometers (120 miles) of the border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. This has fueled widespread [[potential_russian_invasion_of_ukraine | fears of an invasion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. While some dismiss this as posturing, the context has changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Explicit statements about Ukraine's future being tied to Russia and direct calls for NATO to avoid expansion into the former Soviet Union signal stronger Russian resolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Given NATO's rejection, it may be difficult for Russia to back down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

## Potential Russian Objectives

An invasion would likely no longer be solely about protecting ethnic Russians in the east, as Moscow already controls key ethnic Russian districts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Further expansion would be into areas predominantly inhabited by ethnic Ukrainians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

*   **Full Occupation**: A full occupation of Ukraine seems unlikely due to the enormous military, economic, political, and diplomatic costs of taking and holding the entire country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
*   **Partial Invasion**: A partial invasion might merely make the rest of Ukraine even more anti-Russian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.
*   **Controlling NATO Expansion**: While Moscow views NATO as a threat and claims NATO promised not to expand after the Cold War, an invasion might not fundamentally change the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. While NATO might hesitate to integrate a country with ongoing conflict, Ukraine's NATO membership has long been an unrealistic prospect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. An invasion could even encourage NATO enlargement elsewhere, notably with Finland, a neutral country, hinting at membership given its 1300-kilometer (840 mile) border with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
*   **Securing Existing Gains**: The most plausible objective for an invasion would be to stop NATO's enlargement to Ukraine and secure Russia's hold over territories it already controls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. By invading a large part of eastern Ukraine, Moscow might leverage this to formally secure Ukraine's acceptance of Russia's annexation of Crimea and perhaps the formal transfer of the Donbas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Even without immediate formal acceptance, Russia would see it as a powerful message about its place in the world and its willingness to act in its own interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

## Factors Affecting the Decision to Invade

### Military Risk
While Russia's forces vastly outnumber Ukraine's, Kyiv has significantly improved its military capabilities since 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Observers suggest a successful invasion might require even greater Russian numbers than currently assembled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. Direct outside military support for Ukraine would be limited; no country will fight Russia for Ukraine, as going to war with Russia is "out of the question" for NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. However, NATO has warned that further aggression would have "massive consequences" and a "high price," a sentiment echoed by the EU and US President Biden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

### Political Implications
The political effects of an invasion would be mixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. As a veto-wielding permanent member of the UN Security Council, Russia would face no formal UN Security Council resolution against its actions, though there might be one from the General Assembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. Any action would lead to further political estrangement from the West, but Russia has already distanced itself from Europe and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. Many other countries would be ambivalent about taking tough action, as Russia retains significant influence and is adept at leveraging its capabilities for geopolitical advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. President Putin may feel he can bear any new political costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

### Economic Implications
EU and NATO action would be most effective economically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. Many sanctions have been imposed since 2013, but other areas could still be targeted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Energy, with Europe as a key market for Russian natural gas, is one area for decisive action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. However, Russia's record gold and foreign exchange reserves provide a "huge war chest" to weather immediate sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Putin also knows that cutting off energy would significantly impact already high energy prices in Europe, incurring a major domestic political cost for Western countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

A longer-term option would be to shift away from Russian energy sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken suggested Germany cancel Nord Stream 2, a gas pipeline bypassing Ukraine to link Russia and Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. While this would hit Russia hard, especially as Germany is its largest gas market, the impact would not be immediate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. Cancellation would also raise concerns about Europe's long-term energy strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. While the US sees Nord Stream 2 as leverage over Russia, Moscow and many in the EU view it as Russian leverage over Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

## Conclusion

It remains uncertain whether Russia will invade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. An invasion could meet Russian goals by deterring NATO enlargement to Ukraine, providing leverage to secure existing gains in the east, and sending a message about Russia's resolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. Although military costs could be high, Russia knows external intervention is highly improbable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. The decision depends on Russia's objectives and its perceived ability to withstand the longer-term political and economic effects, which may be less severe than commonly believed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. Thus, the threat of an [[potential_russian_invasion_of_ukraine | invasion]] appears very real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. Even if Russia holds off now and diplomatic efforts succeed, the possibility of eventual military action remains a "very real prospect for the foreseeable future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

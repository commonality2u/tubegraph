## South Africa's Case Against Israel
On January 11, 2024, hearings commenced at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague, Netherlands, concerning [[south_africas_genocide_case_against_israel | South Africa's claim]] that Israel has been committing genocide in Gaza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The case has sharply divided international opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

The roots of South Africa's case stem from the conflict that erupted in late 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. Following [[hamas_attack_on_israel_and_its_consequences | Hamas's attack on Israel]] on October 7, which resulted in 1200 deaths and thousands wounded, and hundreds taken prisoner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>, [[military_and_strategic_challenges_in_gaza | Israeli forces launched a significant air operation against Gaza]], followed by a ground invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. This operation has reportedly killed at least 23,000 Palestinians, including over 7,000 children, and displaced almost 2 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. A total blockade on Gaza has also led to severe shortages of food, medical supplies, and disruptions to essential services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

The UN Secretary-General has described the situation in Gaza as a humanitarian catastrophe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, leading to growing claims that Israel's actions exceed a legitimate operation to defeat Hamas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. South Africa, building on its long-standing support for Palestinians rooted in historical links between the Palestinian Liberation Organization and South Africa's African National Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>, instituted proceedings against Israel under the Genocide Convention on December 29, 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. It argued that Israel's actions were intended to destroy a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial, and ethnical group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

## Israel's Counter-Arguments
Israel had its opportunity to respond to the allegations on January 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>, categorically rejecting the accusations of genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Israel described South Africa's claims as a "profoundly distorted view of the situation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>, arguing that its invasion of Gaza was a legitimate and justified act of self-defense following the Hamas attack in October <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

Key points of Israel's defense included:
*   **Denial of Incitement:** Israel denied accusations that its leaders had incited genocide, claiming that comments had been taken out of context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   **Hamas Responsibility for Casualties:** It insisted that many deaths and injuries were caused by Hamas, which used civilian buildings, including hospitals and schools, for military purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Hamas was also accused of laying mines and booby traps across Gaza, leading to building collapses and widespread civilian casualties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
*   **Hamas's Ideology:** The Israeli legal team "turned the tables on Hamas," highlighting that the group's underlying ideology is the destruction of Israel and the Jewish people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. They argued that Hamas was the party guilty of genocide, not Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

## International Reactions to the Case
The case has sharply divided international opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. While many states have supported South Africa and the Palestinians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, others, particularly in the West, have dismissed the claim against Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

*   **Support for Israel:** The United States, Israel's key supporter, maintained that it had not seen any evidence of genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. Other Western states have also argued that while Israel should act with restraint, its actions do not amount to a deliberate policy to exterminate Palestinians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **Against Allegations:** Some observers have argued that the case is essentially about politics, not law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

## Potential Outcomes and Challenges
The ICJ's ruling on provisional measures is expected within weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. The main ruling on whether Israel has violated the Genocide Convention, however, may take several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

The Court has no enforcement powers, but its rulings carry significant moral authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. A ruling against Israel could open the way for further action at the United Nations, including resolutions in the Security Council or General Assembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

*   **Israel's Stance:** The general view is that the Israeli government is likely to ignore any provisional measures that limit its operations in Gaza, arguing a duty to its citizens to continue its campaign until its goals are achieved and security guaranteed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted that the campaign would continue until Israel achieved "total victory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   **Challenging Court Credibility:** Israel appears to be preparing to reject any adverse ruling by claiming it is a politically motivated decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. Mark Regev, a senior adviser to Netanyahu, has openly questioned the Court's credibility, citing concerns about judicial independence in some judges' home countries and potential political pressures on judges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.
*   **Implications for Israel and its Supporters:** If the Court rules against Israel, it would face "colossal damage to its reputation and standing on the world stage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>, which would be profound for a country forged by the Holocaust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. The more significant challenge, however, would be for countries that support Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. They would face a difficult choice: condemn Israel and support measures against it, or reject the Court's decision, thereby undermining the legitimacy of the ICJ and international law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. This could mark another dangerous step away from the established international order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

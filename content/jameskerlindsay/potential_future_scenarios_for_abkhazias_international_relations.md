Almost all breakaway territories, or de facto states, rely on a protector or patron state to survive international isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. They depend on an external power for political and diplomatic support, economic aid, and security against reintegration from the country they broke away from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This reliance on an outside power can cause considerable resentment, especially if the patron exerts significant political or economic control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Conversely, the patron may prioritize its broader strategic interests over the breakaway entity's needs, leading to friction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Current Geopolitical Context

[[Abkhazias historical relationship with Russia | Abkhazia]] broke away from Georgia almost 30 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a> and has relied on Russia for over three decades for much of its political, security, and economic needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Russia formally recognized [[Abkhazias historical relationship with Russia | Abkhazia]] as an independent state in 2008 following the Russo-Georgian war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. While this recognition provided [[Abkhazias historical relationship with Russia | Abkhazia]] with a greater sense of security, Russia has steadily increased its presence, becoming a significant internal actor and strengthening its economic dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

Russian aid and subsidies fund infrastructure, cover large parts of the Abkhaz state budget (including pensions and public sector salaries), and Russian trade, investment, and tourism form the mainstay of the Abkhaz economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Moscow also increased its security and military presence, stationing troops, building bases, and taking responsibility for manning the frontier with Georgia since 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. A strategic partnership signed in 2014 established a joint military force and required [[Abkhazias historical relationship with Russia | Abkhazia]] to harmonize its foreign and defense policies with Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

## Recent Tensions and Their Implications

Despite the promised aid, Russian subsidies to [[Abkhazias historical relationship with Russia | Abkhazia]] have fallen substantially over the past decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. The COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted [[Abkhazias historical relationship with Russia | Abkhazia]]'s tourism-dominated economy, highlighting weaknesses in its health service compared to neighboring Georgia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. Growing fears emerged regarding Russian involvement in the private sector, with Russian companies and individuals increasingly buying local businesses and private properties, driving up prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

A turning point came in November 2024 when Abkhazian authorities proposed a law extending Russian ownership of local companies and land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. This sparked protests, leading to the storming of the Abkhaz parliament and other government buildings amid claims that the law would allow Russia to completely dominate [[Abkhazias historical relationship with Russia | Abkhazia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. The Abkhaz president, Aslan Bzhania, resigned on November 19, 2024, citing the need to maintain stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

While Russian domination is certainly feeding resentment, this unrest is not unprecedented, with three leaders forced from power since 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. [[Abkhazias current political unrest | Protesters in Abkhazia]] even carried Russian flags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>, and the Russian government kept its distance, not intervening to support the leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

## Future Scenarios

*   **Continued Reliance on Russia:** Despite anger and frustration over Russia's role, [[Abkhazias current political unrest | Abkhazia]] cannot simply turn against its patron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. As long as [[Abkhazias historical relationship with Russia | Abkhazia]] remains internationally isolated and unwilling to consider reunification with Georgia, it relies on Moscow for prosperity and protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. For now, most Abkhaz still see Russia as their preferred partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.
*   **Questioning Russian Domination:** The Abkhaz may increasingly question whether a settlement with Georgia is preferable to Russian domination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.
*   **Influence of European Union Membership:** The pull of potential European Union membership could be influential in the future, especially if it leads to more aid and opportunities for young people to work across Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. However, this scenario seems unlikely for now, especially as [[georgias_geopolitical_alignment_and_relations_with_moscow | Georgia]] appears to be moving steadily further away from the EU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.
*   **Entrapment by the Patron State:** Even if de facto states decide that reunification with their former parent state is preferable, they are often so entirely dominated by the patron state—economically, politically, and militarily—that they cannot pursue another path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. This highlights that despite declaring independence, de facto states are invariably anything but independent, becoming wholly dependent on another power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

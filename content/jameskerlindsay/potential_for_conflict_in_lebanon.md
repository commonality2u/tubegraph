Lebanon currently faces the brink of "complete and catastrophic collapse," with the World Bank suggesting it may be one of the worst economic crises of the past two centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Even the UN Secretary-General has called for urgent action to avert disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The country's severe financial meltdown and deep-rooted instability raise significant concerns about renewed [[political_and_territorial_disputes_in_the_middle_east | conflict]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Background to Instability

Lebanon, located at the far eastern end of the Mediterranean, shares borders with Syria to its north and east, and Israel to its south <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. With a population that is approximately 65% Muslim (evenly split between Sunni and Shia) and 34% Christian (with Maronites being the largest Christian group), its complex religious situation forms the backdrop for its problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

The [[History of Lebanons political structure | history of Lebanon's political structure]] and current issues can be traced back to the First World War, when France was granted a League of Nations mandate over Syria and Lebanon in 1920 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Lebanon was separated from Syria, a move that created lasting resentment in Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Crucially, the new "Greater Lebanon" incorporated Muslim areas that had not traditionally been part of the Christian-majority Mount Lebanon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

Upon declaring independence in 1943, Lebanon's main religious groups established an unwritten "National Pact" to preserve the religious balance of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This pact stipulated that the president would always be a Maronite Christian, the prime minister a Sunni Muslim, and the speaker of parliament a Shia Muslim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Parliament was also divided on a 6:5 ratio between Christians and Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

### Civil War and its Aftermath
Lebanon experienced a period of prosperity post-WWII, establishing itself as a commercial and cultural hub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. However, growing pan-Arabism in 1958 and the influx of Palestinian refugees following the 1967 Six Day War and 1948 partition of Palestine significantly impacted its stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Palestinian groups, including the PLO, launched attacks against Israel from Lebanon, leading to [[political_and_territorial_disputes_in_the_middle_east | conflict]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

In 1975, fighting erupted between Palestinians and Christians, plunging the country into a brutal civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. This conflict saw interventions from Syria (1976) and Israel (1978 and 1982) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. The war finally ended in 1989 with the Taif Agreement, which called for the withdrawal of Syrian and Israeli forces, the disbandment of militias, and constitutional changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Despite the agreement, issues such as Israel's continued presence in the south, the presence of Iranian-backed [[hezbollahs_influence_in_lebanon | Hezbollah]], and Syria's enduring control remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Syria eventually withdrew its troops in 2005 after the assassination of Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, but maintained influence through its links to [[hezbollahs_influence_in_lebanon | Hezbollah]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

## Escalating Factors for Conflict

### [[Lebanon economic crisis | Economic Crisis]] and Humanitarian Catastrophe
Since 2019, Lebanon has suffered a financial meltdown, causing its economy to shrink by almost 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. The currency has collapsed, inflation and unemployment have skyrocketed, and over 80% of the population now lives below the poverty line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. The World Bank assesses this [[lebanon_economic_crisis | economic crisis]] as "likely to rank in the top 10 possibly top three most severe episodes globally since the mid-19th century" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

The country faces a humanitarian catastrophe, with widespread poverty, inability to afford basics like food and fuel, and the state struggling to provide essential services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Hospitals lack provisions, public services are limited, and transport is too costly for most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

### [[Impact of Syrian refugees on Lebanon | Syrian Refugee Influx]]
The start of the Syrian Civil War in 2011 led to over a million Syrians fleeing to Lebanon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. With almost a quarter of its population made up of refugees, Lebanon has the highest proportion in the world, placing an "intolerable strain" on the already financially pressured country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

### Political Paralysis and Corruption
The country built up massive debts during reconstruction and by mid-2019 was unable to repay its loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Efforts by the government to impose new taxes to address shortfalls led to widespread protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Political instability caused foreign exchange inflows to dry up, leading to a financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

Further exacerbating the situation was an enormous explosion at the Beirut Port in August 2020, killing over 200 people, injuring 6,000, and causing an estimated $8-15 billion in damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. The Lebanese government has been "wholly incapable" of fixing the crisis, hampered by deep-rooted corruption and vested interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

### Rising Civil Disorder
The brutal [[lebanon_economic_crisis | economic collapse]] has left people increasingly desperate, leading to mass protests and a dramatic rise in crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. There are signs of growing tensions across society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. In October 2021, six people were killed in Shia-Christian gunfights in Beirut, raising the prospect of a return to [[political_and_territorial_disputes_in_the_middle_east | conflict]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

### The [[Hezbollahs influence in Lebanon | Hezbollah]] Factor
[[Hezbollahs influence in Lebanon | Hezbollah]], designated a terrorist organization by the United States, European Union, and many Arab states, has gained significant ground in Lebanon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. It has established its "own state within a state" and is considered one of the most heavily armed non-state actors globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. With seats in parliament, ministers in government, and control over many Lebanese institutions, some argue that [[hezbollahs_influence_in_lebanon | Hezbollah]] may try to take over the country completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

## Wider Consequences and International Concern

The potential for complete state collapse in Lebanon, while a humanitarian disaster in itself, carries worrying wider consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. There are genuine fears it could lead to a new internal [[political_and_territorial_disputes_in_the_middle_east | conflict]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

Furthermore, if [[hezbollahs_influence_in_lebanon | Hezbollah]] were to seize complete control, there would be "a very real danger of a major confrontation with Israel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. The UN Secretary-General, Ant√≥nio Guterres, visited Lebanon in December 2021, calling for urgent action to solve the crisis, underscoring the severity of the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. The fact that both the World Bank and the United Nations have raised the alert about the country indicates the seriousness of the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

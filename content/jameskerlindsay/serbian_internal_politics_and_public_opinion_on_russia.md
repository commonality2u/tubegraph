The perception of Serbia being exceptionally close to Russia is often seen in the context of its refusal to impose sanctions on Russia following the Ukraine war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, the reality of [[Serbias relationship with Russia | Serbia's relationship with Russia]] and the sentiment of its people is far more complex than it might initially appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

## Historical Influences on Internal Dynamics

While [[Historical ties between Serbia and Russia | historical ties between Serbia and Russia]] have existed, the relationship has not always been consistently close. For instance, after the First World War, relations between the Serb-dominated Kingdom of Yugoslavia and the Russian-dominated Soviet Union were limited, as the Yugoslav monarchy feared the spread of communism and kept its distance from Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>. Diplomatic relations were not even established until 1940 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.

Following the Second World War, despite the establishment of a communist state in Yugoslavia, leader Tito broke away from the Soviet Bloc in 1948 due to disagreements with Stalin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. Yugoslavia then remained beyond Soviet control for the rest of the Cold War, steering a delicate course as a founder member of the Non-Aligned Movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>.

## Post-Yugoslavia Political Landscape

After the disintegration of Yugoslavia in the 1990s and the subsequent conflicts, the Serbian leadership under Slobodan Milošević sought support from Russia, but Moscow's post-Cold War weakness limited its ability to help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>. This was evident again during the 1999 Kosovo conflict, where Russia's strong opposition to NATO's bombing campaign against Serbia could not prevent it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>.

The [[Kosovo issue and its impact on Serbias foreign policy | Kosovo issue]] significantly shaped contemporary Serbian-Russian relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>. Serbia's efforts to prevent Kosovo's international recognition led it to rely on Moscow to block Kosovo's membership in the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>. This reliance led to increased Russian political, economic, and social leverage in Serbia, including control of the state energy provider and expansion into media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>.

However, Serbian officials would privately express complaints about the negative Russian influence on the country, especially regarding the economy, arguing that Russian involvement produced little benefit beyond cheap fuel, unlike European and Western investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>.

During this period, Serbia largely pursued an equidistant foreign policy, valuing its ties with Russia, the West, China, and the global South, particularly as the latter were seen as allies in preventing Kosovo's recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>. This approach was further demonstrated by Serbia hosting a summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in late 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>.

Even after the [[impact_of_the_ukraine_war_on_serbia_russia_relations | Ukraine war]], while Serbia has refused to impose sanctions on Russia and maintains high-level contacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>, its position is not as pro-Russian as it seems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:00">[10:18:00]</a>. Serbia openly condemned the Russian invasion, took in Ukrainian refugees, provided humanitarian aid, and pledged support for Ukraine's postwar recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>. Despite these actions, President Aleksandar Vučić has praised ties to Russia, and the new Serbian government includes figures like Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandar Vulin, who has been sanctioned for his links to Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a>.

The Serbian leadership is generally considered broadly pro-European, despite concerns about growing authoritarianism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:00">[13:11:00]</a>.

## Public Opinion on Russia

Public opinion in Serbia has been less supportive of Russia than it may seem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>. While parts of Serbian society, such as the nationalist right and the Orthodox Church, maintain strong pro-Russian sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>, many Serbs are overwhelmingly drawn to Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>. Polling indicates that most Serbs want EU membership over closer relations with Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a>. Furthermore, few Serbs speak Russian, preferring to study English or German <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>.

The Ukraine war has put Serbia in a challenging position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:00">[09:45:00]</a>. The West's support for Ukraine's territorial integrity, contrasted with its prior bombing of Serbia, has fueled anger and accusations of double standards among the Serbian populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:39:00">[12:39:00]</a>. Many Serbs appear to be taking Russia's side not as an endorsement of Moscow, but as a protest against the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:00">[12:51:00]</a>. This situation is contributing to growing political and social polarization in Serbia, with public opinion appearing to shift against the West, which could have long-term implications for Serbia, the Balkans, and Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:00">[13:01:00]</a>.

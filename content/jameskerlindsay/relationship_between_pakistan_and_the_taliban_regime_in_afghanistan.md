In recent months, the [[pakistani_taliban_attacks_and_security_challenges | Pakistani Taliban]] has staged a series of high-profile attacks, raising fears that the group may be re-emerging as a significant challenge to [[pakistans_geopolitical_relations_with_afghanistan_india_iran_and_china | Pakistan]]'s peace and security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This has led to important questions about the relationship between [[pakistans_geopolitical_relations_with_afghanistan_india_iran_and_china | Pakistan]] and the Taliban regime in neighbouring Afghanistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Geographical and Demographic Context

[[pakistans_geopolitical_relations_with_afghanistan_india_iran_and_china | Pakistan]] and Afghanistan are located in South Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **[[pakistans_geopolitical_relations_with_afghanistan_india_iran_and_china | Pakistan]]**: Approximately 880,000 square kilometres (340,000 square miles), making it the 33rd largest member of the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Its population is estimated at around 230 million, ranking fifth in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Afghanistan**: Located to [[pakistans_geopolitical_relations_with_afghanistan_india_iran_and_china | Pakistan]]'s Northwest, it covers 650,000 square kilometres (250,000 square miles), making it the 40th largest UN member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Afghanistan has a population of around 40 million inhabitants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

While both countries are predominantly Sunni Muslim, they are ethnically diverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. A key group is the [[role_of_pashtun_communities_in_pakistan_afghanistan_conflict | Pashtuns]], who speak a language related to Iranian and are spread across South Afghanistan and West/Northwest [[pakistans_geopolitical_relations_with_afghanistan_india_iran_and_china | Pakistan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. They number around 50 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. [[role_of_pashtun_communities_in_pakistan_afghanistan_conflict | Pashtuns]] represent about half of Afghanistan's inhabitants and make up 15% of [[pakistans_geopolitical_relations_with_afghanistan_india_iran_and_china | Pakistan]]'s population, making them the second-largest group after the Punjabis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

## Historical Context of Relations

The [[historical_context_of_pakistan_and_afghanistan_relations | relationship between Pakistan and Afghanistan]] has a long and complex history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

### The Durand Line and British Influence
The modern story of the relationship begins in the 19th century when Britain, having consolidated its position in the Indian subcontinent (including present-day [[pakistans_geopolitical_relations_with_afghanistan_india_iran_and_china | Pakistan]]), began pushing northward into Afghanistan, which was also a target for Russian imperial expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **1855**: Britain and the Emirates of Afghanistan established friendly relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   **1878**: Britain launched another invasion, leading to Afghanistan becoming a British protectorate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **1893**: The border was formally defined along the Durand Line, which divided traditional [[role_of_pashtun_communities_in_pakistan_afghanistan_conflict | Pashtun]] lands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

Afghanistan became a fully independent Kingdom in the 1920s after the protectorate terminated in 1919, and joined the United Nations in 1946 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

### Formation of Pakistan and Border Disputes
In 1947, British rule over India ended, leading to partition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. The Muslim areas in the north formed the new Dominion of [[pakistans_geopolitical_relations_with_afghanistan_india_iran_and_china | Pakistan]], which became the Islamic Republic of [[pakistans_geopolitical_relations_with_afghanistan_india_iran_and_china | Pakistan]] in 1956 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   From the outset, relations between Afghanistan and [[pakistans_geopolitical_relations_with_afghanistan_india_iran_and_china | Pakistan]] were strained as Afghanistan questioned the borders of the new Pakistani State <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   Afghanistan argued that the Durand Line was never intended to be an official boundary and called for the [[role_of_pashtun_communities_in_pakistan_afghanistan_conflict | Pashtun]] areas to be handed over to its control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   This led to significant tensions, with Afghanistan being the only country to vote against [[pakistans_geopolitical_relations_with_afghanistan_india_iran_and_china | Pakistan]]'s membership of the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   Afghanistan also began to support [[role_of_pashtun_communities_in_pakistan_afghanistan_conflict | Pashtun]] separatist movements, leading to diplomatic relations being severed for several years in the early 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. These problems continued even after Afghanistan became a republic in 1973 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

## The Soviet Invasion and the Rise of the Afghan Taliban

In December 1979, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, completely transforming the relationship with [[pakistans_geopolitical_relations_with_afghanistan_india_iran_and_china | Pakistan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. As a close Western ally, [[pakistans_geopolitical_relations_with_afghanistan_india_iran_and_china | Pakistan]] became a vital route for U.S. and international assistance to the mujahideen, the armed Islamic movement fighting Soviet occupation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. This support continued even after the USSR withdrew in 1988 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

After the Soviet withdrawal, Afghanistan descended into civil war among mujahideen groups, creating an opening for a new group to emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   **Emergence of the Taliban**: Drawing on ethnic [[role_of_pashtun_communities_in_pakistan_afghanistan_conflict | Pashtuns]] educated in [[pakistans_geopolitical_relations_with_afghanistan_india_iran_and_china | Pakistan]]'s religious schools, the Taliban (or Students) gained the attention of [[pakistans_geopolitical_relations_with_afghanistan_india_iran_and_china | Pakistan]]'s powerful military and intelligence establishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   **[[pakistans_geopolitical_relations_with_afghanistan_india_iran_and_china | Pakistan]]'s Support**: Seeing an opportunity to gain control over its historically troublesome northern neighbour, [[pakistans_geopolitical_relations_with_afghanistan_india_iran_and_china | Pakistan]] began to support the new group of fighters, leading to the Taliban's rapid growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
*   **Taliban Rule**: The Taliban first emerged in 1994 and seized the Afghan capital, Kabul, by September 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Once in power, they introduced an extreme form of Islamic rule, curtailed human and women's rights, destroyed cultural heritage, and made Afghanistan a haven for militant Islamist groups waging war against the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

## Post-9/11 Era and the Rise of the [[pakistani_taliban_attacks_and_security_challenges | TTP]]

The 9/11 attacks in 2001, carried out by Al-Qaeda from Afghanistan, led to the US and NATO invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. The Taliban was forced from power by the end of the year but remained an active insurgent force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   **[[pakistans_diplomatic_position_and_regional_dynamics | Pakistan]]'s Stance**: Although [[pakistans_geopolitical_relations_with_afghanistan_india_iran_and_china | Pakistan]] had been one of only three countries to recognize the Taliban regime, 9/11 made continued public support impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. [[pakistans_geopolitical_relations_with_afghanistan_india_iran_and_china | Pakistan]] publicly disavowed the Taliban and joined the "War on Terror" but retained close ties with its former allies, providing sanctuary for many of their leaders and fighters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

### Emergence of the [[pakistani_taliban_attacks_and_security_challenges | Pakistani Taliban]] ([[pakistani_taliban_attacks_and_security_challenges | TTP]])
Under increasing pressure to act against the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, [[pakistans_geopolitical_relations_with_afghanistan_india_iran_and_china | Pakistan]] launched a massive military operation in 2004 in the [[role_of_pashtun_communities_in_pakistan_afghanistan_conflict | Pashtun]]-dominated border area known as the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. This incursion, involving 70,000 troops into an area previously off-limits, led to widespread anger among local leaders and [[role_of_pashtun_communities_in_pakistan_afghanistan_conflict | Pashtuns]] who had fought for the Taliban in Afghanistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
*   **2007**: Following a controversial military raid, a new group, [[pakistani_taliban_attacks_and_security_challenges | Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan]] (TTP), also known as the [[pakistani_taliban_attacks_and_security_challenges | Pakistani Taliban]], emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Drawing on various militant groups, the [[pakistani_taliban_attacks_and_security_challenges | TTP]] launched an uprising to end [[pakistans_geopolitical_relations_with_afghanistan_india_iran_and_china | Pakistan]]'s efforts to control the [[role_of_pashtun_communities_in_pakistan_afghanistan_conflict | Pashtun]] tribal areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

### Relationship Between [[pakistani_taliban_attacks_and_security_challenges | TTP]] and Afghan Taliban
Questions immediately arose about the exact relationship between the [[pakistani_taliban_attacks_and_security_challenges | TTP]] and the Afghan Taliban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   **Shared Ties**: They shared close personal and ethnic ties, as well as a broad ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. [[pakistani_taliban_attacks_and_security_challenges | TTP]] fighters also participated in attacks against NATO forces in Afghanistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
*   **Different Agendas**: However, the two groups had different objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. The [[pakistani_taliban_attacks_and_security_challenges | TTP]] aimed to oust [[pakistans_geopolitical_relations_with_afghanistan_india_iran_and_china | Pakistan]] from the tribal areas, while the Afghan Taliban focused on forcing NATO from Afghanistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. For the Afghan Taliban, maintaining good relations with [[pakistans_geopolitical_relations_with_afghanistan_india_iran_and_china | Pakistan]] and its security services was crucial for support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

### Escalation and Decline of the [[pakistani_taliban_attacks_and_security_challenges | TTP]] Threat
The conflict between [[pakistans_geopolitical_relations_with_afghanistan_india_iran_and_china | Pakistan]] and the [[pakistani_taliban_attacks_and_security_challenges | TTP]] escalated in the following years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   **2014 Attack**: In 2014, after a major crackdown, the [[pakistani_taliban_attacks_and_security_challenges | TTP]] attacked an army-run school, killing over 130 children, an act that drew international condemnation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   **Decline**: In the aftermath, the [[pakistani_taliban_attacks_and_security_challenges | TTP]] threat appeared to decline, weakened by the [[pakistans_geopolitical_relations_with_afghanistan_india_iran_and_china | Pakistan]] Army's operations which forced it to relocate to Eastern [[pakistans_geopolitical_relations_with_afghanistan_india_iran_and_china | Pakistan]] and Afghanistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. It also suffered defections to other Islamist insurgent groups, including the Islamic State of Khorasan Province <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

## Afghan Taliban's Return to Power and Shifting Dynamics

As the United States began drawing down its presence in Afghanistan, the relationship between [[pakistans_geopolitical_relations_with_afghanistan_india_iran_and_china | Pakistan]] and the Afghan Taliban gained ground, much to the anger of [[pakistans_geopolitical_relations_with_afghanistan_india_iran_and_china | Pakistan]]'s Western partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   **2018**: President Trump publicly accused [[pakistans_geopolitical_relations_with_afghanistan_india_iran_and_china | Pakistan]] of deceit for sheltering terrorists, leading to the U.S. withholding at least $900 million in security assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
*   **2020 Peace Deal**: [[pakistans_geopolitical_relations_with_afghanistan_india_iran_and_china | Pakistan]]'s "bet" on the Afghan Taliban seemed to pay off in February 2020 when the Trump Administration signed a landmark peace deal with the Taliban, pledging US troop withdrawal in return for assurances that Afghanistan would not become a base for anti-Western groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   **2021 Taliban Victory**: In August 2021, the last US and NATO forces retreated, and the Taliban swiftly swept back into Kabul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

### Post-Taliban Victory Dynamics
While the world greeted the Taliban's return with horror, [[pakistans_geopolitical_relations_with_afghanistan_india_iran_and_china | Pakistan]] saw it as a victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
*   **[[pakistans_diplomatic_position_and_regional_dynamics | Pakistan]]'s Intermediary Role**: Although [[pakistans_geopolitical_relations_with_afghanistan_india_iran_and_china | Pakistan]] refused to recognize the Taliban as Afghanistan's new government, the Pakistani prime minister indicated his country's intention to be a link between the Taliban and the wider world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
*   **Revival of [[pakistani_taliban_attacks_and_security_challenges | TTP]]**: However, [[pakistans_geopolitical_relations_with_afghanistan_india_iran_and_china | Pakistan]]'s hopes of becoming a power broker were premature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. The Taliban's victory in Afghanistan heralded a revival of the [[pakistani_taliban_attacks_and_security_challenges | TTP]], which stepped up its attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.
*   **Taliban's Stance on [[pakistani_taliban_attacks_and_security_challenges | TTP]]**: Despite Islamabad's hopes that the Taliban would rein in the [[pakistani_taliban_attacks_and_security_challenges | TTP]], the Taliban showed little willingness to do so, instead organizing talks between the two sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. A ceasefire agreed upon eventually broke down in November 2022, leading to the latest wave of serious attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

### Resurfacing Border Issues and Changing Relations
The border issue has also re-emerged as a significant concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   **Durand Line Dispute**: In early 2022, a dispute over a new fence highlighted the unresolved status of the Durand Line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. The Afghan information minister explicitly raised the issue of how the line had divided the [[role_of_pashtun_communities_in_pakistan_afghanistan_conflict | Pashto Nation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

Other signs suggest a change in the [[pakistans_geopolitical_relations_with_afghanistan_india_iran_and_china | Pakistan]]-Taliban relationship:
*   The Taliban regime in Kabul appears to have little need or desire for [[pakistans_geopolitical_relations_with_afghanistan_india_iran_and_china | Pakistan]]'s role as an intermediary on the world stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.
*   The Taliban seems to be actively pushing back against Islamabad, for example, by engaging with [[pakistans_geopolitical_relations_with_afghanistan_india_iran_and_china | India]], [[pakistans_geopolitical_relations_with_afghanistan_india_iran_and_china | Pakistan]]'s rival, a relationship that New Delhi is open to developing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

These developments suggest that the Taliban, having regained control in Afghanistan, or at least important elements within it, are happy to push back against [[pakistans_geopolitical_relations_with_afghanistan_india_iran_and_china | Pakistan]]'s efforts to control them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. Their apparent refusal to crack down on the [[pakistani_taliban_attacks_and_security_challenges | TTP]], coupled with references to the contested border and a divided [[role_of_pashtun_communities_in_pakistan_afghanistan_conflict | Pashtun]] nation, will likely be a source of concern in [[pakistans_geopolitical_relations_with_afghanistan_india_iran_and_china | Pakistan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. Having created or nurtured the Afghan Taliban for its own ends, [[pakistans_geopolitical_relations_with_afghanistan_india_iran_and_china | Pakistan]] may now face the possibility that the tide is turning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. If the Afghan Taliban embraces its Pakistani offshoot and builds relations with [[pakistans_geopolitical_relations_with_afghanistan_india_iran_and_china | India]], it would mark a dramatic reversal of fortunes in relations between [[pakistans_geopolitical_relations_with_afghanistan_india_iran_and_china | Pakistan]] and the Taliban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

Over recent months, a dramatic flare-up of fighting has occurred in Somaliland, a region long regarded as one of the most stable and peaceful parts of the [[tensions_and_potential_conflict_in_the_horn_of_africa | Horn of Africa]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The conflict has resulted in hundreds of deaths and displaced over 200,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This violence significantly impacts [[international_relations_and_diplomatic_efforts_of_somaliland | Somaliland's attempts]] to gain international acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Background: Somaliland's Status and Somali Clan Dynamics

Somaliland has operated as a de facto state for over 30 years within the international system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Although it remains unrecognised by any UN member state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>, it has gained widespread acceptance and built ties with countries like Britain and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

The Somali people are distributed across the [[tensions_and_potential_conflict_in_the_horn_of_africa | Horn of Africa]], forming the majority in Somalia, Somaliland, and Djibouti, with significant communities in eastern [[historical_tensions_and_conflicts_between_ethiopia_and_somalia | Ethiopia]] and Northern Kenya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Despite sharing a common language, religion (almost wholly Sunni Muslim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>), and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, they are divided by a complex clan system centred on five main groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>:
*   **Darod**: Largest group, spanning Kenya, [[historical_tensions_and_conflicts_between_ethiopia_and_somalia | Ethiopia]], Somaliland, and northern Somalia (Puntland) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   **Hawiye**: In eastern Somalia, northern Kenya, and southern [[historical_tensions_and_conflicts_between_ethiopia_and_somalia | Ethiopia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Rahanweyn**: In central Somalia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Dir**: In northern Somaliland and Djibouti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Isaaq**: Majority in Somaliland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

Within these, numerous sub-clans exist, such as the Majeerteen, Dhulbahante, and Wasangeli, which are part of the Harti clan (a Darod sub-clan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. These Harti groups are significant in northern Somalia and eastern Somaliland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, contributing to current tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

### Colonial Legacy and Independence
European colonialism in the 19th century divided Somali-inhabited areas among three imperial powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>:
*   **France**: Controlled what is now Djibouti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Britain**: Ruled Somaliland and Kenya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **Italy**: Administered much of present-day Somalia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

After World War II, decolonisation began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. British Somaliland Protectorate gained independence on June 26, 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Days later, on July 1, 1960, the Italian-administered trust territory of Somaliland also became independent, and the two merged to form the Somali Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

### Early Problems and Somaliland's Secession
Despite initial hopes for unification, problems quickly arose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Somaliland, which saw itself as an equal partner, was downgraded in 1961, fueling Isaaq discontent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. In October 1969, a military coup led by General Mohamed Siad Barre installed a new regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This regime abolished the constitution, banned political parties, and pursued a nationalist agenda aiming to unite all Somali people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

This agenda culminated in the Ogaden War in July 1977, when Somali forces invaded eastern [[historical_tensions_and_conflicts_between_ethiopia_and_somalia | Ethiopia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Somalia was heavily defeated when the Soviet Union supported [[historical_tensions_and_conflicts_between_ethiopia_and_somalia | Ethiopia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. The war undermined Siad Barre's power, leading to growing opposition, particularly in the Isaaq-dominated north, which faced brutal government reprisals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

In January 1991, Siad Barre was overthrown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>, leading to the disintegration of the Somali state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Seizing the opportunity, Somaliland unilaterally declared independence on May 18, 1991, within the borders of former British Somaliland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

## Emergence of Puntland and Territorial Disputes

In 1998, as efforts were made to form a new national government in Mogadishu, the northern part of Somalia, which had largely avoided the widespread violence, established its own separate administration: the Puntland States of Somalia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Unlike Somaliland, Puntland explicitly rejected secession and aimed for autonomy within Somalia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. It is largely inhabited by the Majeerteen, a part of the Harti-Darod clan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

Puntland's claims extended beyond existing Somali administrative lines, asserting authority over all areas inhabited by wider Harti-Darod clan members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. This included not only regions in Somalia (Bari, Nugaal, Mudug) but also significant parts of Somaliland's three eastern provinces: Sool, most of Sanaag, and the south of Toghder (known as Cayn) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. This territorial overlap led to a complex series of events and the current crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

### Escalation of Conflict
The conflict began in December 2002 when the then-president of Somaliland, a Dir clan member, visited Las Anod, the administrative capital of Sool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. This sparked anger among local Dulbahante inhabitants, and Puntland forces attacked the president's convoy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. Puntland seized the area in 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>, but Somaliland forces retook control in 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

Many in Sool, however, refused to accept Somaliland's control and also rejected Puntland, leading to the formation of a militia, the Unity and Salvation Authority of Sool, Sanaag and Cayn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. In 2012, they proclaimed an autonomous administration, the Khatumo State of Somalia, seeking self-rule within a federal Somalia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. While Khatumo initially agreed to remain within Somaliland in return for government posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>, parts of the local Sool leadership rejected the deal and appealed to Puntland for support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. This led to renewed fighting in early 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>, with tensions remaining high and extending to Sanaag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

## Latest Flare-up (2022-2023)

The immediate cause of the most recent fighting was the assassination of a prominent political figure in Sool in December 2022, which sparked anti-government rioting in Las Anod <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. A subsequent crackdown by Somaliland security forces left around 20 dead, fueling further violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Somaliland troops withdrew from the city in January 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

On February 6, local leaders declared non-recognition of Somaliland's authority and again formed a separate Somali federal state, SSC Khatumo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Rejecting what they termed Somaliland's "occupation," they appealed to the Somali federal government in Mogadishu for support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. Since then, fighting has intensified, with reports of Somaliland forces shelling Las Anod <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

The conflict has resulted in hundreds of deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. The UN estimates that over 185,000 people are internally displaced, and more than 60,000 have crossed the border into neighboring [[historical_tensions_and_conflicts_between_ethiopia_and_somalia | Ethiopia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

## Wider Implications

Observers recognize this as a growing crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. The European Union noted at a UN Security Council meeting that while international attention focuses on the Somali government's battle against Al-Shabaab, the escalating fighting around Las Anod poses a significant danger to peace and [[tensions_and_potential_conflict_in_the_horn_of_africa | stability across the Horn of Africa]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

The conflict risks a full-scale war between Somaliland and Puntland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. Furthermore, it could undermine the broader relationship between Somaliland and Somalia and potentially ignite a wider clan confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

The instability is intimately linked to the inability to secure a long-term solution to the [[somaliland_struggle_for_international_recognition | political status of Somaliland]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. From a legal and political standpoint, this is a complex problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. Somaliland argues that the territory is unlawfully trying to secede and that the 1960 boundaries should be respected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. Conversely, the clans claim they are not bound to respect what they view as Somaliland's unlawful secession from Somalia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

While some argue that the people of these areas should be allowed to leave Somaliland and either join Puntland or form a separate autonomous unit within Somalia, this is difficult for Somaliland to accept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. The loss of these territories would be a major blow to Somaliland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>, and its government has little incentive to discuss the issue as long as Mogadishu contests its overall status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. The current fighting highlights a larger unresolved problem that many, including the EU, recognize needs to be addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. This situation also underscores how secessionist conflicts can be far more complex than simple ethno-national or religious group clashes, with communities otherwise united still wishing to be apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

Bosnia and Herzegovina, a country in Southeast Europe, is known for its natural beauty but faces deep-seated political difficulties a quarter-century after a landmark peace agreement [00:00:00]. The nation remains profoundly divided with an unwieldy and dysfunctional [[bosnian_political_system_and_reform | political system]] [00:00:16].

## Background to the Conflict

Bosnia and Herzegovina, covering 51,000 square kilometers, shares borders with Croatia, Montenegro, and Serbia [00:01:54]. Its population of approximately 3.4 million is predominantly divided among three main [[ethnic_divisions_in_bosniaherzegovina | ethnic groups]]:
*   **Bosniaks** (formerly Bosnian Muslims) make up about half the population [00:02:15].
*   **Bosnian Serbs** account for around 30% [00:02:22].
*   **Bosnian Croats** comprise about 15% [00:02:24].
*   Other minority communities, including Albanians, Roma, and Jews, make up the remaining 3% [00:02:28].

Bosnia's modern history is significantly shaped by the disintegration of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s [00:02:40]. In March 1992, following the lead of other federal republics, Bosnia and Herzegovina declared independence and joined the UN months later [00:02:50]. This declaration, however, was rejected by the country's Serbs [00:03:02]. With support from Serbia, they unilaterally broke away and formed their own separatist state, [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]] [00:03:06].

Bosnia then descended into a brutal three-way war, as Bosnian Croats also declared independence [00:03:15]. In early 1994, Bosnian Croats and Bosnian Muslims formed a joint entity in the west and center of the country: the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina [00:03:23]. This Federation consists of 10 cantons, each with considerable self-government [00:03:37]. The war with the Bosnian Serbs continued until the Srebrenica massacre of 8,000 Bosniak men and boys in 1995, which prompted intervention by the United States and its European partners to organize peace talks [00:03:42].

## The Dayton Accords

On December 14, 1995, the leaders of Bosnia, Croatia, and Serbia signed the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, commonly known as the Dayton Accords [00:03:59]. This agreement saw [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]], which then comprised 49% of Bosnia's territory, abandon its claim to independence and reintegrate into the state alongside the Federation [00:04:09].

Under the Dayton Accords, most day-to-day issues are handled by the two entities [00:04:58]. The central government is intentionally weak, dealing with only a few key areas such as foreign policy, immigration, and customs [00:05:03]. The structure of the central government also reflects the power of these entities [00:05:09]:
*   The country's joint presidency is made up of two members (a Bosniak and a Croat) from the Federation and one Serb from [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]] [00:05:15].
*   The Council of Ministers is also divided on a two-to-one ratio between the Federation and [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]] [00:05:23].

## Post-Dayton Challenges and Calls for Reform

Initially, the country showed signs of recovery and reintegration, including the creation of a single military [00:05:30]. However, after about a decade, serious problems emerged as the political structures, which entrench [[ethnic_divisions_in_bosniaherzegovina | ethnic identity]], came to be seen as discriminatory [00:05:39]. Attempts at [[bosnian_political_system_and_reform | reform]] failed, leading to hardened positions and increased dysfunction [00:05:49].

Various groups have responded to these challenges in different ways:
*   **Bosnian Serb nationalist leaders** have openly discussed breaking away to form an independent state or uniting with Serbia, both of which are banned under the peace deal [00:05:55].
*   **Bosnian Croats** have begun calling for their own entity, similar to [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]], a position increasingly supported by neighboring Croatia [00:06:07].
*   **Bosniaks**, in contrast, attribute the problems to excessive decentralization, which they refer to as a 'federation within a federation' [00:06:16]. They reject calls for a new Croatian entity and many openly advocate for abolishing [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]] [00:06:26].

## Arguments for Abolishing [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]]

Many Bosniaks and some external observers argue that abolishing [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]] is a clear solution [00:06:39]. They point to:
*   The problematic origins of the entity, which many call the product of genocide [00:06:46].
*   The increasingly difficult relationship between [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]] and the central government [00:06:53].
*   The dominance of nationalists within the Bosnian Serb leadership who reject the very existence of the Bosnian state [00:06:57].
*   Milorad Dodik, the Bosnian Serb member of the presidency, continually threatening a vote on breaking away and working to make the country as dysfunctional as possible [00:07:05].
*   Worrying signs of Serb [[nationalism_and_secessionist_threats_in_bosnia | nationalism]], including graffiti hero-worshiping wartime leaders convicted of war crimes [00:07:28].
*   A growing movement to deny atrocities committed during the conflict, including Srebrenica [00:07:41].
*   The belief that [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]] entrenches the [[nationalism_and_secessionist_threats_in_bosnia | nationalism]] of the past and hinders the country's progress [00:07:48].

## Arguments Against Abolishing [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]]

Bosnian Serbs present a different perspective [00:07:55]. They contend that [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]] is a legitimate entity, underpinned by international treaties, which has been increasingly challenged by Bosniaks seeking its abolition [00:07:59]. They argue that Bosniaks are equally imbued with exclusionary [[nationalism_and_secessionist_threats_in_bosnia | nationalism]] [00:08:12].

While acknowledging that their leadership talks about secession, most Bosnian Serbs believe this is unrealistic and that any attempt to break away would fail [00:08:18]. Many ordinary Bosnian Serbs recognize that the threat of secession is used by leaders like Dodik for political ends [00:08:28]. They also point out that while they identify as Serbs, Bosnia is their homeland, not Serbia, and joining Serbia would make them a "provincial backwater" [00:08:48]. Furthermore, the veneration of war criminals is limited to a relatively small section of nationalists and does not reflect a widespread desire for a return to conflict [00:09:00]. Most people recognize that another war is not the answer [00:09:14].

## The Way Forward

Bosnia undoubtedly requires [[bosnian_political_system_and_reform | reform]] as its governance system has been deemed contrary to basic human rights, impacting ordinary people's lives and leading to stagnation [00:09:26]. This failure to reform also prevents Bosnia from pursuing EU membership, a crucial driver for change [00:09:44].

However, abolishing [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]] is not a feasible solution, at least for the foreseeable future [00:09:57]. [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]], as an entity, is not the core problem; many countries have highly devolved political entities [00:10:06]. In fact, [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]] is considered more functional as a single entity than the Federation with its various units [00:10:13]. There is no realistic way to abolish it without a return to conflict, as Bosnian Serbs would not relinquish territorial control, and there is no international support for such an idea [00:10:22]. Foreign diplomats assert that [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]] is here to stay [00:10:37].

Nonetheless, the evolution of [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]] as an ethno-national entity does entrench many of Bosnia's problems [00:10:42]. It serves as a "lightning rod" for [[nationalism_and_secessionist_threats_in_bosnia | nationalist]] politicians on all sides, energizing their communities and creating a destabilizing vicious circle [00:10:51]. Bosnian Serb talk of breaking away leads to Bosniak calls to abolish [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]], which in turn reinforces the Bosnian Serb message that secession is their only way out [00:11:01].

Abolishing [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]] is not a panacea [00:11:15]. The initial step toward fundamental [[bosnian_political_system_and_reform | reform]] must involve moving away from [[nationalism_and_secessionist_threats_in_bosnia | nationalist]] talking points [00:11:22]. This requires Bosniaks and Bosnian Serbs to accept two key principles [00:11:30]:
1.  Bosnia-Herzegovina is a single, indivisible state that is here to stay [00:11:37].
2.  [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]] is an entity that constitutes that state [00:11:41].

This means Bosnian Serbs must stop questioning the territorial integrity of the Bosnian state, and Bosniaks must stop questioning the legitimacy of [[republika_srpska_and_its_future | Republika Srpska]] [00:11:45]. Only then might the country reach a point where sides trust each other enough for more fundamental, compromise-based changes that can build a sustainable future state for Bosnia-Herzegovina [00:11:55].

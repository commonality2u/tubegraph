The [[Conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo|Democratic Republic of Congo]] (DRC) has gained a reputation as one of the world's most dangerous and unstable countries, experiencing a perpetual cycle of conflict and violence over the past 30 years that has resulted in millions of deaths and displacements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Throughout this period, [[Rwanda and Congo conflict|Rwanda]] has been a critical actor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Recent UN reports have accused Kigali of supporting an insurgency in eastern Congo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

Conflicts are inherently complex, often blurring the lines between interstate wars (traditional armed conflicts between countries) and intrastate conflicts (civil wars within a country) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. A civil war in one country can become a proxy conflict for outside parties or spill over to spark a conflict with a neighboring state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The DRC serves as a tragic example of this phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Despite a peace deal signed at the turn of the millennium, the country has rarely found peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. [[Rwanda and Congo conflict|Rwanda]], though a fraction of the DRC's size, has played a significant role in the events in Congo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. In 2023, a UN expert panel blamed [[Rwanda and Congo conflict|Rwanda]] for destabilizing its neighbor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## [[Historical context of RwandaCongo relations|Historical Context]]

The [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], located at the heart of [[International Relations in Africa|Africa]], is bordered by nine countries, including [[Rwanda and Congo conflict|Rwanda]] to its east <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. The DRC is the 11th largest country globally and the second largest in [[International Relations in Africa|Africa]], with an estimated population of 100 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. In contrast, [[Rwanda and Congo conflict|Rwanda]] is tiny, less than one percent the size of Congo, with a population of just 13.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. The [[African Great Lakes region]] has a tragic history of exploitation, abuse, and conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

### Colonial Legacy
The region's modern history of conflict began with the European scramble for [[International Relations in Africa|Africa]] in the late 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Belgium took control of the Congo, initiating a horrific period of colonial rule marked by atrocities and widespread human rights abuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. During World War I, Belgium seized control of the German territory of Ruanda-Urundi (modern-day [[Rwanda and Congo conflict|Rwanda]] and Burundi) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. While the Congo remained a Belgian colony, Ruanda-Urundi was administered under a League of Nations mandate and later a UN trust territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Belgian colonial rule in Ruanda-Urundi was equally brutal, implementing a "divide and rule" policy between the Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

In 1960, Congo gained independence, followed by Rwanda-Urundi in 1962, which separated into the Hutu-dominated Republic of [[Rwanda and Congo conflict|Rwanda]] and the Tutsi-ruled Kingdom of Burundi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. All three nations immediately faced significant problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

### Post-Independence Instability
The newly independent [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] (not to be confused with the Republic of Congo) was ill-prepared for independence and was immediately plunged into a two-and-a-half-year civil war as the resource-rich province of Katanga attempted to secede <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. In 1965, Joseph Mobutu overthrew the Congolese government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. The country, renamed Zaire in 1971, became increasingly impoverished and corrupt under Mobutu's brutal one-party dictatorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

Meanwhile, [[Rwanda and Congo conflict|Rwanda]] and Burundi also faced major issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. In [[Rwanda and Congo conflict|Rwanda]], tensions escalated as the Tutsi regime gave way to the Hutu majority after independence, leading many Tutsi to flee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. In Burundi, a Hutu-led rebellion in 1972 resulted in the murder of up to 300,000 Hutu by government forces in what many refer to as a forgotten genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

## The First Congo War (1996-1997)
The confluence of these issues occurred in the mid-1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. Mobutu, who had ruled for 30 years largely due to Western support during the Cold War, saw his power wane with the collapse of the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. The catalyst for his downfall originated in neighboring [[Rwanda and Congo conflict|Rwanda]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. In April 1994, after growing tensions between the majority Hutu and minority Tutsi, [[Rwanda and Congo conflict|Rwanda]]'s Hutu president was assassinated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. This sparked the Rwandan genocide, which killed over 800,000 Tutsi before Tutsi-led rebel forces overthrew the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

As the remnants of the ruling Hutu regime fled into Zaire, they began to regroup with Mobutu's support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. In response, [[Rwanda and Congo conflict|Rwanda]] and its ally, Uganda, backed Laurent Kabila, a leading Congolese political opponent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. This culminated in a full-scale invasion of the DRC in October 1996, initiating the First Congo War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. The conflict was short; by May 1997, Mobutu's forces were defeated, and he fled the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. Kabila restored the country's name to the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], ending three decades of Mobutu's rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

## The Second Congo War (Africa's World War)
Hopes for democracy and stability were short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Kabila faced criticism for his authoritarian approach, and many Congolese resisted foreign influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. As a result, Kabila ordered Rwandan and Ugandan forces to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Refusing to comply, [[Rwanda and Congo conflict|Rwanda]], Uganda, and Burundi turned against Kabila <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. The conflict escalated as Kabila gained new allies from Angola, Chad, Namibia, Sudan, and Zimbabwe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. With [[Rwanda and Congo conflict|Rwanda]] and Uganda also turning on each other, the conflict became known as the Great War of [[International Relations in Africa|Africa]], or [[International Relations in Africa|Africa]]'s World War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

Peace talks in 1999 led to a UN peacekeeping mission, but fighting persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. The conflict ultimately ended when Kabila was assassinated in 2001 and succeeded by his son, Joseph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. This paved the way for another peace process, with sides agreeing to end the war in 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. The conflict was devastating, costing over 3.5 million lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

## Ongoing Instability and the [[Role of M23 and FDLR in Congo|M23]] Insurgency
Despite the official end of the war, numerous insurgent groups continued to operate in the eastern provinces of North and South Kivu, on the border with [[Rwanda and Congo conflict|Rwanda]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. These groups fought for control of vital resources or against the Congolese or Rwandan governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

### Emergence of [[Role of M23 and FDLR in Congo|M23]]
In 2012, a significant group emerged: [[Role of M23 and FDLR in Congo|M23]], formed by mutinous Congolese soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. This militia, primarily composed of Congolese Tutsi, was supported by the [[Rwanda and Congo conflict|Rwandan government]], which was still combating distant Hutu groups in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. However, this support was halted due to growing reports of atrocities committed by [[Role of M23 and FDLR in Congo|M23]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. The United States and the European Union pressured [[Rwanda and Congo conflict|Rwanda]] to sever its ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. A peace deal in 2013 committed the Congolese government to security sector reforms and the integration of [[Role of M23 and FDLR in Congo|M23]] members into the national armed forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. This led to a significant drop in fighting intensity, although other insurgent groups persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

## [[Current tensions between the DRC and Rwanda|Current Tensions]] and Renewed Conflict
Concerns about the security situation in eastern DRC resurfaced as the country prepared for its next presidential elections in late 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. The roots of the problem trace back to November 2021, when [[Role of M23 and FDLR in Congo|M23]] resumed its activities, claiming the DRC government had failed to reintegrate its fighters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. [[Role of M23 and FDLR in Congo|M23]] subsequently seized significant territory in the east, causing hundreds of deaths and displacing 200,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

The Congolese government accused [[Rwanda and Congo conflict|Rwanda]] of supporting the group, a claim fiercely rejected by [[Rwanda and Congo conflict|Rwanda]] but later supported by a UN expert panel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. In an August 2022 report, the panel accused [[Rwanda and Congo conflict|Rwanda]] of aiding [[Role of M23 and FDLR in Congo|M23]] and stated that Rwandan troops were operating in the DRC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

In an effort to de-escalate the crisis, the East [[International Relations in Africa|African Community]] (EAC), which includes both the DRC and [[Rwanda and Congo conflict|Rwanda]], convened talks in late 2022, leading to [[Role of M23 and FDLR in Congo|M23]] agreeing to a ceasefire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. However, a June 2023 UN report insisted that [[Rwanda and Congo conflict|Rwanda]] was still supporting [[Role of M23 and FDLR in Congo|M23]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. While the [[Rwanda and Congo conflict|Rwandan government]] denied these claims, the report was endorsed by Britain, France, and the United States, the three Western members of the UN Security Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.

### Outlook
Speculation is growing about a new war between the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] and [[Rwanda and Congo conflict|Rwanda]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. In a practical sense, they are already at war, with their armed forces and proxies continuing to fight in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. The hope is that international pressure can prevent further escalation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. Regardless of whether it becomes a formal interstate war again, eastern Congo remains one of the most dangerous and unstable war zones on the planet, with over 100 militias operating near the border between the DRC and [[Rwanda and Congo conflict|Rwanda]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

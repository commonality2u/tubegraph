In recent years, there has been increasing concern about [[Hungarys political direction under Viktor Orban | Hungary's political direction under Viktor Orbán]], particularly his undermining of Western solidarity over Ukraine and perceived active service of Russia's interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The modern world order, built on multilateralism, relies on international organizations, some of which, like NATO and the European Union, expect members to adhere to shared values such as a fundamental respect for the principles of liberal democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. [[Impact of Hungary on European Union dynamics | Hungary]] has emerged as a significant challenge for both organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

## Hungary's Divergence from Western Values

Since May 2010, when the Fidesz party won a landslide victory, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has progressively introduced measures that contradict the principles of liberal democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>. Despite having previously been seen as an internationalist liberal during his 1998-2002 premiership, when [[Impact of Hungary on European Union dynamics | Hungary]] made significant moves towards Western integration, his second term saw a rapid shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>.

Key actions and statements that prompted concern include:
*   **Restrictions on Freedoms** Orbán introduced measures to restrict press freedoms within months of his return to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>. Although these were watered down after EU pressure, he controversially compared the EU to the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>. He further clamped down on media freedoms, civil liberties, and human rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>.
*   **"Illiberal Democracy"** By 2014, Orbán openly announced his vision for [[Impact of Hungary on European Union dynamics | Hungary]] as an "illiberal democracy" based on a "different, special, national approach" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.
*   **Nationalism and Xenophobia** His overt nationalism included antagonizing neighbors by strengthening ties to Hungarian communities in their territories and adopting an overtly anti-immigrant stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>. During the 2015 Refugee Crisis, he undermined EU solidarity by refusing to resettle asylum seekers, labeling them "potential terrorists" and "intruders," and asserting his belief in a [[Impact of Hungary on European Union dynamics | Hungary]] only for Hungarians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>.
*   **Democratic Decline** In 2019, Freedom House downgraded [[Impact of Hungary on European Union dynamics | Hungary's]] democratic standards to "partly free," noting that Orbán was using his parliamentary strength to control the opposition, media, religious groups, academia, NGOs, courts, asylum seekers, and the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>. Observers began to view [[Impact of Hungary on European Union dynamics | Hungary]] as a corrupt one-party state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>.

## European Union Responses and Challenges

The EU's response to [[Impact of Hungary on European Union dynamics | Hungary's]] democratic backsliding has faced significant challenges:
*   **Difficulty in Enforcement** While organizations like the United Nations exist as discussion forums, bodies like NATO and the EU expect members to adhere to shared values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. However, remarkably few international organizations set out ways to expel a member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.
*   **Orbán's Tactics** Orbán has proven skilled at playing the EU's politics, backing down on controversial measures just enough and when necessary to avoid severe repercussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>.
*   **High-Level Protection** Orbán benefited from protection from the center-right European People's Party, the largest bloc in the European Parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>.
*   **Infringement Proceedings** In 2018, the European Parliament voted to start infringement proceedings against [[Impact of Hungary on European Union dynamics | Hungary]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>. However, any serious action, such as the suspension of membership rights (the "nuclear option"), requires the support of all other member states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>. This was complicated by the fact that Poland had also taken an illiberal turn and served as [[Impact of Hungary on European Union dynamics | Hungary's]] closest ally, effectively blocking such measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>.

## Responses to Russia-Ukraine War Stance

The war in Ukraine brought [[Impact of Hungary on European Union dynamics | Hungary's]] policies to wider international attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>. Initial fears that [[Impact of Hungary on European Union dynamics | Hungary]] would block Western action against Moscow stemmed from the close relationship between Orbán and Putin, as well as strained relations between Budapest and Kyiv over the Hungarian minority in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>.

*   **Initial Stance** [[Impact of Hungary on European Union dynamics | Hungary]] initially surprised observers by opposing the invasion and supporting EU sanctions against Moscow, likely to avoid being seen as too pro-Russian before upcoming elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>. However, it hampered NATO efforts to supply military aid to Ukraine by restricting its airspace for Ukrainian aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>.
*   **Post-Election Shift** After Fidesz won another landslide victory, Orbán, congratulated by Putin, quickly changed his position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>. [[Impact of Hungary on European Union dynamics | Hungary]] became increasingly obstructive, trying to limit further sanctions on Russia and refusing to back EU proposals to reduce Russian gas consumption, ultimately forcing EU members to exempt [[Impact of Hungary on European Union dynamics | Hungary]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>. The country was already in talks to increase its Russian gas supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>.
*   **NATO Enlargement** Alongside Turkey, [[Impact of Hungary on European Union dynamics | Hungary]] delayed the ratification of Sweden and Finland's membership in NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>.

## Recent Actions and Future Outlook

The tide may now be turning against [[Hungarys political direction under Viktor Orban | Viktor Orbán]].
*   **Withholding Funds** In February 2022, the European Court of Justice ruled that EU money can be withheld from members that do not abide by the body's fundamental values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>. Consequently, in September 2022, the European Commission announced plans to withhold 7.5 billion euros of funding from [[Impact of Hungary on European Union dynamics | Hungary]] over persistent public procurement corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>. While Budapest agreed to introduce measures to fix the problem, many remain skeptical, believing Orbán will merely revert to his old ways after addressing the immediate issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:00">[11:50:00]</a>.
*   **Calls for Expulsion** Despite calls for [[Impact of Hungary on European Union dynamics | Hungary]] to be expelled from NATO and the EU, this is unlikely to happen as there is no mechanism for a country to be expelled from either body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a>. Despite Orbán's misdeeds, there remains a deep reluctance to pursue such a radical and unprecedented step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a>.

However, not taking decisive action carries significant risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a>. [[Impact of Hungary on European Union dynamics | Hungary's]] position on democratic standards, civil liberties, human rights, and how to deal with Russia fundamentally conflicts with the values of almost all its EU and NATO partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>. By not acting, both organizations risk undermining their own values and encouraging other members to follow [[Impact of Hungary on European Union dynamics | Hungary's]] path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:04:00">[13:04:00]</a>. The West faces a significant challenge in determining what action to take regarding its [[Impact of Hungary on European Union dynamics | Hungary]] problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15:00">[13:15:00]</a>.

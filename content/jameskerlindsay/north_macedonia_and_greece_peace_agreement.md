In May 2024, a diplomatic row emerged after North Macedonia's new president insisted on using the country's old name during her inauguration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This act caused the Greek ambassador to walk out of the ceremony in protest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Greek and European officials emphasized that adherence to the agreement with Athens is central to North Macedonia's future [[Impact of North Macedonias political changes on EU integration | EU integration process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Background of the Dispute

North Macedonia, a landlocked country in Southeast Europe with a population of approximately 2.1 million, declared independence on December 8, 1991, following the collapse of Yugoslavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. From its inception, Greece objected to the country's name, "the Republic of Macedonia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. Greece argued that the new state was laying claim to its own region of Macedonia and usurping its historical Greek identity by adopting symbols linked to the ancient Hellenistic region of Macedonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.

With support from its European Union partners, Greece ensured that when the new country joined the UN in April 1993, it did so under the provisional name "the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM)" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>. The UN subsequently initiated a process to resolve the name issue, leading to an interim agreement in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>. This agreement saw the Macedonian government change contentious state symbols in exchange for Greece's promise not to obstruct its efforts to join international organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>. However, efforts to resolve the name issue continued unsuccessfully for two decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>.

Beyond the country's title, discussions were complicated by how to describe the country's language and inhabitants, with Greece objecting to the term "Macedonian" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. Relations deteriorated as Athens blocked North Macedonia's efforts to join NATO and the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>. In response, the Macedonian government further asserted claims to ancient Greek heritage, naming its main national airport and highway after Alexander the Great <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.

## The Prespa Agreement (2018)

A breakthrough occurred in 2017 with the election of new governments in both Skopje and Greece that sought to resolve the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. Following intensive discussions, an agreement was reached in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>.

The key terms of the [[Prespa Agreement controversy | Prespa Agreement]] included:
*   **Renaming**: The country would be renamed the "Republic of North Macedonia," to be used in all circumstances, both domestically and internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>.
*   **Language and Inhabitants**: The country's language would remain Macedonian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. Inhabitants would officially be called "citizens of the Republic of North Macedonia," but could continue to call themselves "Macedonians" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>.
*   **Heritage**: The agreement explicitly recognized the country's distinct Greek and Slavic heritage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>.

The two countries signed the agreement at an international ceremony on the shores of Lake Prespa on June 19, 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>. The wider international community hailed the [[Prespa Agreement controversy | Prespa Agreement]] as a significant step for both countries and a positive development for the wider Balkan region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>.

## Ratification and Opposition

Despite international praise, the [[Prespa Agreement controversy | Prespa Agreement]] faced considerable opposition in both countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>.

### North Macedonia
In North Macedonia, the agreement sparked widespread anger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>. While the main Albanian political parties accepted the deal, the right-wing opposition party, the [[Recent political developments in North Macedonia | VMRO-DPMNE]], rejected it as a fundamental betrayal of the country's identity, driven by outside pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>.

The agreement was put to a public referendum in September 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>. Although it won a majority, the vote failed to meet the required turnout threshold for passage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>. Despite this, it was put to Parliament on January 11, 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>. Amidst accusations of bribery, blackmail, and external pressure, it secured 81 votes in the 120-member assembly, meeting the two-thirds support required for constitutional changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>.

### Greece
Many in Greece also rejected the deal, viewing it as an unacceptable compromise on Greek heritage and identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>. Nevertheless, the agreement passed in the Greek Parliament, securing 153 votes in the 300-member assembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>.

On February 14, 2019, the United Nations announced that it had been officially informed of the name change, formalizing the transition from the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to the Republic of North Macedonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>.

## Aftermath and Current Challenges

While widely hailed as a significant step forward, the agreement produced mixed results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>. It enabled North Macedonia to join NATO, becoming the organization's 30th member on March 27, 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>.

However, hopes that it would fully unlock the country's [[Impact of North Macedonias political changes on EU integration | EU accession]] prospects proved premature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. While Greece dropped its veto over [[Impact of North Macedonias political changes on EU integration | integration]], [[Bulgaria and North Macedonia EU accession dispute | Bulgaria]] now stepped in with its own demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>.

The agreement remained controversial in both countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>. The main Greek opposition party, New Democracy, had opposed the arrangement but adopted a pragmatic position upon returning to power, announcing it would not challenge it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>. This contrasted sharply with the main opposition in North Macedonia, the [[Recent political developments in North Macedonia | VMRO-DPMNE]], which continued to vehemently oppose the agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>.

### Latest Developments (May 2024)
This opposition sparked the latest crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>. On May 8, 2024, North Macedonia held parliamentary and presidential elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>. The [[Recent political developments in North Macedonia | VMRO-DPMNE]] secured a significant victory in both contests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>. The party's candidate, Gordana Siljanovska-Davkova, won the presidency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>.

During her campaign, Siljanovska-Davkova argued that the [[Prespa Agreement controversy | Prespa Agreement]] was contrary to national law and violated citizens' rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>. At her swearing-in ceremony on May 12, she refused to repeat the official oath using "Republic of North Macedonia," instead opting for "Republic of Macedonia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>. This immediately led to the Greek Ambassador's protest departure and a condemnation from the Greek foreign ministry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>. EU officials also emphasized that North Macedonia's progress towards [[Impact of North Macedonias political changes on EU integration | European integration]] depends on adherence to the agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:00">[10:55:00]</a>.

## Future Outlook

While the new [[Recent political developments in North Macedonia | president's]] action was provocative, it appears unlikely that the new government will formally abandon the [[Prespa Agreement controversy | Prespa Agreement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:09:00">[11:09:00]</a>. Such a move would immediately halt any further [[Impact of North Macedonias political changes on EU integration | EU accession]] talks, as both Greece and other EU members would oppose it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:00">[11:28:00]</a>. Given that the [[Recent political developments in North Macedonia | VMRO-DPMNE]] and the new president have stated that [[Impact of North Macedonias political changes on EU integration | EU accession]] remains a core goal, balancing this with abandoning the agreement would be difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>.

Although some in North Macedonia might argue that dim EU accession prospects make abandoning the agreement inconsequential, internal politics may ultimately save the deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:56:00">[11:56:00]</a>. The new government would need support for a constitutional change, which seems unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>. While the government may continue to question the [[Prespa Agreement controversy | Prespa Agreement]] and refer to "the Republic of Macedonia" in some contexts, a formal break is improbable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:19:00">[12:19:00]</a>. However, such actions, even if not a formal break, will inevitably create problems and prompt pushback from Greece and the EU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:00">[12:32:00]</a>. The [[Historical background of North Macedonia and Greece name dispute | Macedonian name issue]] therefore seems to be back on the agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49:00">[12:49:00]</a>.

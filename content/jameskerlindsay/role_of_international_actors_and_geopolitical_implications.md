## International Attention to Conflicts

The level of international attention a conflict receives often depends on various factors. Some situations gain widespread focus due to [[impact_on_international_relations | geopolitical factors]] or the direct involvement of a great power or its close allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Economic effects, such as disruptions to trade routes or access to vital resources, can also draw attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Additionally, if a conflict threatens to spread regionally or internationally, it may receive more focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Media and policy priorities play a significant role, with wars in more remote or less strategically significant areas often receiving less attention, even if their effects are more catastrophic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

Sudan exemplifies a conflict that initially garnered significant media coverage but has since largely disappeared from the news agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Despite escalating into the world's worst humanitarian disaster, international attention remains firmly focused on Gaza and Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Historical [[Role of foreign nations in the conflict | Role of Foreign Nations]]

Sudan's history has been influenced by various foreign powers:
*   **Ancient Egypt** dominated Sudan for thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   The **Ottoman Empire** and its **Egyptian** vassal state expanded their reach into Sudan in the early 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   **Britain** intervened to quell a revolt in 1881, concerned about the Suez Canal and potential wider spread of unrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Britain subsequently established colonial rule, attempting to integrate the northern Arab Muslim provinces with the southern sub-Saharan African tribes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   During decolonization after World War II, Britain quickly decided it could not control the situation, leading to Sudan's independence on January 1, 1956 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **Ethiopia** supported the Southern-led Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) during the second civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
*   The **United States** led peace talks in 2005, which paved the way for southern independence in 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Washington also focused on Omar Al-Bashir, accusing him of supporting Islamist terrorism, following the 9/11 attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   **International pressure** contributed to the Sudanese military agreeing to a power-sharing transitional council after Bashir's ousting in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

## Contemporary Geopolitical Interests and [[Role of foreign nations in the conflict | International Actors]]

The current civil war, which escalated dramatically over the past year, has several [[international_implications_and_geopolitical_interests_in_sudan | international and geopolitical dimensions]]:

### Initial Attention and Evacuations
When the fighting broke out in April 2023, it attracted considerable international attention due to the large number of foreigners caught in the deteriorating situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. This prompted numerous countries, including the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Saudi Arabia, and India, to send military forces for urgent evacuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

### Strategic Importance of Sudan
Beyond the immediate humanitarian concerns, broader political and strategic factors were at play:
*   **Red Sea Position**: Sudan's location on the Red Sea, one of the world's most important waterways, drew attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
*   **Regional Conduit**: Its traditional position as a conduit between North and Sub-Saharan Africa also contributed to its strategic importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

### External Alignment of Factions
The factions in the conflict have sought to build international support:
*   General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the armed forces commander, fostered relations with **Washington and the West** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
*   General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (Hemedti), the RSF commander, established close ties with **Moscow** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. These factional links gave the fighting an international policy and media dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

### Proxy War Dynamics
The conflict has evolved into a "strange proxy war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a> between Russia and Ukraine:
*   Members of the **Russian Wagner Group**, enlisted by Dagalo, are reportedly fighting **Ukrainian commandos** who are supporting the Sudanese Army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

### Impact on Humanitarian Aid
The conflict's wider effects are compounded by external factors:
*   Growing attacks on Red Sea shipping by **Houthi forces in Yemen** have severely curtailed the number of ships reaching Port Sudan, the country's main outlet to the sea, limiting food imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.
*   The wider region has also faced severe famines in recent years, leading to lingering food shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

## [[Role of international community in the conflict resolution | Role of the International Community]] and Attention Deficit
Despite initial efforts to resolve the situation with calls for ceasefires and peace talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>, international media coverage and policy attention soon dwindled, especially after the surge in Middle East violence in October 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

The **United Nations** estimates that half of Sudan's population, approximately 25 million people, require life-saving assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. The UN has called for $4.1 billion US to deal with the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. However, the organization's Under-Secretary-General, Martin Griffiths, noted that it has been "extraordinarily difficult" to get the international community to focus on Sudan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. This lack of sustained international focus means the world is "paying precious little attention to this vast unfolding disaster in Africa" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

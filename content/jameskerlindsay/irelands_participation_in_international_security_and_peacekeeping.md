Throughout its history, Ireland has generally adhered to the principle of neutrality, avoiding military alliances like NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, there are indications this stance is evolving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, especially given growing Russian naval activity near its coast and the changing global security environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Historical Stance and Evolution

Ireland's constitution, established in 1937, emphasized a commitment to cooperation between states and the peaceful settlement of disputes in line with international law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. The formal principle of [[irelands_historical_and_current_stance_on_neutrality | neutrality]] was proclaimed at the start of the Second World War when Ireland refused to join the Allied battle against Nazi Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. Despite this, Ireland leaned towards the Allies, cracking down on anti-British activities, sharing intelligence, and seeing approximately 50,000 Irish citizens join the British armed forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

After World War II and with the onset of the Cold War, Ireland maintained its [[irelands_historical_and_current_stance_on_neutrality | neutrality]], refusing an invitation to join NATO in 1949 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. This was largely due to the unacceptable notion of a formal military alliance with the United Kingdom, which still occupied a part of its constitutionally claimed territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

## Contributions to UN Peacekeeping

Despite its non-alignment, Ireland has built a significant international reputation, particularly as a contributor to UN peacekeeping missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. For over 60 years, the Irish Defence Forces have deployed troops to numerous international hotspots, including the Congo, Cyprus, and Lebanon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

## Post-Cold War Engagement

The context for [[irelands_historical_and_current_stance_on_neutrality | Irish neutrality]] shifted considerably by the 1990s. Relations with the UK improved significantly, especially after Ireland joined the European Communities (now the EU) in 1973 alongside Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. The 1998 Good Friday Agreement further transformed Anglo-Irish relations and opened pathways for eventual [[challenges_and_considerations_for_a_potential_united_ireland | Irish unification]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

In 1999, Ireland joined NATO's Partnership for Peace program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. When the European Union signed the Lisbon Treaty in 2009, which aimed for closer defense and security cooperation among member states, Ireland insisted on a protocol to reaffirm its traditional military [[irelands_historical_and_current_stance_on_neutrality | neutrality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

## Impact of the [[impact_of_the_ukraine_war_on_irelands_foreign_policy | Ukraine War]]

The [[impact_of_the_ukraine_war_on_irelands_foreign_policy | war in Ukraine]] has prompted a significant reassessment of Ireland's security posture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. Ireland has openly and unequivocally supported Ukraine, emphasizing that military [[irelands_historical_and_current_stance_on_neutrality | neutrality]] does not equate to political [[irelands_historical_and_current_stance_on_neutrality | neutrality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

Actions taken by Ireland include:
*   Strongly condemning Russia's invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   Supporting EU sanctions against Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   Supporting the expulsion of Russia from the Council of Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
*   Providing Ukraine with 55 million euros of non-lethal military aid as part of a wider EU contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   Agreeing to train Ukrainian forces in another EU member state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

These actions have pushed the boundaries of what is considered military [[irelands_historical_and_current_stance_on_neutrality | neutrality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

## Evolving Security Considerations

Growing Russian naval activity in Irish waters has highlighted Ireland's increasing strategic significance, especially given that many vital undersea communication cables connecting Ireland to North America pass through its waters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. Concerns about potential attacks on these cables have led the Irish government to consider joining a NATO project to protect this critical infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

The Irish government is exploring options for its defense orientation, with a public consultation underway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. While formal [[debate_on_ireland_joining_nato_amidst_geopolitical_changes | NATO membership]] has not been officially called for, the governing parties have rejected proposals to codify [[irelands_historical_and_current_stance_on_neutrality | neutrality]] into the Constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. The EU affairs minister openly stated that the Russian invasion forced Ireland to reconsider its [[irelands_historical_and_current_stance_on_neutrality | neutrality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

Despite this, some [[arguments_for_and_against_irelands_military_neutrality | arguments for retaining neutrality]] persist, such as its role in national identity and UN peacekeeping efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>, and the potential increase in defense expenditure required for NATO membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. However, critics argue that Ireland's current position benefits from a broader European defense umbrella without contributing financially, akin to "freeloading" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. The government has already announced the largest increase in defense spending in the country's history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

The future of Ireland's involvement in international security and peacekeeping remains a subject of ongoing debate, with options ranging from closer cooperation with NATO to greater integration into EU defense structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.

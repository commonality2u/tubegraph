The Indian state of Manipur experienced widespread violence in early May 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This conflict has resulted in over a hundred deaths and the displacement of tens of thousands of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Although it has received limited international attention, the situation highlights critical questions regarding the management of inter-ethnic relations in India, the world's most populous and diverse country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. The unrest has led to calls for the division of the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

The conflict in Manipur is a pertinent example of internal self-determination, which is the right to a degree of autonomy within existing state borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. While this can involve cultural rights, it often includes territorial arrangements that can themselves become sources of conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Geographic and Demographic Context
Manipur is located in the northeast corner of India, bordering China, Bangladesh, and Burma (Myanmar) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. It is India's 25th largest territorial unit, covering approximately 22,300 square kilometers (8,600 square miles), out of India's 28 federal states and eight union territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Its population is around 3 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

### Key Ethnic Groups
The state is home to several key ethnic groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>:
*   **Meitei:** Primarily inhabit the lowland Manipur Valley, which constitutes about 10 percent of the state's territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. They speak Manipuri, a Sino-Tibetan language, and predominantly follow Hinduism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Hill Tribes:** The remaining 90 percent of the population lives in the mountainous regions surrounding the Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
    *   **Naga:** Located to the north <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
    *   **Kuki:** A central focus of the conflict, residing in the south and central mountainous areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Like the Meitei, they speak languages related to Chinese, Tibetan, and Burmese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. However, most Kuki are Christian or follow local animist religions, unlike the Hindu Meitei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. The Kuki are part of a larger tribal group connected to the Mizo, spanning neighboring Indian states, Bangladesh, and Burma (where they are known as the Chin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

## Historical Context
Manipur has a long and complex history, first mentioned around 1100 years ago as an independent kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

### British Rule and Manipur
The region's modern history is heavily influenced by the growth of British rule in India starting in the 18th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **1762:** Manipur's ruler allied with the British East India Company against Burmese attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   **1826:** This agreement was reconfirmed after Britain's peace treaty with Burma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   **19th Century:** Britain protected Manipur as a minor dependent state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   **1891:** Manipur came under formal Imperial British control following a dynastic dispute, becoming one of about 700 princely states within British India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. At this time, Manipur was already divided into the Meitei-controlled Valley and the hill tribe areas of the Naga and Kuki <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

### Kuki Resistance and British Efforts
Relations between the British and the Kuki were strained even before direct British control of Manipur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. The Kuki opposed colonial encroachment and many Kuki-dominated regions became mutinous after 1891, never fully accepting British rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Early 20th Century:** Britain launched efforts to convert the Kuki to Christianity, achieving some success, but tensions persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   **1917:** The Kuki refused British demands for Indian labor during World War I, leading to an uprising and calls for self-rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. This rebellion was suppressed by 1919 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **Post-WWII:** The Kuki quest for a homeland continued, even as Manipur became a front line in World War II following Japan's invasion of British-ruled Burma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

### Indian Independence and Manipur's Integration
After World War II, Britain decided to grant India independence, resulting in the partition of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   **1947:** The predominantly Hindu areas became the Dominion of India, while Muslim regions formed the Dominion of Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. Princely states had the choice to join either dominion or become independent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
*   **1949:** Manipur initially chose independence but, under pressure from India to unify former British territories, agreed to merge with the Dominion of India on October 15, 1949 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

### Evolution of Manipur's Status within India
*   **Initially:** Under the direct control of the central government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
*   **1956:** Became a union territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **1972 (Jan 21):** Formally became a state of India with complete internal control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

### Tribal Privileges and Growing Tensions
Upon Manipur's integration, the Kuki and other Hill Tribes received special 'scheduled tribe' status under the Indian constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. This granted them preferential treatment in areas like government jobs and restricted non-tribal members from buying land in their areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
*   Despite these protections, many Kuki were dissatisfied, arguing that Manipur's integration was coerced, and sought to create an independent Kuki state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
*   Tensions also grew between the Kuki and the majority Meitei, as well as between the Kuki and Naga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
*   **1980:** The Indian government declared Manipur a "disturbed area," granting the Army significant powers to manage public order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
*   **1980s:** Numerous militant groups emerged, with many coalescing into the Kuki National Organization and its armed wing, the Kuki National Army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   **2008:** Most Kuki groups agreed to a ceasefire with the Manipur State Administration and the Indian national government under the "Suspension of Operations agreement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. This agreement, renewed annually, required militants to withdraw to designated camps where their weapons were secured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

### Calls for Internal Boundary Changes
While the 2008 agreement ended calls for an independent Kuki state, it did not stop demands for changes to internal boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Many Kuki advocated for their areas to be granted new status within India, either as a federal state or a union territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. Proposed territories would encompass most highland areas surrounding the Meitei-dominated Manipur Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. The creation of Telangana as a new Indian federal state in 2014 further fueled these hopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

## The Latest Violence (May 2023)
The current violence in Manipur stems from two primary developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>:
1.  **Non-renewal of Ceasefire:** In March 2023, the Manipur government announced it would not renew the Suspension of Operations agreement, citing reports of Kuki militant unrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.
2.  **Meitei Scheduled Tribe Status:** The Manipur High Court issued a ruling calling for the state administration to petition the Indian government to grant the Meitei "scheduled tribe" status alongside the hill tribes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.
    *   **Kuki Concerns:** Kuki groups feared this would reduce their quota of government jobs and allow Meitei to purchase land in their areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.
    *   **Escalation:** Riots erupted, rapidly escalating into attacks and burning of Kuki and Meitei villages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

Both sides have blamed each other for the violence, and both the Manipur state government and the Indian government have faced accusations of failing to ensure peace and stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. The Indian government asserts it is taking steps to quell the violence, including a high-profile visit by the Indian home minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

### Consequences and Outlook
The violence has led to an exodus of Kuki from Meitei areas, with many fleeing to the main Kuki city of Churachandpur, refugee camps, and neighboring states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
*   **Political Effects:** The collapse of inter-ethnic relations has re-energized calls for a separate Kuki federal state or territorial unit, a view endorsed by all 10 Kuki members of the 60-member Manipur State Legislature, including those from India's ruling BJP party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.
*   **Obstacles to Division:** Manipur's Chief Minister, N. Biren Singh, vehemently opposes any division of the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. The national government also shows no indication of considering a change in status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.
*   **Future Concerns:** There are fears that this rejection could lead to a new cycle of sustained violence and a return to a full-scale armed militant campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. India wishes to avoid this, especially given growing tensions with China and the fallout from Burma's escalating civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. Some suggest that developments in neighboring Burma are driving the violence in Manipur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.

Even if calm is restored and the current constitutional structure is retained, many believe that lasting damage has been done to inter-ethnic relations, strengthening the estrangement between the Kuki and the Meitei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. Manipur, while remaining a single political unit, is likely to remain heavily divided, reflecting much of its modern [[Manipur ethnic conflict|history]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.

The tensions in Manipur are not the only major issues India is facing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. For a broader context of similar situations, see [[Comparisons to other conflicts|comparisons to other conflicts]].

Bosnia and Herzegovina is a country in deep difficulties, remaining deeply divided a quarter-century after a landmark peace agreement ended its brutal war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. It operates with an unwieldy and dysfunctional political system, leading to repeated calls for fundamental changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Demographics and Geographic Overview

Bosnia and Herzegovina is located in Southeast Europe, bordering Croatia, Montenegro, and Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. It covers 51,000 square kilometers and has a population of approximately 3.4 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. The population is divided among three main groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>:
*   **Bosniaks:** Once known as Bosnian Muslims, they constitute around half the country's inhabitants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **Bosnian Serbs:** Around 30% of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Bosnian Croats:** Approximately 15% of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
The remaining 3% includes minority communities such as Albanians, Roma, and Jews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Historical Context of Conflict

The current state of Bosnia and Herzegovina largely stems from the disintegration of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

### Declaration of Independence and War
Following the lead of other federal republics, Bosnia and Herzegovina declared independence in March 1992 and joined the UN months later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This declaration was rejected by the country's Serbs, who, with support from neighboring Serbia, unilaterally broke away to form their own separatist state, Republika Srpska <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. This led to a bitter and brutal three-way war, as Bosnian Croats also declared their independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

### Path to Peace
In early 1994, the first steps towards peace began when Bosnian Croats and Bosnian Muslims (Bosniaks) were persuaded to form a joint entity: the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. This entity is made up of 10 cantons, each with considerable self-government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. The war with the Bosnian Serbs continued until the 1995 massacre of 8,000 Bosniak men and boys around Srebrenica, which prompted the United States and European partners to intervene and organize peace talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

## [[Dayton Accords and Bosnias territorial arrangements | Dayton Accords]] and the Political System

On December 14, 1995, the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, better known as the [[Dayton Accords and Bosnias territorial arrangements | Dayton Accords]], was signed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. This agreement brought the fractured country back together after the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

### Territorial Arrangement
Under the [[Dayton Accords and Bosnias territorial arrangements | Dayton Accords]], Republika Srpska, which comprised 49% of Bosnia's territory, gave up its claim to independence and reintegrated into the state alongside the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. The price of peace was a complex political system built around an "oddly imbalanced territorial arrangement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

### Governance Structure
The agreement stipulated that almost all day-to-day issues would be handled by the entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. The weak central government was limited to a few key areas like foreign policy, immigration, and customs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. The central government's structure reflects the power of the entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>:
*   **Joint Presidency:** Composed of two members (a Bosniak and a Croat) from the Federation and one Serb from Republika Srpska <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   **Council of Ministers:** Also divided on a two-to-one ratio between the Federation and Republika Srpska <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

## Lingering Resentment and Instability

While there were initial signs of reconciliation and reintegration, including the creation of a single military, serious problems emerged after about a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. The political structures, which entrench [[ethnic_diversity_and_tensions_in_bashkortostan | ethnic identity]], came to be seen as discriminatory, and attempts at reform failed, leading to increased dysfunction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

### Perspectives on the System
*   **Bosnian Serb Nationalist Leaders:** Began openly discussing breaking away to form an independent state or uniting with Serbia, both of which are banned under the peace deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. The Bosnian Serb member of the presidency, Milorad Dodik, continuously threatens to hold a vote on secession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Many ordinary Bosnian Serbs recognize that this threat is used for political ends and that secession is unrealistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   **Bosnian Croats:** Started advocating for their own entity, similar to Republika Srpska, a position increasingly supported by neighboring Croatia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   **Bosniaks:** View the problems as a product of excessive decentralization, calling it a "federation within a federation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. They reject calls for a new Croatian entity and many openly advocate for abolishing Republika Srpska <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

### Calls for Abolition of Republika Srpska
For many Bosniaks, and some international observers, the case for abolishing Republika Srpska (RS) is clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. They point to the entity's problematic origins, which many openly call the product of genocide, and the increasingly difficult relationship between RS and the central government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Concerns also exist about the Bosnian Serb leadership being dominated by [[nationalism_and_secessionist_threats_in_bosnia | nationalists]] who reject the existence of the Bosnian state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. There are "worrying signs that Serb [[nationalism_and_secessionist_threats_in_bosnia | nationalism]] is alive and well," including graffiti hero-worshiping wartime leaders convicted of war crimes and a growing denial of atrocities like Srebrenica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. Bosniaks believe RS entrenches the [[nationalism_and_secessionist_threats_in_bosnia | nationalism]] of the past and holds the country back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

Conversely, Bosnian Serbs see Republika Srpska as a legitimate entity underwritten by international treaties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. They argue that Bosniaks are equally imbued with exclusionary [[nationalism_and_secessionist_threats_in_bosnia | nationalism]] and have always sought reasons to abolish RS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. While they identify as Serbs, many consider Bosnia their homeland, not Serbia, acknowledging that joining Serbia would make them a "provincial backwater" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. The veneration of war criminals is seen by many as held onto by a small section of [[nationalism_and_secessionist_threats_in_bosnia | nationalists]], not representing a wider community desire for a return to conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

## The Path Forward: Reform and Compromise

Bosnia and Herzegovina requires reform, as its governance system has been deemed contrary to basic human rights, affecting the lives of ordinary people and preventing EU membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. However, abolishing Republika Srpska is not seen as a feasible solution without a return to conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. There is no international support for such an idea, and foreign diplomats affirm that RS is here to stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

The evolution of RS as an [[nationalism_and_secessionist_threats_in_bosnia | ethno-national]] entity does entrench many of Bosnia's problems, serving as a lightning rod for [[nationalism_and_secessionist_threats_in_bosnia | nationalist]] politicians on all sides, creating a destabilizing vicious circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

For fundamental reform to occur, Bosniaks and Bosnian Serbs must accept two key principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>:
1.  Bosnia and Herzegovina is a single, indivisible state that is here to stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.
2.  Republika Srpska is an entity that makes up that state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

This means Bosnian Serbs need to stop questioning the territorial integrity of the Bosnian state, and Bosniaks need to stop questioning the legitimacy of Republika Srpska <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. Only then might the country achieve a situation where trust can lead to fundamental, compromise-based change, building foundations for a sustainable future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

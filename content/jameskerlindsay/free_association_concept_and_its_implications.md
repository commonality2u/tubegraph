From: [[jameskerlindsay]] <br/> 

Free association is a concept developed to aid decolonisation, offering territories full internal self-government while allowing an outside state to manage aspects of their defence and foreign affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>. This arrangement appears to blur the principles of the modern international system, which is built around the idea of independent [[selfdetermination_and_sovereignty_issues | sovereign]] states with full control over their own affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:47">[00:47:47]</a>.

## Current Examples

Today, there are five examples of free association <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>:
*   The Cook Islands and Niue, associated with New Zealand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>.
*   The Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Palau, associated with the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:25">[01:25:25]</a>.

## The United States and the Freely Associated States (FAS)

The United States entered into Compacts of Free Association (COFA) with the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:25">[01:25:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.

### Geographic and Economic Overview
These three nations stretch across the eastern Pacific, comprising over 2,000 small islands with a combined land area of only 1,350 square kilometres (520 square miles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. Despite their small landmass, their wider maritime boundaries cover approximately 5.6 million square kilometres (2.2 million square miles), giving them the world's seventh-largest exclusive economic zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:09">[02:09:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.

Their combined population is just over 175,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>, with Micronesia having about 113,000, the Marshall Islands 46,000, and Palau 18,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. Their economies are based on subsistence farming, fishing, and tourism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. All three are highly dependent on U.S. aid and grants, which can constitute up to a third of their annual budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

### Historical Context
The islands' history dates back thousands of years, but modern interactions began in the 16th century with Spanish expansion into Southeast Asia and the Pacific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. The Spanish East Indies eventually included the Caroline, Marshall, Palau, and Mariana Islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:08">[03:08:08]</a>. Spain lost the Philippines and Guam to the U.S. in 1898 and sold the remaining territories to Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.

German rule was short-lived, as the League of Nations transferred control to Imperial Japan in December 1920 following World War I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:39">[03:39:39]</a>. U.S. forces seized the islands during World War II, often after brutal fighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:49">[03:49:49]</a>.

After the war, the islands' future was placed before the United Nations Trusteeship Council, which oversaw decolonisation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:02">[04:02:02]</a>. In April 1947, the Security Council designated the U.S. as the administering authority of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:13">[04:13:13]</a>. The Marshall Islands became a centre for U.S. nuclear weapons testing in the late 1940s and 1950s, with 67 tests conducted over 12 years starting in July 1946 on Bikini Atoll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:30">[04:30:30]</a>. This had catastrophic environmental and health impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

As decolonisation progressed, the U.S. faced pressure to relinquish control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. In the 1970s, Washington offered the islands a choice between formal integration or independence under [[internal_versus_external_selfdetermination | free association]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:05">[05:05:05]</a>. In 1975, the Northern Mariana Islands chose to remain tied to the U.S., becoming one of five unincorporated U.S. territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>. The remaining districts opted for free association <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:35">[05:35:35]</a>. Four of them merged to form the Federated States of Micronesia in May 1979, while the Marshall Islands (1979) and Palau (1981) became separate self-governing republics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:40">[05:40:40]</a>.

### Key Provisions of the Compacts of Free Association
By 1984, the U.S. and the islands agreed on the terms of their future relationships under the Compacts of Free Association <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. The key provisions included:
*   The territories would be self-governing states with the right to conduct their own foreign affairs, including signing treaties, in consultation with Washington <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:03">[06:03:03]</a>.
*   Citizens of the FAS would have the right to live and work in the U.S <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:17">[06:17:17]</a>.
*   The United States would assume full authority and responsibility for their security and defence, including the right to block other states from having military access to these countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:22">[06:22:22]</a>. This is known as the "right of strategic denial" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:29">[06:29:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:34">[06:34:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:03">[10:03:03]</a>.
*   The U.S. would provide significant financial assistance for 15 years and allow participation in certain federal economic programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:34">[06:34:34]</a>.
*   The compacts would be subject to regular review and could be terminated by mutual consent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:46">[06:46:46]</a>.

The compacts with the Marshall Islands and Micronesia came into force in 1986 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:54">[06:54:54]</a>. Although the U.S. recognised them as independent states, the Soviet Union initially blocked their formal approval at the UN; they became full UN members in September 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:05">[07:05:05]</a>. Palau's compact was ratified later, and it became a UN member in December 1994 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:27">[07:27:27]</a>.

In 2003 and 2004, Congress extended the financial assistance elements for another 20 years, amounting to an estimated $229 million for Palau, $1 billion for the Marshall Islands, and $2.1 billion for Micronesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:04">[08:04:04]</a>.

## Renegotiation Challenges and Strategic Implications
The financial assistance agreements came up for renegotiation in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:24">[08:24:24]</a>. These discussions have been difficult due to several factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:42">[08:42:42]</a>.

### Issues in Negotiations
*   **Climate Change Assistance**: All three countries seek assistance to manage the effects of climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:52">[08:52:52]</a>.
*   **Nuclear Compensation**: The Marshall Islands is seeking further compensation for the nuclear tests conducted in the 1940s and 1950s, which Washington is resisting, having already paid half a billion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:58">[08:58:58]</a>.

### The Chinese Factor
The primary challenge and importance of the renegotiations stem from the increasing economic, political, and strategic influence of China in the Pacific region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:12">[09:12:12]</a>.

If the talks fail, there are fears that the FAS may engage more actively with China, potentially reducing U.S. influence and leading to a switch in diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to Beijing by the Marshall Islands and Palau <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:30">[09:30:30]</a>. More critically, a failure could lead to the states ending their compacts entirely, which would eliminate Washington's "right of strategic denial" â€“ a potential barrier against Beijing's wider military ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:49">[09:49:49]</a>.

The value of these relationships has been openly recognised in U.S. strategy documents, which call the Freely Associated States "the Bedrock of the U.S role in the Pacific" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:11">[10:11:11]</a>.

### Diplomatic Efforts
Both the U.S. and China have stepped up efforts to win over the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:49">[10:49:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:28">[11:28:28]</a>.
*   In May 2022, Beijing proposed a major new security relationship with 10 Pacific Island States, which was reportedly blocked by Micronesia, calling it "a threat to regional stability" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:55">[10:55:55]</a>. Micronesia recognised the People's Republic of China in 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:12">[11:12:12]</a>.
*   In late September 2022, the U.S. hosted the first-ever Summit with Pacific island leaders, attended by President Biden and Secretary of State Anthony Blinken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:34">[11:34:34]</a>.

Despite these efforts, a final agreement for the compacts was not reached by the end of 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:57">[11:57:57]</a>. The ongoing renegotiations are vital for U.S. national security interests and play a significant role in preserving international peace and stability by countering growing Chinese strategic influence in the Pacific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:10">[12:10:10]</a>.

The [[history_of_the_biafra_war | Biafran War]], also known as the Nigerian Civil War, significantly shaped international thinking on [[secession_and_independence_movements_in_africa | secession and independence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. While the conflict is largely forgotten today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>, its international impact was profound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

## Evolution of Secession Norms
The international community has a deep aversion to [[secession_and_independence_movements_in_africa | secession]], particularly unilateral secession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This contemporary attitude to [[secession_and_independence_movements_in_africa | secession]] largely evolved after 1945 and the founding of the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, with roots in two specific African cases in the 1960s: Katanga's attempt to break away from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the [[biafran_independence_movement | Biafran War]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. While Katanga established the idea of opposing unilateral secession, these ideas were cemented during the [[biafran_independence_movement | Biafran War]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. These two cases underscored the principle that respecting the territorial integrity of states applied not only to external threats but also to internal attempts to secede <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Humanitarian Response
During the late 1960s, the [[the_humanitarian_crisis_during_the_biafran_war | Biafran War]] was widely considered the [[the_humanitarian_crisis_during_the_biafran_war | humanitarian tragedy]] of its era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. An estimated well over a million people died from fighting, famine, and illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Publicly, the [[biafran_independence_movement | Biafran cause]] attracted massive sympathy, especially after images of starving children emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. This led to a major international [[the_humanitarian_crisis_during_the_biafran_war | humanitarian effort]] through the Biafran Airlift, organized by non-governmental organizations and church groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

## Official International Positions

### Recognition of Biafra
At an official level, Biafra received a degree of support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. Five UN members formally recognized it as an independent state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>:
*   Tanzania (April 13, 1968) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>
*   Gabon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>
*   Ivory Coast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>
*   Zambia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>
*   Haiti (the only non-African state) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>

Behind the scenes, Biafra also received military assistance from Spain, Portugal, Rhodesia, South Africa, Israel, and France, who saw a weakened Nigeria as potentially beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

### Support for the Nigerian Government
The vast majority of the international community supported the [[role_of_the_nigerian_government_in_separatist_movements | Nigerian Government]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

#### African States
African states, in particular, viewed the developments in Biafra with grave concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. Many had recently gained independence within colonial borders that encompassed diverse ethnic groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. They perceived [[biafran_independence_movement | Biafra's secession]] as an existential threat to their own territorial integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. The Organization of African Unity (OAU), the forerunner of the African Union, played a key role in rallying regional and international support for Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

#### Key Allies
*   **Britain**: Britain's support for Nigeria was driven by two key factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>:
    *   To prevent the recognition of Rhodesia's 1965 unilateral declaration of independence, Britain could not afford to support another unilateral secession elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
    *   Anticipating Nigeria's victory, Britain sought to protect its significant oil investments in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
*   **Soviet Union**: The USSR saw the war as an opportunity to gain influence over Nigeria, which had previously been a strong opponent of communism in sub-Saharan Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

### Neutrality
The United States maintained neutrality, viewing the [[history_of_the_biafra_war | war]] as an internal affair and not wishing to become embroiled in another conflict while fighting in Vietnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. It officially remained neutral and chose not to supply arms to either side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

## Lasting Impact
Despite some limited support for Biafra, its attempt to break away cemented the international norm against recognizing unilateral [[secession_and_independence_movements_in_africa | secession]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. Before this, the concept of respecting territorial integrity mainly applied to external aggression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. However, the Congo Crisis and then Biafra underscored the emerging idea that states should also respect each other's territorial integrity in the face of internal separatist threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

The [[the_significance_and_impact_of_the_biafran_war | Biafran War]] left a powerful legacy for contemporary rules on [[secession_and_independence_movements_in_africa | secession]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. While public opinion often favored the Igbo people, most countries, especially in Africa, officially or tacitly supported the [[role_of_the_nigerian_government_in_separatist_movements | Nigerian position]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. Facing their own secessionist challenges, these nations saw the conflict as an opportunity to affirm the importance of respecting state territorial integrity against both external and internal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

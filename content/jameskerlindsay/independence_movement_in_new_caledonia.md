In May 2024, widespread rioting erupted in [[recent_unrest_in_new_caledonia | New Caledonia]], a French territory in the Pacific that has long sought independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. French President Emmanuel Macron made an emergency visit to the island as thousands of police reinforcements were dispatched to quell tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. While France views New Caledonia as a strategically vital foothold in the Pacific, there are concerns that the recent violence could signal a return to a more sustained armed campaign to end French rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The clashes raise significant questions about colonisation, self-determination, [[geopolitical_dynamics_involving_new_caledonia | geopolitics]], and hybrid threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## Overview of New Caledonia

New Caledonia is located in the South Pacific, approximately 1,300 km (800 miles) off Australia's east coast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Its closest neighbour is Vanuatu, 630 km (390 miles) to its east <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. The metropolitan power, France, is 17,000 km (roughly 10,500 miles) away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

With an area of around 18,000 square km (7,000 square miles), New Caledonia would rank as the 151st largest member of the United Nations if it were independent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. The population is approximately 290,000, composed of three main groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>:
*   **Kanaks:** Indigenous Melanesians, comprising 40% of inhabitants (2014 census) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Europeans:** Primarily of French origin, making up about 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Other Immigrant Communities:** Including Polynesians, and settlers from Indonesia and Vietnam, accounting for the remaining 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## Colonial History and the Path to Self-Determination

Melanesians arrived in New Caledonia around 5,000 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. The first European visitor was Captain James Cook in 1774, who named it after Scotland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. France formally seized the territory in 1853, initially using it as a prison colony before other settlers arrived towards the end of the century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

With the start of decolonisation after World War II, New Caledonia was placed on the UN's list of non-self-governing territories in 1946, recognising its right to self-determination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. In 1958, New Caledonia was among 20 overseas colonies offered a choice between accepting France's new constitution or gaining independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Along with 18 others, it overwhelmingly voted to remain under French rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. While France granted independence to 14 of these colonies two years later, New Caledonia remained French <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

### Impact of Nickel Discovery and Growing Unrest

The discovery of nickel deposits in the 1960s significantly altered New Caledonia's economic value and population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Increased European immigration and settlers from neighbouring Polynesian states and elsewhere meant the indigenous Kanaks became an increasingly impoverished minority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. This led to the emergence of a pro-independence movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

In 1986, the UN General Assembly reinstated New Caledonia on its list of non-self-governing territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. France held an independence referendum in 1987, but pro-independence forces boycotted it due to a decision to allow newly arrived settlers to participate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. With a 59% turnout, 98% voted to remain part of France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

Tensions escalated, leading to armed clashes between Kanak insurgents and French gendarmes, culminating in a hostage crisis that resulted in nearly 30 deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

### Peace Accords and Planned Referendums

Following the crisis, peace talks led to the **Matignon Agreement** in 1988 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. This deal, confirmed by a referendum, permitted an independence vote for New Caledonia ten years later and committed Paris to economic and social support for the Kanak community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

In 1998, as the deadline approached, a new agreement was reached: the **Noumea Accord** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. This accord outlined a plan for up to three future independence votes to be held between 2018 and 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. It also granted New Caledonia greater autonomy in many policy areas, though justice, public order, defence, foreign affairs, finance, and currency remained under French control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. The accord recognised Kanak identity and created New Caledonian citizenship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. This agreement was also approved by popular vote, with almost three-quarters endorsing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

## Independence Referendums (2018-2021)

### First Referendum (November 4, 2018)

Despite predictions of a heavy defeat for independence, the result was closer than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. While the Kanak community largely favoured statehood, other communities strongly opposed it, fearing the loss of approximately one billion euros annually in French subsidies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. On an 80% turnout, voters rejected statehood by 56% to 44% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

### Second Referendum (October 4, 2020)

Turnout was higher at 86% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. The result again went against independence, but the margin was tighter: 53% to 47% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

### Third Referendum (December 11, 2021)

Despite the narrowing gap in previous votes, pro-independence forces boycotted the third and final referendum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. They argued that the COVID-19 pandemic, which disproportionately affected the Kanak community, made a fair campaign impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Paris ordered the referendum to proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. With a 44% turnout, 97% voted against independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. French President Emmanuel Macron welcomed the result, stating that it made France "more beautiful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

## French Stance Post-Referendums

Despite the contested nature of the third referendum and the Noumea Accord's allowance for further consultations, Paris indicated its desire to put the matter to rest for the foreseeable future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. While not ruling out another vote entirely, the French government suggested it would not happen for many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. This decision was influenced by strategic factors, including China's growing influence in the Pacific and the formation of alliances like AUKUS, making New Caledonia a vital asset for maintaining France's independent presence in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. Macron highlighted this during a high-profile visit to New Caledonia in July 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

## May 2024 Unrest

Tensions escalated in May 2024 when French lawmakers passed new legislation extending the voter base in New Caledonia to anyone resident in the territory for at least 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. Pro-independence groups viewed this as a ploy to dilute support for independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

This decision sparked widespread rioting among the Kanaks, resulting in six deaths, many injuries, extensive property damage, looting, and hundreds of arrests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. The mayor of Noumea, the capital, even claimed her city was under siege <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. France responded by dispatching thousands of additional police and banning TikTok, which it accused of being used to incite and coordinate protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

While order has largely been restored, President Macron's emergency visit underscored the political seriousness of what he called an "unprecedented insurrection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. He pledged to maintain 3,000 forces on the island and promised not to rush voter reforms, but stopped short of abandoning them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

## Challenges and Costs

The recent events highlight deep resentment on the island and ongoing Kanak concerns about poverty, inequality, and independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. While a major uprising might seem unlikely given the Kanaks are not a majority and France's significant resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>, maintaining a large security presence will be costly both financially and diplomatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. Any new insurgency would highlight continued French colonial rule, perceived by many as secured through manipulated voter bases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

## External Influence

France has accused Azerbaijan of stirring up the violence in New Caledonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. An organization called the Baku Initiative Group, reportedly with Azerbaijani government support, has been active in supporting French liberation and anti-colonialist movements in retaliation for French support for Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. While Azerbaijan denies the accusation, if true, it would highlight how hybrid strategies can emerge in unexpected ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

In the short term, France has resecured control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. However, the violent clashes have once again raised questions about the longer-term future of this strategically important Pacific territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

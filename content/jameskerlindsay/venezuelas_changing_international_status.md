Over the past 25 years, [[venezuelas_political_history | Venezuela]] has endured severe economic and political turbulence, leading it to become an international pariah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Initially under the leadership of Hugo Chavez and accelerating under [[nicolas_maduros_leadership_and_international_relations | Nicolas Maduro]], whose presidency is widely unrecognized, the country transformed from one of South America's richest and most democratic states into an impoverished, authoritarian, and isolated nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. However, there are sudden signs of a shift, with [[venezuelas_political_history | Venezuela]] seemingly regaining international acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## The Resource Curse and [[venezuelas_political_history | Venezuela]]'s Decline

A significant aspect of modern international politics is the phenomenon known as the "resource curse," where countries with considerable natural wealth, such as oil, gas, and minerals, often experience worse developmental outcomes, including low economic progress and greater political instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. [[venezuelas_political_history | Venezuela]] serves as a prominent example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Despite possessing the world's largest oil deposits, surpassing even Saudi Arabia, it has suffered an economic collapse and descended into what many describe as a dictatorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This decline led to its ostracization by much of the West and many of its neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Recent Shifts in International Acceptance

Despite the dire political and economic situation, changes are underway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. A key indicator was [[nicolas_maduros_leadership_and_international_relations | Nicolas Maduro]]'s attendance at the COP27 environment summit in Egypt in November 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. There, he engaged in a public conversation with French President Macron, who, despite France's previous refusal to recognize [[nicolas_maduros_leadership_and_international_relations | Maduro]], referred to him as president in a notably friendly exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Signs now suggest other countries, including the United States, may also be altering their stance towards [[venezuelas_political_history | Venezuela]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## Geographical and Historical Context

The Bolivarian Republic of [[venezuelas_political_history | Venezuela]] is located in northern South America, bordered by the Caribbean Sea and Atlantic Ocean to the north, [[venezuelan_guyanese_border_dispute | Guyana]] to the east, Brazil to the south, and Colombia to the west <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Covering approximately 920,000 square kilometers (350,000 square miles), it is the 32nd largest UN member, with a population of around 29 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

[[venezuelas_political_history | Venezuela]]'s modern origins trace back to 1499 when Amerigo Vespucci landed there, naming it "Little Venice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. By the mid-16th century, Spain had colonized it, incorporating it first into the Viceroyalty of Peru and later into the Viceroyalty of Granada (alongside present-day Colombia, Panama, and Ecuador) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. It gained a distinct political identity as a captaincy general <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

The movement for independence gained momentum in the early 19th century during the Napoleonic Wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Under Simon Bolivar, the Viceroyalty of Granada became the Republic of Colombia in 1821, from which [[venezuelas_political_history | Venezuela]] and Ecuador later broke away to become independent states less than a decade later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

From its early days as an independent nation, [[venezuelas_political_history | Venezuela]] experienced factionalism and a series of military dictatorships, struggling under poor administration and accumulating debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

## The Impact of Oil Wealth and Political Instability

Everything changed at the turn of the 20th century with the discovery of oil in western [[venezuelas_political_history | Venezuela]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. Over subsequent decades, the country profited immensely from the global demand for fossil fuels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. By the 1950s, [[venezuelas_political_history | Venezuela]] had become the world's largest petroleum exporter and a key supplier to the United States, driving economic development across various sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. In contrast to many of its neighbors, the country also transitioned from military rule to democratic control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

However, serious economic problems emerged in the late 1980s as international oil prices plummeted between 1981 and 1986, leading to a debt crisis, surging inflation, and growing unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. This precipitated political instability, culminating in major riots in Caracas in 1989, resulting in hundreds, if not thousands, of deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

### Hugo Chavez's Era

In 1992, Hugo Chavez, a young left-wing military officer, launched a failed coup against the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. Pardoned a few years later, he founded the Fifth Republic Movement and won the presidential election in 1998 with 56 percent of the vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

Once in power, Chavez initiated a radical agenda of economic, social, and political change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Buoyed by rising oil prices, he increased public spending on healthcare and education, and launched ambitious infrastructure projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. He nationalized parts of the economy and appointed inexperienced political allies to key sectors, including the oil industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. While popular among the poor, this sparked opposition from the middle and wealthy classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

In April 2002, Chavez was briefly ousted by a military coup, but his supporters quickly mobilized, leading to his return to power within 48 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Undeterred, he continued his domestic agenda and gained an increasingly high international profile, advocating for the developing world and openly criticizing the United States, which he accused of being behind the coup attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. As tensions grew between Washington and Moscow, Chavez strengthened [[nicolas_maduros_leadership_and_international_relations | his relations with Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Despite high international oil prices, [[venezuelas_political_history | Venezuela]]'s poorly run oil industry suffered from low investment and poor maintenance, leading to declining production and slowed revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

### [[nicolas_maduros_leadership_and_international_relations | Nicolas Maduro]]'s Presidency and International Isolation

In March 2013, Chavez died and was succeeded by then-Vice President [[nicolas_maduros_leadership_and_international_relations | Nicolas Maduro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. [[nicolas_maduros_leadership_and_international_relations | Maduro]], committed to his predecessor's policies, narrowly won a special presidential election a month later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

The following year, [[venezuelas_political_history | Venezuela]]'s economic difficulties escalated into a full-blown crisis as global oil prices plummeted from nearly $110 a barrel in June 2014 to just $29 by January 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. This had catastrophic effects, collapsing the economy and sharply reducing living standards, forcing hundreds of thousands to leave the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

In response to popular protests, [[nicolas_maduros_leadership_and_international_relations | Maduro]] clamped down on civil liberties and democratic freedoms, introducing rule by decree, imposing media restrictions, and seemingly authorizing lethal force against demonstrators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

International concern grew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Although [[venezuelas_political_history | Venezuela]] remained a major oil supplier to the United States, Washington began imposing sanctions for human rights violations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. The European Union followed suit in November 2017 with targeted sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

The turning point came in May 2018, when [[venezuelas_political_history | Venezuela]] held presidential elections widely condemned as neither free nor fair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. [[nicolas_maduros_leadership_and_international_relations | Maduro]] claimed victory and was sworn in for a second term on January 10, 2019, but the result was widely rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. The opposition-controlled National Assembly dismissed the outcome, naming its president, Juan Guaidó, as interim president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

International opinion was deeply divided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. Countries like Russia, China, Turkey, Iran, Ethiopia, and South Africa accepted [[nicolas_maduros_leadership_and_international_relations | Maduro]] as president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>, while the West (including the United States, European Union, Canada, Australia, and Japan) recognized Guaidó <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Many South American states, such as Brazil, Colombia, and Peru, also recognized Guaidó <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. With widespread protests and over a million Venezuelans fleeing the economic collapse, the matter reached the UN Security Council, but no action was taken due to divisions among permanent members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. Many countries, particularly the United States, openly began calling [[nicolas_maduros_leadership_and_international_relations | Maduro]] a dictator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

## Reasons for the Shift in International Status

The meeting between Macron and [[nicolas_maduros_leadership_and_international_relations | Maduro]] is significant because France had previously refused to recognize [[nicolas_maduros_leadership_and_international_relations | Maduro]] and accused him of establishing a dictatorship, marking a major change in approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. This is not an isolated incident; the European Union also shifted its stance, stopping recognition of Guaidó as interim president in January 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. More importantly, Washington is also starting to shift its thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

This apparent change of approach is driven by two distinct factors:

### Political Changes in South America
The election of Gustavo Petro in neighboring Colombia has led to a significant thawing of relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. On November 1, Petro became the first Latin American leader to visit [[nicolas_maduros_leadership_and_international_relations | Maduro]] since the 2019 elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. The rise of the political left elsewhere in the region, particularly with Luis Inácio Lula de Silva winning recent elections in Brazil, suggests that he too may engage with [[nicolas_maduros_leadership_and_international_relations | Maduro]] once in office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

### Pragmatism and Geopolitical Factors
Hopes that [[nicolas_maduros_leadership_and_international_relations | Maduro]] would be quickly forced from power due to the disastrous economic situation have not materialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. While this would typically warrant continued distance from the Venezuelan leader, wider geopolitical factors have altered these calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. [[impact_on_international_relations | Russia's war against Ukraine]] has disrupted energy supplies, necessitating a worldwide search for other oil producers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. [[venezuelas_political_history | Venezuela]], with the world's largest reserves, could no longer be ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

Thus, [[nicolas_maduros_leadership_and_international_relations | Maduro]]'s regime, despite its brutal and authoritarian nature, has benefited from being overshadowed by a "far more dangerous international pariah" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. [[venezuelas_political_history | Venezuela]]'s rehabilitation stems not from overcoming its "resource curse" by re-establishing democracy, but from the fact that the rest of the world remains heavily reliant on fossil fuels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

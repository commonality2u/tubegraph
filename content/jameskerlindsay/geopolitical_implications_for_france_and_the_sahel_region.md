For over a decade, [[frances_military_involvement_in_the_sahel | France]] has been engaged in a challenging mission against [[islamist_insurgency_in_the_sahel_region | Islamist insurgents]] in Africa's Sahel region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This engagement has led to a precarious situation, marked by increasing [[tensions_and_challenges_of_operation_barkhane | tensions]] with local countries and a difficult choice for France regarding its continued presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## The Sahel: Context and Conflict
The Sahel is a semi-arid region in northern Africa, stretching approximately 5,400 kilometres (3,300 miles) from the Atlantic Ocean to the Red Sea, and about 1,000 kilometres (600 miles) wide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. The focus of the conflict is primarily on the central and western parts, encompassing Mauritania, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Chad, with a combined population of around 90 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

Islam, which arrived in the 8th century, profoundly shaped the region's history, becoming the main religion in the Mali Empire by 1300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. The area came under [[french_colonial_legacy_and_its_impact | French rule]] during the late 19th-century 'scramble for Africa' and remained so until 1960, when these five countries, along with nine other French colonies in sub-Saharan Africa, gained independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Despite independence, France maintained close economic, political, and military ties, staging over 60 military operations across the continent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

The current conflict intensified with the rise of [[islamist_insurgency_in_the_sahel_region | Islamist extremism]] in the late 1990s and early 2000s, leading to the emergence of groups like Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and the Movement of Unity and Jihad in Western Africa (MUJAO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### French Military Response
France initiated its first counter-terrorism mission, Operation Sabre, in Burkina Faso in 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. The situation worsened dramatically in 2011 with the Libyan civil war, which flooded northern Mali with arms, strengthening Tuareg separatists and Islamist groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. A military coup in Mali in March 2012 failed to contain the violence, leading Islamist forces to push towards the capital, Bamako <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

In response, France launched Operation Serval on January 11, 2013, following a request from Mali <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. This operation held the ground until a 13,000-strong UN peacekeeping mission, MINUSMA, was deployed in July 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Operation Serval concluded on July 31, 2014, but the Islamist threat persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

The next day, Operation Barkhane commenced, involving 3,000 French troops to work with the security forces of the five Sahel states (G5) against the insurgents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Despite a 2015 peace agreement in Mali, activity intensified in 2016 and 2017 with the emergence of the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara, expanding to Niger and Burkina Faso <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

## Escalating Challenges and Political Strain
By 2020, the situation in the Sahel was dire, with over 10,000 deaths, including more than 50 French soldiers and hundreds from the G5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Additionally, 2 million people were displaced, and 4 million required humanitarian aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. The mission became increasingly expensive, costing France about a billion euros annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

France sought to expand its counter-insurgency efforts by involving European partners, forming Task Force Takuba under Operation Barkhane, which included contributions from Estonia, Sweden, Romania, Italy, Hungary, and the Czech Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. However, the situation continued to deteriorate.

### Political Deterioration and Withdrawals
The French presence faced growing political strain:
*   **Mali Coups** A military coup overthrew the Malian government in August 2020, followed by a "coup within a coup" in May 2021, severely straining relations between Paris and Bamako <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
*   **Popular Opposition** Many Malians accused France of failing to stabilize the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   **Strategic Disagreements** Regional calls for dialogue with insurgents clashed with France's steadfast refusal to negotiate with terrorists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

Amid increasing domestic opposition to the costly mission, French President Emmanuel Macron announced on June 10, 2021, that Operation Barkhane would conclude in early 2022, with France planning to reduce its presence to 2,500-3,000 troops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

This decision prompted an angry response from Mali's military regime, which accused France of abandonment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. Tensions peaked when Mali signed a security agreement with the Wagner Group, a shadowy military organization believed to be linked to the Russian defense ministry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. As French forces withdrew from northern Mali in late 2021, Russian mercenaries moved in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

In early 2022, the situation worsened further with a military coup in Burkina Faso, and Mali's expulsion of Danish troops, casting doubt on international counter-insurgency efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Mali's military rulers were accused by the French foreign minister of being "illegitimate" and "out of control," leading to the expulsion of the French ambassador <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

## Broader [[role_of_international_actors_and_geopolitical_implications | Geopolitical Implications]]

The precarious state of [[frances_military_involvement_in_the_sahel | France's counter-insurgency efforts]] in the Sahel raises significant questions about the mission's viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. As French Defence Minister Florence Parly stated, France cannot remain in Mali "whatever the price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

However, a complete French withdrawal also poses considerable risks:
*   **Undermining UN Mission** It could undermine the UN peacekeeping mission (MINUSMA), which relies on counter-insurgency efforts to create conditions for protecting civilians and extending government control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.
*   **Insurgent Expansion** Allowing insurgents to gain further ground could turn the region into a training ground for radicals who might target Europe, as seen in Afghanistan in the late 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
*   **Regional Destabilization** There are fears that the challenge, currently centered in Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, and Chad, could destabilize other countries like Togo, Senegal, and the Ivory Coast, potentially making much of West Africa highly unstable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
*   **French Prestige** Vacating the area would be a significant blow to France's prestige as an international leader in West Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. However, staying risks further resentment and accusations of neo-colonialism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
*   **Russian Influence** Moscow's growing influence in the region, particularly through the Wagner Group, is a major concern for French and wider Western policymakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

These developments occurred against the backdrop of the French presidential election in April 2022, further complicating the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

## France's Dilemma
[[frances_military_involvement_in_the_sahel | France's efforts]] in the Sahel have encountered deepening problems due to growing [[tensions_and_challenges_of_operation_barkhane | tensions]] and decreasing popular support both at home and in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. Military takeovers in Mali and Burkina Faso highlight local frustration with the perceived failure to address Islamist groups and have undermined efforts to foster democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

Like the United States in Afghanistan, France finds itself in a bind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. If it cannot fully withdraw, France faces a choice: either accept that it is in a seemingly unwinnable war and promote dialogue with the insurgents, or commit to an unending conflict that will increasingly alienate local leaders and populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

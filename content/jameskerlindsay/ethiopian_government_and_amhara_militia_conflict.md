In April 2023, the [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia|Ethiopian government]] launched a military operation to disarm militia forces in Amhara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This action, intended to impose order, ignited a major insurgency in the traditional heartland of the [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia|Ethiopian state]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The conflict transformed into one of [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia|Ethiopia]]'s most pressing security challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

While civil wars often involve a group or region against a central government, they can also stem from power struggles between different peoples and territories within a state, requiring national government intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. In extreme cases, numerous groups may fight each other, creating complex situations that threaten a country's existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. The conflict in [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia|Ethiopia]]'s Amhara region is a prime example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Amhara: Background and Historical Role

Amhara is located in the northwest of the [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia|Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, covering approximately 155,000 square kilometers (60,000 square miles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. It is the country's third-largest regional state after Oromia and the Somali region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Amhara shares an international border with Sudan to its west <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a> and is bounded by other [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia|Ethiopian provinces]] including Afar to its east, Oromia to its south, Benishangul-Gumuz to its southwest, and [[ethiopian_civil_war_in_tigray|Tigray]] to its north <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

With around 30 million people, Amhara is the second most populous region in [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia|Ethiopia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Most inhabitants are ethnic Amhara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, who constitute the second-largest ethnic group in [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia|Ethiopia]] after the Oromo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. They speak a Semitic language and are predominantly Oriental Orthodox Christian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

[[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia|Ethiopia]] emerged as the Kingdom of Axum nearly 2,000 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. The Amhara dominated the state from the creation of the [[historical_context_of_ethiopian_politics|Ethiopian Empire]] (Abyssinia) in the late 13th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. They held crucial positions of power, and their influence spread across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Amharic language and Orthodox Christianity became central to [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia|Ethiopian national identity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

### Decline in Dominance and Rise of Amhara Nationalism

In 1974, Emperor Haile Selassie was overthrown by a left-wing military coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. The new communist regime, known as the Derg, reduced traditional Amhara dominance despite most of its officer corps being Amhara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. This decline was further solidified in 1991 when the Derg was overthrown by a coalition of ethnic militias led by the [[ethiopian_civil_war_in_tigray|Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

To address longstanding grievances of minorities, the new [[ethiopian_civil_war_in_tigray|TPLF]] government reorganized [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia|Ethiopia]] as a federation along ethnic lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. In 1995, [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia|Ethiopia]] was divided into nine regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Crucially, areas traditionally controlled by the Amhara were incorporated into the [[ethiopian_civil_war_in_tigray|Tigray]] region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This [[ethiopian_civil_war_in_tigray|Tigrayan dominance]] in the new federal system and the land transfer fueled Amhara resentment towards the central government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Many Amhara abandoned their traditional support for a unified [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia|Ethiopian national identity]] and turned to Amhara nationalism, arguing for better representation of their interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

Amhara resentment persisted for two decades as Tigrayans, the fourth-largest group, dominated the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Their power weakened after Prime Minister Meles Zenawi died in 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. In 2018, ethnic Oromo Abiy Ahmed Ali became Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. Initially, this seemed positive for the Amhara, as Abiy Ahmed worked with other ethnic groups to reduce [[ethiopian_civil_war_in_tigray|TPLF]] power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

## Role in the Tigray Civil War

In 2020, a dispute over election timing erupted between the federal government and the [[ethiopian_civil_war_in_tigray|TPLF]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. After [[ethiopian_civil_war_in_tigray|TPLF]] forces attacked a federal military base, Abiy Ahmed ordered the [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia|Ethiopian National Defense Forces]] to take control, sparking a brutal two-year civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

The Amhara saw an opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Although the war was primarily between the federal government and [[ethiopian_civil_war_in_tigray|Tigray]], Amhara forces joined the fight, aiming to reclaim territories given to [[ethiopian_civil_war_in_tigray|Tigray]] in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. They seized control of the western part of the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

However, hopes for the territory's return to Amhara were dashed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. When the government defeated the [[ethiopian_civil_war_in_tigray|TPLF]] in November 2022, the peace agreement, mediated by the African Union, called for the withdrawal of non-[[ethiopian_civil_war_in_tigray|Tigrayan forces]] from [[ethiopian_civil_war_in_tigray|Tigray]], including Amhara militias from western [[ethiopian_civil_war_in_tigray|Tigray]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. This perceived betrayal fueled greater discontent among the Amhara, who felt their contributions and historical grievances were ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. As a result, tensions grew between Amhara forces and the central government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

## Deepening Tensions with Oromo

While relations deteriorated between the Amhara and the federal government, problems also deepened between the Amhara and neighboring Oromo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. This was driven by political issues, including suspicions that Abiy Ahmed favored his own ethnic group, and growing distrust between the ruling Prosperity Party's Amhara and Oromo wings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. There were also fears that the Oromo aimed to further undermine Amhara influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>, exemplified by anger when Oromo priests attempted to break away from the [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia|Ethiopian]] Orthodox Church, which uses Amharic as its working language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

Growing confrontations along the Amhara-Oromo boundary, with regional forces fighting for control of several areas, underpinned these tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. While this was a problem before the [[ethiopian_civil_war_in_tigray|Tigray war]], it worsened as both sides gained combat experience and weaponry during their fight with the federal government in the north <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. Additionally, clashes increased between Amhara forces and separatist groups in the Oromia Special Zone, an autonomous area within Amhara established during the 1995 territorial reorganization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

## The Disarmament Operation and the Rise of Fano

Against this backdrop of growing Amhara-Oromo fighting, the [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia|Ethiopian government]] decided to crack down on local militias in Amhara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. On April 9, 2023, federal forces launched an operation to disarm these militias and bring them under national military control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. However, this move quickly met with widespread protests and resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

At the center of the opposition was a group known as Fano <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. Fano emerged as a nationalist movement in 2018 as tensions grew between the Amhara and Oromo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. It played a leading role in the Amhara campaign to seize and hold western [[ethiopian_civil_war_in_tigray|Tigray]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. Fano is not a single organized group but rather a loose affiliation of different organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. Despite lacking a unified command structure, Fano has significant popular support among the Amhara and rapidly recruited new fighters from Amhara security forces who refused to join the national army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. By mid-2023, Fano had captured several major towns and cities, including Gondar and Lalibela <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

## Government Response and Current State

Facing a rapidly deteriorating situation, the government declared a state of emergency on August 4, 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. While the [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia|Ethiopian National Defense Forces]] regained control of many towns and cities, opposition continued to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia|Ethiopian forces]] resorted to increasingly brutal tactics, including artillery bombardment and airstrikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

Although the [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia|Ethiopian government]] eased some restrictions in 2024, including lifting the communications ban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>, efforts to find a political solution have failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. A promised referendum on the territory issue in November 2023 has not been held <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. The lack of a defined Fano leadership has scuppered hopes for peace talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

Violence continues to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Aid organizations note ongoing fighting between the government and militias—with Fano claiming control over parts of Gondar in September 2024—and the growing problem of armed criminal gangs exploiting the region's lawlessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. This contributes to a sense that the situation in Amhara is spiraling out of control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

## Implications for Ethiopia's Future

The current fighting in Amhara is significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. It raises a troubling question about [[potential_consequences_of_conflict_for_ethiopias_future|Ethiopia's future]]: could this conflict ignite a wider civil war, leading to the country's disintegration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>?

There are reasons for concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. The Amhara are the second-largest group in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. A full-scale conflict in the region would have devastating human and political consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. The question arises whether [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia|Ethiopia]] can survive if the ethnic group symbolizing [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia|Ethiopian identity]] is marginalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.

The complex [[ethnic_tensions_and_federalism_in_ethiopia|ethnic tensions]] extend beyond Amhara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia|Ethiopia]] faces a precarious balancing act: maintaining national unity while addressing the competing grievances of various ethnic groups, including Amhara, Tigrayans, Oromo, and the large Somali community in the east, which also has a [[historical_tensions_and_conflicts_between_ethiopia_and_somalia|history of unrest]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

However, predictions of [[potential_consequences_of_conflict_for_ethiopias_future|Ethiopia's imminent collapse]] have been made many times before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>, including during the [[ethiopia_and_tigray_conflict_overview|Tigray conflict]], and yet [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia|Ethiopia]] has survived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. The current crisis in Amhara is part of a larger pattern of [[ethnic_tensions_and_federalism_in_ethiopia|ethnic tensions]] long simmering in [[ethiopian_political_history_and_conflicts|Ethiopian politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. The [[ethnic_tensions_and_federalism_in_ethiopia|ethnic federalism]] introduced in the 1990s, meant to address historical grievances and promote autonomy, has inherently fueled rivalries and conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

Despite [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia|Ethiopia]]'s remarkable resilience, complacency can be dangerous, as things may go too far at some point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. While tempting to view the Amhara conflict as just another dispute, there remains the possibility that it could be the conflict that breaks [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia|Ethiopia]] apart, especially given the fundamental role the Amhara have played in [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia|Ethiopia]]'s development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. For these reasons, addressing the conflict in Amhara is more critical than many outsiders may appreciate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

Balochistan, the largest yet least densely populated of Pakistan's provinces, is home to the Baloch people, who constitute approximately 3.5% of Pakistan's population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Baloch communities also reside in neighboring Iran and Afghanistan, speaking a language closely related to Iranian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. The region's rugged borderland terrain has historically played a role in its dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## A History of Conquest and Colonial Rule

Balochistan boasts a history spanning thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. It has been conquered by various empires, including those of Alexander the Great, the Arabs, the Mongols, and the Persians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

In the mid-19th century, Britain seized the eastern part of the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. While some areas came under direct colonial rule, Britain also co-opted local rulers, establishing semi-autonomous princely states within British India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

## Partition and the Decision to Join Pakistan

British imperial control ended in 1947 with the partition of the subcontinent into Hindu-dominated India and the majority-Muslim Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. The princely states were given the choice to become independent countries or unite with one of the new states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

Most of Balochistan's princely states opted to merge with Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. However, the Khanate of Kalat, the largest territory, initially chose independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Under heavy pressure from Pakistan, its ruler relented, and on March 27, 1948, Kalat joined Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This decision remains a source of resentment for many Baloch to this day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

Seven years later, in 1955, Kalat was officially dissolved, and the various parts of Balochistan were united as a single administrative unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. A further reorganization in 1970 made Balochistan the largest of Pakistan's four top-level provinces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

## Troubled Union and Rising Grievances

From its inception, Balochistan's incorporation into Pakistan was marked by unrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Baloch militants launched an armed uprising in 1948, rejecting what they perceived as forced incorporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. Several more significant rebellions followed in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

Although the situation seemed to calm by the 1980s, underlying tensions persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. Beyond political resentment, social and economic discontent grew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. Despite possessing considerable resources, including gold, copper, coal, and oil, Balochistan was largely ignored by the central government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. The province suffered from chronic poverty and neglect, lagging far behind the rest of the country in almost every socioeconomic measure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

Adding to the complexities, the demographic balance began to shift as ethnic [[role_of_pashtun_communities_in_pakistan_afghanistan_conflict | Pashtun communities]] moved into the province <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

## Resurgence of Insurgency

After two decades of relative peace, fighting erupted again in 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. The US-led invasion of neighboring Afghanistan spurred cross-border resistance, leading to an increased presence of Pakistani troops in Balochistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. This surge in troop numbers intensified local resentment, sparking a new rebellion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

In response, the government launched a major crackdown, imposing harsh measures and mass arrests over the following decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Reports emerged of systematic torture and the disappearance of thousands of detainees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

Despite these efforts, the [[baloch_insurgency_in_pakistan | Baloch insurgency]] has continued for the past two decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. The most serious and well-organized group is the [[balochistan_liberation_army_and_recent_attacks | Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA)]], which has been designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, Britain, the European Union, Iran, and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. This ongoing insurgency continues to be a significant challenge to Pakistan's internal stability and its foreign relations, having [[domestic_and_international_implications_of_the_baloch_insurgency | significant domestic and foreign policy implications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

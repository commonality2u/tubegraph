The ongoing conflict in Gaza has led to an increased threat to ships navigating the Red Sea, a vital global shipping lane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Attacks originating from [[yemen_civil_war_and_its_impact_on_regional_stability | Yemen]] have caused many companies to suspend traffic through the area, significantly disrupting global trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This situation has prompted a multinational naval task force led by the United States to address the issue, but there are concerns that such interventions could destabilize the wider Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Strategic Importance of the Red Sea

The Red Sea is one of the world's busiest shipping lanes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Yemen's location at the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula, where the Red Sea (flowing from the Suez Canal) meets the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean, makes it one of the most strategically important locations globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

It is estimated that roughly 30% of the world's container traffic, equating to about 12% of global trade, utilizes this waterway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:03">[02:03:03]</a>. In 2023 alone, approximately 24,000 ships passed through the Bab El Mandeb (Strait of Tears), the narrow passage separating Yemen from Djibouti and Eritrea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.

## Houthi Attacks and Motivations

The [[yemen_civil_war_and_its_impact_on_regional_stability | Yemen civil war]], ongoing for nearly a decade, has primarily been a threat to regional stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>. However, since the start of the conflict in Gaza, the Houthi Movement, a leading rebel group in Yemen, has gained worldwide prominence by attacking ships in the Red Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. The Houthi Movement, also known as Ansar Allah, was created to protect the interests of Yemen's Shia Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:07">[07:57:07]</a>. The group is supported by Iran, which aligns with its broader efforts to destabilize the Gulf region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:03">[08:01:03]</a>.

Following the Israeli attack against Hamas, the Houthis declared they would target any ships bound for Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:05">[11:35:05]</a>. This has led to several major incidents, including the hijacking of a British-registered vessel in November 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>, and numerous drone and missile strikes against shipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:07">[11:53:07]</a>. While many attacks have been thwarted by US, French, and British warships, some have successfully hit their targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:08">[11:58:08]</a>.

## Economic and Shipping Impacts

The rising danger and increased insurance costs associated with transit through the Red Sea have prompted major shipping companies to suspend operations in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:07">[12:05:07]</a>. Companies like the Danish giant Maersk and the Swiss-owned Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC), the world's largest container shipping firm, have halted their services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:00]</a>. BP, a major oil company, has also suspended its tanker fleet operations in the area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>.

This interruption to such a crucial trade route could have significant [[economic_and_political_consequences_of_conflict | economic consequences]] for the international economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:00">[12:27:00]</a>, particularly as many countries are still working to control inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:00">[12:36:00]</a>.

## International Responses and Risks

In response to the threat to global trade, the United States announced the creation of Operation Prosperity Guardian on December 18, 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[12:41:00]</a>. This new naval task force comprises ten countries, including the United States, Britain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Canada, Norway, Spain, the Seychelles, and Bahrain, with the aim of protecting shipping in the Red Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>. Notably, it does not include any other Red Sea states or Arab states beyond Bahrain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>.

However, the response faces significant challenges and risks:
*   **Regional Instability**: There are concerns that the mission, if not handled carefully, could further destabilize the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:20:00">[13:20:00]</a>.
*   **Peace Talks Undermined**: Saudi Arabia and the UAE have opted not to participate in the mission, largely due to ongoing peace talks aimed at de-escalating the [[yemen_civil_war_and_its_impact_on_regional_stability | Yemen conflict]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:28:00">[13:28:00]</a>.
*   **Reigniting Conflict**: Direct strikes against the Houthis could upset the delicate situation on the ground in Yemen and lead to an escalation of fighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:00">[13:40:00]</a>.
*   **Iranian Retaliation**: Any direct US attack on the Houthis could provoke retaliation from Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:00">[13:53:00]</a>. Iran's Defence Minister has already warned that the US-led task force will face "extraordinary problems," asserting Iran's regional dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01:00">[14:01:00]</a>.

The United States acknowledges the delicate balance between ensuring maritime safety and avoiding further destabilization in Yemen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">[14:17:00]</a>. For now, the approach involves shooting down drones and missiles but refraining from direct attacks on the Houthis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:27:00">[14:27:00]</a>. However, if the situation escalates or the broader [[economic_and_political_consequences_of_conflict | economic effects]] become more pronounced, calls for more direct action could emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:00">[14:41:00]</a>. This could potentially plunge Yemen back into its brutal civil war and reignite [[tensions_and_potential_conflict_in_the_horn_of_africa | tensions]] between Saudi Arabia and Iran, with significant [[impact_on_international_relations | international implications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:51:00">[14:51:00]</a>.

For the past decade, [[frances_military_involvement_in_the_sahel | France]] has been engaged in a challenging mission against [[islamist_insurgency_in_the_sahel_region | islamist insurgents]] in the Sahel region of Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This effort, particularly through Operation Barkhane, has faced increasing difficulties as tensions with regional countries have escalated, leaving France in a precarious position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The conflict appears unwinnable by military means, yet a complete withdrawal presents its own set of problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Background of French Military Involvement in the Sahel

The campaign against [[islamist_insurgency_in_the_sahel_region | islamist extremism]] has been a significant international security issue for over two decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. While much attention has focused on US-led efforts in the Middle East and Afghanistan, France has been a key actor in addressing growing radicalism in Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

The Sahel is a semi-arid region in northern Africa, stretching approximately 5,400 kilometres from the Atlantic Ocean to the Red Sea, covering about 3 million square kilometres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. The focus for French operations has been on the central and western parts, including Mauritania, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Chad, with a combined population of around 90 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Islam has been the dominant religion since the 1300s, and most of the population in these five countries are Sunni Muslim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

During the late 19th-century 'scramble for Africa', the area came under French rule until 1960, when the five countries gained independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. France maintained close economic, political, and military ties with its former colonies, conducting over 60 military operations across the continent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. In the Sahel, France established a permanent military presence in Chad in 1986 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

The rise of [[islamist_insurgency_in_the_sahel_region | Islamist extremism]] in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with groups like Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and the Movement of Unity and Jihad in Western Africa (MUJAO), prompted France to establish its first counter-terrorism mission, Operation Sabre, in Burkina Faso in 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

The situation worsened dramatically in 2011 with the Libyan civil war, which led to a flow of arms into northern Mali, strengthening Tuareg separatists and Islamist groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. A military coup in Mali in March 2012 failed to stem the violence, and Islamist forces pushed towards the capital, Bamako <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. The UN Security Council passed Resolution 2085 in December 2012, authorizing the creation of an African-led International Support Mission (AFISMA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. In response to Mali's request, France launched Operation Serval on January 11, 2013, which held the ground until the 13,000-strong UN peacekeeping mission, MINUSMA, was deployed in July 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Operation Serval ended on July 31, 2014, after initial improvements, including pushing back Islamist groups and holding elections in Mali <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

## Operation Barkhane: Establishment and Growing Challenges

The Islamist threat was far from over, leading to the launch of Operation Barkhane the very next day, on August 1, 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Consisting initially of 3,000 French troops and integrating existing French missions, Operation Barkhane aimed to work with the security forces of the five Sahel states (known as the G5) to counter the [[islamist_insurgency_in_the_sahel_region | Islamist insurgencies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

Despite hopes following a 2015 peace agreement in Mali, activity intensified between 2016 and 2017, driven by the emergence of the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. This expansion extended to Niger and Burkina Faso <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

By 2020, the situation had become increasingly dire:
*   France had increased its troop presence to 4,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   The conflict had resulted in over 10,000 deaths, including over 50 French soldiers and hundreds of G5 troops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   An estimated 2 million people were displaced, and 4 million required humanitarian assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   The mission was costing France approximately one billion euros annually, about three-quarters of its overseas military spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

Against this backdrop, France sought to expand its counter-insurgency efforts by involving other European partners through Task Force Takuba, under the umbrella of Operation Barkhane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. This initiative included contributions from Estonia, Sweden, Romania, Italy, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, among others, to serve alongside Malian and other G5 forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## Political Strain and French Withdrawal

Despite efforts to expand support, the military situation continued to deteriorate, and the French presence in the Sahel came under increasing political strain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

Key political developments include:
*   **Military Coups in Mali**: A military coup overthrew the Malian government in August 2020, followed by a second "coup within a coup" in May 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. These coups, strongly condemned by France and ECOWAS, severely strained relations between Paris and Bamako <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
*   **Popular Opposition**: Growing opposition from ordinary Malians accused France of failing to secure the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   **Strategic Differences**: Calls for dialogue with insurgents from within the region contrasted sharply with France's steadfast refusal to negotiate with terrorists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

Amidst these challenges and increasing domestic French opposition to the costly mission, President Emmanuel Macron announced on June 10, 2021, that Operation Barkhane would conclude in early 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. Weeks later, France declared plans to reduce its troop presence to 2,500-3,000, while remaining committed to counter-terrorism efforts, including Task Force Takuba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

This decision provoked an angry response from Mali's military regime, which accused France of abandoning the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. Tensions peaked when Mali signed a security agreement with the Wagner Group, a private military organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. As French forces pulled out of northern Mali bases at the end of 2021, Russian mercenaries moved in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

### Further Deterioration in 2022

The situation further deteriorated in 2022:
*   Mali's military regime continued to defy calls for elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   A military coup overthrew the government in Burkina Faso <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
*   Mali ordered over 100 Danish troops to leave, casting doubt on broader international counter-insurgency efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   The French foreign minister accused Mali's military rulers of being "illegitimate" and "out of control," leading to the expulsion of the French ambassador <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

## The French Dilemma: To Stay or to Leave?

As it stands, [[frances_military_involvement_in_the_sahel | France's counter-insurgency efforts in the Sahel]] are precarious, with a catastrophic breakdown in relations between Paris and local leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. French Defence Minister Florence Parly stated that while they operate at the demand of a sovereign state to combat terrorism, "we can't remain in Mali whatever the price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

However, France cannot simply leave for several reasons:
*   **Undermining UN Peacekeeping**: A withdrawal could undermine the ongoing UN peacekeeping mission (MINUSMA), which is limited in its use of force and relies on counter-insurgency efforts to create conditions for protecting civilians and extending government control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.
*   **Wider Instability**: Allowing insurgents to gain further ground could lead to areas becoming training facilities for radicals who might target Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. A strengthened foothold might also destabilize other countries like Togo, Senegal, and the Ivory Coast, potentially making much of West Africa highly unstable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
*   **[[historical_and_political_context_of_france_in_west_africa | French Influence]] and Prestige**: Vacating the area would be a significant blow to France's prestige as an international leader in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Yet, staying under current circumstances risks further resentment and accusations of neo-colonialism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
*   **[[geopolitical_implications_for_france_and_the_sahel_region | Geopolitical Dimension]]**: Moscow's growing influence in the region is a concern for French and Western policymakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

The situation is further complicated by the backdrop of the French presidential election in April 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. Observers suggest that, like the United States in Afghanistan, France may be caught in an intractable bind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. The choice now is between accepting an seemingly unwinnable war and promoting dialogue with insurgents, or committing to a never-ending conflict that will increasingly pit France against local leaders and populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

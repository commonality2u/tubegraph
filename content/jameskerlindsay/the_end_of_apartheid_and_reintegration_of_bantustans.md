During the [[apartheid_and_the_creation_of_bantustans_in_south_africa | apartheid]] era, South Africa established four nominally independent states, known as Bantustans or homelands, designed to perpetuate [[racial_segregation_policies_during_apartheid | racial segregation]] and white minority rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These entities were never recognized by the [[international_recognition_and_sovereignty_of_bantustans | International Community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## The Crumbling of Apartheid

The system of [[apartheid_and_the_creation_of_bantustans_in_south_africa | apartheid]] faced decades of [[international_condemnation_of_apartheid_policies | international pressure]] and an increasingly tight sanctions regime, which eventually led to its collapse towards the end of the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

## Demise of Bantustans in Southwest Africa

In 1990, the 10 self-governing Bantustans in Southwest Africa disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. This occurred when South Africa withdrew from the territory, leading to Namibia becoming an independent member of the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

## South Africa's Transition to a Post-Apartheid Era

Following these developments, South Africa moved towards a post-[[apartheid_and_the_creation_of_bantustans_in_south_africa | apartheid]] era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. Multi-party talks culminated in an agreement on an interim constitution for a multi-racial democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. The UN General Assembly called upon the new South African government to ensure the peaceful reincorporation of the homelands back into the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

## Reincorporation Process

Over the subsequent months, South Africa prepared to take over the Bantustans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

### Initial Acceptance and Resistance
While Transkei and Venda, both under military rule, accepted the decision to be reincorporated, Ciskei and Bophutatswana initially resisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

### The Bophutatswana Crisis
Resistance led to a crisis in Bophutatswana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. Its president, Lucas Mangope, faced a strike by civil servants who supported reintegration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. He sought assistance from Afrikaaner nationalists, but this led to violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. The military mutinied, and Mangope fled on March 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. The next day, the South African government formally appointed an interim administrator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>, at which point Ciskei also accepted reincorporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

## Repealing Bantustan Legislation

On April 27, 1994, the first day of the interim constitution, the South African Parliament repealed the legislation that had created the Bantustans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. This included not only the four nominally independent ones (Transkei, Bophutatswana, Venda, and Ciskei), but also the six others that operated under South African rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. The new constitutional order ensured that all parts of the country would become a united state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

## Significance of Bantustan Reintegration

The Bantustans represent a unique case in [[secession_and_independence_ आंदोलनों_in_africa | international relations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. Although states generally have the right to determine their borders and allow parts of their territory to become independent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>, the international community rejected the independence of the Bantustans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. This rejection stemmed from the view that their independence was a cynical move to support a racist system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

The condemnation was not based on their capacity to function as states, but rather because they were deliberately designed to undermine the human rights and self-determination of the majority Black population of South Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. Their existence was meant to support the racist policy of [[apartheid_and_the_creation_of_bantustans_in_south_africa | Apartheid]], which was deemed a crime against humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. Thus, the four so-called independent Bantustans stand as a unique anomaly, being the only example of a country granting independence to its territory that was subsequently rejected by the wider international community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

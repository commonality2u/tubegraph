Slovakia's foreign policy has recently drawn international attention due to a shift in its stance towards the conflict in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. In late 2023, Slovak voters elected a new government led by former Prime Minister Robert Fico, who is widely regarded as pro-Russian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This has led to questions about whether Slovakia is undermining Western solidarity or is still considered one of NATO's "weak links" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Historical Context

Slovakia, a landlocked state in Central Europe, shares a 100-kilometer (60-mile) border with Ukraine to its east <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:01">[02:23:01]</a>. Its population is approximately 5.4 million, with ethnic Slovaks comprising about 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:09">[02:28:09]</a>.

The nation's roots trace back to Slavic tribes settling in Central Europe in the fifth and sixth centuries, eventually forming the Great Moravian Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:03">[02:39:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:07">[02:45:07]</a>. After the empire's collapse in the early 10th century, the region fell under the Kingdom of Hungary, which later became part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until its collapse in 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:02">[02:51:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.

Following World War I, the Czechs and Slovaks formed the independent state of Czechoslovakia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. Despite being economically prosperous, internal tensions arose due to Slovakia being the less developed and less populous junior partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:08">[03:16:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:07">[03:27:07]</a>. Czechoslovakia collapsed in March 1939, with Slovakia becoming an ultra-nationalist Nazi puppet state under Jozef Tiso during World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:07">[03:45:07]</a>.

Reestablished after the war, Czechoslovakia fell under communist control and became part of the Soviet-dominated Warsaw Pact during the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:06">[04:01:06]</a>. This period ended with a peaceful revolution in 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:05">[04:06:05]</a>. In 1992, the Czech and Slovak leaders agreed to the "Velvet Divorce," leading to Slovakia's emergence as an independent state on January 1, 1993 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:01">[04:20:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:02">[04:26:02]</a>.

Initially, Slovakia pursued a different political and economic path, struggling with European integration under the nationalist, authoritarian rule of Vladimir Mečiar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:04">[04:41:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:06">[04:53:06]</a>. However, a new centre-right government under Prime Minister Mikuláš Dzurinda took power in 1998, committed to European integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:02">[05:10:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:02">[05:14:02]</a>. Slovakia subsequently joined NATO and the European Union in 2004 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:09">[05:17:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:04">[05:22:04]</a>.

## Robert Fico's Previous Tenures and Foreign Policy Shifts

In 2006, Robert Fico became prime minister, leading a populist left-wing nationalist government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:05">[05:37:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:08">[05:43:08]</a>. His Smer-SD party focused on social welfare and public spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:01">[05:56:01]</a>. Foreign policy under Fico saw several points of departure from most EU and NATO partners:
*   **Kosovo** Slovakia refused to recognize Kosovo's 2008 Declaration of Independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:07">[06:05:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:02">[06:15:02]</a>.
*   **Migrant Crisis (2015)** Slovakia joined Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic (the Visegrád Four) in rejecting calls to take in refugees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:09">[06:20:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:05">[06:35:05]</a>.
*   **Crimea Annexation (2014)** When Russia annexed Crimea, Fico initially opposed EU sanctions on Moscow, arguing for maintaining economic links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:07">[06:40:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>. He also highlighted Slovakia's dependence on Russian energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:08">[06:59:08]</a>. Despite these concerns, Slovakia eventually aligned with EU and NATO policies, condemning Russia's actions, endorsing Ukraine's territorial integrity, introducing sanctions, and reducing its reliance on Russian energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:03">[07:08:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:08">[07:24:08]</a>.

Fico's tenure ended in 2018 amid accusations of authoritarianism and state corruption, triggered by the murder of a journalist investigating links between politicians and organized crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:07">[07:41:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>. He was forced to resign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:05">[07:57:05]</a>.

## Interim Period and Pro-Western Alignment (2018-2023)

Following Fico's resignation, Slovakia seemed to move in a new direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>. A new right-wing coalition government came to power in 2020, vowing to fight corruption and implement reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:07">[08:09:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:04">[08:14:04]</a>. After Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, this government fully aligned with its EU and NATO partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:07">[08:19:07]</a>. Slovakia condemned the Russian attack, imposed sanctions on Moscow, took in over 100,000 Ukrainian refugees, and provided Ukraine with weapons, including fighter jets and anti-aircraft missile systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:02">[08:31:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:08">[08:41:08]</a>.

## Robert Fico's Return to Power (Late 2023)

Despite Slovakia's alignment with Western partners, public sentiment within the country began to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:09">[08:49:09]</a>. There was growing disillusionment with the government and increasing public skepticism about the war in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>. Polling showed that less than half the population supported sanctions against Moscow or economic and military aid to Ukraine, as many Slovaks still viewed Russia as a "brotherly nation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:09">[09:11:09]</a>.

Capitalizing on this sentiment, Robert Fico successfully campaigned for re-election in September 2023 with an overtly pro-Russian position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:04">[09:33:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:07">[09:39:07]</a>. He argued that sanctions were harming the Slovak economy and promised to oppose further economic measures against Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:03">[09:44:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:09">[09:49:09]</a>. Fico also pledged to stop all state-provided armed supplies to Ukraine, insisting Slovakia would not send "another bullet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:02">[09:54:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:08">[09:58:08]</a>.

After his election victory, Fico's new coalition government swiftly announced the end of all military aid to Ukraine within weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:04">[10:22:04]</a>. He continued to express controversial views, calling Ukraine corrupt and under US domination, and suggesting it would have to accept territorial loss for peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:09">[10:27:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:05">[10:37:05]</a>. Fico also reiterated his opposition to Ukrainian NATO membership, calling it a basis for a third world war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:08">[10:40:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:07">[10:45:07]</a>. His foreign minister met with Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov in Turkey, causing "considerable anger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:07">[10:49:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:07">[10:54:07]</a>. Furthermore, Fico has been building ties with [[Hungarys relations with Russia and Ukraine | Hungary's Viktor Orbán]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:08">[10:57:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:00">[11:04:00]</a>.

## Nuances and Mixed Messaging

Despite his strong rhetoric, Fico has also been careful not to completely sever relations with Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:00">[11:04:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:04">[11:11:04]</a>. In January 2024, he assured his Ukrainian counterpart that Slovakia would support Ukraine's EU accession and would not block a large EU aid package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:04">[11:11:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:00">[11:22:00]</a>. A subsequent meeting in April saw Fico announce increased business ties, strengthened transport links, and a corridor for Ukrainian agricultural goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:00">[11:22:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:00">[11:35:00]</a>.

While cutting state military aid, Fico clarified he would not object to private support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:00">[11:35:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:03">[11:40:03]</a>. This led to an "extraordinary development" where thousands of Slovaks, opposing the government's stance, joined a crowdfunding campaign to support a Czech initiative to purchase ammunition for Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44:00">[11:44:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>.

## Interpretations and Impact

The reasoning behind Fico's mixed messaging remains unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>. Theories include:
*   Reflecting close trading links between Ukraine and Slovakia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:00">[12:03:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>.
*   Fico observing the direction of the Ukraine war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13:00]</a>.
*   A calculated move to avoid completely breaking ties with EU and NATO partners, unlike [[Hungarys relations with Russia and Ukraine | Hungary's Viktor Orbán]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:00">[12:27:00]</a>.
*   Fico potentially not being as pro-Russian as he appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:00">[12:27:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:00">[12:32:00]</a>.

Regardless of Fico's true position, his words and actions have created uncertainty about Slovakia's goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:00">[12:32:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[12:41:00]</a>. This has undermined broader US and EU trust in Slovakia's reliability as an ally, fostering the impression that Slovakia is "another weak link in the broader Western front against Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[12:41:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:08">[12:53:08]</a>.

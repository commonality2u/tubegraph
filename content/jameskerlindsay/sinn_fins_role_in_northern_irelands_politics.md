Sinn Féin is a political party dedicated to [[challenges_and_considerations_for_a_potential_united_ireland | Irish unification]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Historically, the party has been widely understood to have been closely aligned with the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), seen as its political wing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

## Political Emergence and Electoral Success

In May 2022, Sinn Féin marked a "political earthquake" in Ireland when elections in the north saw them emerge as the largest single political force in the province, a century after the island was partitioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This victory was graphically highlighted as they won 27 of the 90 seats in the Northern Irish Assembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Sinn Féin was already the second largest party in the Irish Republic and the strongest voice for [[challenges_and_considerations_for_a_potential_united_ireland | Irish reunification]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

The symbolic significance of a nationalist party, especially one closely aligned with the IRA, winning the election in what was designed as a Protestant Unionist homeland, is considerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. However, it's important to note that Sinn Féin's victory stemmed from the main Unionist party losing seats, rather than Sinn Féin gaining a significant number of new seats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

## Role in Government and the Peace Process

Following the Belfast Agreement (Good Friday Agreement) in 1998, a system was introduced guaranteeing all major political parties, including Sinn Féin, a place in government in Northern Ireland's self-rule administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

## Stance on Irish Unification

Sinn Féin's primary political objective is a [[challenges_and_considerations_for_a_potential_united_ireland | united Ireland]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The party's leader, Mary Lou McDonald, has expressed a desire to see a referendum on [[challenges_and_considerations_for_a_potential_united_ireland | Irish unification]] (a border poll) within the next five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

Despite this ambition, Sinn Féin's leader in the North, Michelle O'Neill, who could become First Minister, has indicated that the key focus at this stage is on addressing day-to-day issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. The party's current goal seems to be winning people over to the idea of unity, including Catholics who may have reservations about [[challenges_and_considerations_for_a_potential_united_ireland | unification]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

While Sinn Féin's victory in May 2022 was highly symbolic, the immediate prospect of [[challenges_and_considerations_for_a_potential_united_ireland | Irish unification]] remains uncertain, with significant hurdles to overcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. However, the trajectory suggests that a [[challenges_and_considerations_for_a_potential_united_ireland | united Ireland]] by the end of the decade is now "certainly conceivable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

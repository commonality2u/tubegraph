Slovakia's position within [[nato_and_eastern_europe_security | NATO]] and the [[european_union_and_nato_aspirations_versus_prorussian_sentiment | European Union]] has faced scrutiny, particularly in late 2023 following the election of a new government widely regarded as pro-Russian [00:00:03]. This shift has raised questions about whether Slovakia is undermining Western solidarity against Russia [00:00:00], potentially serving as one of [[nato_and_eastern_europe_security | NATO]]'s "weak links" [00:00:30].

## Historical Context and Integration

Slovakia is a landlocked state in Central Europe, covering approximately 49,000 square kilometers (19,000 square miles), sharing a 100-kilometer (60-mile) border with Ukraine to its east [00:02:07]. Its population is around 5.4 million, with 80% being ethnic Slovaks [00:02:28].

Historically, the area was settled by Slavic tribes in the fifth and sixth centuries, forming the Great Moravian Empire [00:02:39]. After its collapse, it fell under the Kingdom of [[comparative_analysis_of_hungary_and_other_eu_and_nato_member_states | Hungary]], eventually becoming part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until 1918 [00:02:51]. Post-World War I, the northern Slavic populations formed Czechoslovakia [00:03:03]. Despite Czechoslovakia's economic prosperity and democracy in Eastern Europe, internal tensions arose, with Slovakia as the "junior partner" [00:03:16]. In March 1939, Slovakia became an ultra-nationalist Nazi puppet state under Jozef Tiso following Hitler's annexation of western Czechoslovakia [00:03:32].

Czechoslovakia was reestablished after the war but fell under communist control, becoming part of the Soviet-dominated Warsaw Pact until 1989 [00:03:51]. A peaceful revolution in 1989 ended communist rule, leading to increased pressure for Slovak autonomy [00:04:06]. In 1992, Czech and Slovak leaders agreed to the "Velvet Divorce," resulting in two separate independent states on January 1, 1993 [00:04:20].

Initially, Slovakia took a different political and economic path from the Czech Republic, hindering its European integration under the nationalist, authoritarian rule of Vladimir Mečiar [00:04:34]. Concerns about corruption, press freedom, and judicial independence made it "the most problematic" of the former Soviet satellite states [00:04:58]. This changed in 1998 with the centre-right government of Prime Minister Mikuláš Dzurinda, who was committed to European integration [00:05:10]. As a result, Slovakia joined [[nato_and_eastern_europe_security | NATO]] in 2004 and the [[european_union_and_nato_aspirations_versus_prorussian_sentiment | European Union]] alongside nine other countries, including the Czech Republic [00:05:17].

## Robert Fico's Prior Leadership and Shifting Foreign Policy

In 2006, the centre-right administration was replaced by a populist left-wing nationalist government led by Robert Fico [00:05:32]. His Smer-SD party focused on social welfare and public spending after the previous government's economic liberalization efforts [00:05:48].

Under Fico, [[public_sentiment_and_foreign_policy_in_slovakia | Slovakia's foreign policy]] saw changes [00:06:02]:
*   **Kosovo**: Slovakia refused to recognize Kosovo's 2008 Declaration of Independence, contrary to most EU and [[nato_and_eastern_europe_security | NATO]] partners [00:06:08].
*   **Migrant Crisis**: In 2015, Slovakia joined [[comparative_analysis_of_hungary_and_other_eu_and_nato_member_states | Hungary]], Poland, and the Czech Republic (the Visegrád Four) in rejecting calls to take in refugees during the migrant crisis [00:06:20].
*   **[[slovakias_relationship_with_russia_and_ukraine | Russia and Ukraine]] (2014)**: When Russia invaded and annexed Crimea in 2014, Fico initially opposed EU sanctions on Moscow, advocating for maintaining economic links due to Slovakia's dependence on Russian energy [00:06:40]. However, Slovakia eventually aligned its policies with the [[european_union_and_nato_aspirations_versus_prorussian_sentiment | European Union]] and [[nato_and_eastern_europe_security | NATO]], condemning Russia, endorsing Ukraine's territorial integrity, introducing sanctions, and reducing energy dependence on Russia [00:07:08]. Slovakia even assisted Ukraine when Russia limited gas supplies [00:07:27].

Fico's tenure ended in 2018 amidst accusations of authoritarianism and state corruption, exacerbated by the murder of a journalist investigating links between politicians and organized crime [00:07:41]. He was forced to resign [00:07:57].

## Period of Western Alignment (2018-2023)

Following Fico's resignation, [[slovakias_shifting_political_landscape | Slovakia appeared to move]] in a new direction [00:08:04]. A young, modernizing president was elected in 2019, and a new right-wing coalition government came to power in 2020, vowing to fight corruption [00:08:09].

In contrast to the earlier Fico administration, this government fully aligned with its EU and [[nato_and_eastern_europe_security | NATO]] partners following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 [00:08:19]. Slovakia condemned the Russian attack, imposed sanctions on Moscow, took in over 100,000 Ukrainian refugees, and provided Ukraine with weapons, including fighter jets and anti-aircraft missile systems [00:08:31].

## Robert Fico's Return and Renewed Pro-Russian Stance (Late 2023 Onwards)

Despite Slovakia's alignment with Western partners, [[public_sentiment_and_foreign_policy_in_slovakia | public mood began to change]] within the country [00:08:45]. There was disillusionment with the government and increasing public skepticism about the war in Ukraine [00:08:52]. Polling indicated that less than half the population supported sanctions against Moscow or economic and military aid to Ukraine, with a majority still viewing Russia as a "brotherly nation" [00:09:02]. The president announced she would not run for a second term due to death threats, highlighting worries about the country's direction [00:09:15].

In September 2023, Fico attempted a political comeback [00:09:26]. Capitalizing on popular sentiment, he adopted an overtly pro-Russian position and challenged Slovakia's Western partners [00:09:39]. He argued that sanctions were harming the Slovak economy and vowed to oppose any further economic measures against Moscow [00:09:44]. He also promised to halt all armed supplies to Ukraine, stating Slovakia would not send "another bullet" [00:09:54].

Against polling predictions, Fico secured a major victory, taking about a quarter of the vote, and returned as prime minister of a new coalition government [00:10:03]. Upon taking office, he immediately ended all state military aid to Ukraine [00:10:16].

Fico continued to court controversy in early 2024, calling Ukraine "corrupt and under US domination" and suggesting it would have to accept territorial losses for peace [00:10:27]. He reiterated his long-standing opposition to Ukraine's [[nato_and_eastern_europe_security | NATO]] membership, arguing it was "the basis for a third world war" [00:10:40]. There was also anger when Slovakia's foreign minister met with Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov in Turkey [00:10:49]. Additionally, Fico has been building ties with [[comparative_analysis_of_hungary_and_other_eu_and_nato_member_states | Hungary's Viktor Orbán]] [00:10:57].

## Mixed Messaging and Uncertainty

Despite his critical stance, Fico has also shown caution not to sever relations with Ukraine entirely [00:11:04]. In January 2024, he assured his Ukrainian counterpart that Slovakia would support Ukraine's [[european_union_and_nato_aspirations_versus_prorussian_sentiment | EU accession]] and would not block a large EU aid package [00:11:11]. Another meeting in April saw Fico announce increased business ties, strengthened transport links, and a corridor for Ukrainian agricultural goods [00:11:22].

While cutting state military aid, Fico clarified he would not object to private support for Ukraine [00:11:35]. This led to thousands of Slovaks, objecting to the government's stance, joining a crowdfunding campaign to support a Czech initiative to purchase ammunition for Ukraine [00:11:44].

The reasons behind this mixed messaging are unclear [00:11:57]. Theories include:
*   Reflecting close trading links between Ukraine and Slovakia [00:12:03].
*   Fico assessing the direction of the Ukraine war [00:12:08].
*   Fico, even if instinctively pro-Russian, understanding that Slovakia cannot sever ties with its EU and [[nato_and_eastern_europe_security | NATO]] partners in the same way [[comparative_analysis_of_hungary_and_other_eu_and_nato_member_states | Hungary]] has [00:12:13].
*   A suggestion that Fico may not be as pro-Russian as he appears [00:12:27].

Regardless of Fico's true position, his words and actions have created uncertainty about Slovakia's aims and objectives, undermining US and EU trust in the country's reliability as an ally [00:12:32]. This has reinforced the impression that Slovakia is indeed "another weak link in the broader Western front against Russia" [00:12:48].

Turkey's foreign relations have undergone significant shifts, moving from a century-long pivot towards Europe and the West to an increasingly strained relationship, marked by growing ties with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## A Century-Long Pivot Towards the West

Following the effective collapse of the Ottoman Empire at the end of the First World War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, the Republic of Turkey was created by Turkish nationalist forces led by Mustafa Kemal (Ataturk) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. The new republic embarked on a path of modernisation and Europeanisation, including pushing Islam out of the public realm and introducing the Latin alphabet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

Turkey solidified its Western orientation by becoming a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the main Western security body, in 1950, and also joined the Council of Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. In 1963, Turkey signed an association agreement with the European Economic Community (EEC), which would eventually become the [[turkeys_relationship_with_european_union_and_membership_aspirations | European Union]], opening the possibility of eventual membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

## Growing Strains and Diplomatic Crises

Despite these initial steps, Turkey's hopes for European integration made little progress in the decades that followed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Concerns arose over military coups questioning its commitment to democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, and tensions grew with fellow EU-member and NATO partner Greece, particularly over Cyprus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. There was also a perception that Turkey, an overwhelmingly Muslim nation despite its secular nature, was being excluded from what was seen as a "Christian club" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. This impression intensified with the EU's decision to open membership to formerly communist countries after the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

Relations between Turkey and the [[turkeys_relationship_with_european_union_and_membership_aspirations | European Union]] became increasingly strained by the late 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. However, following a breakthrough with Greece, Turkey finally became a candidate for EU membership in 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

### Erdogan's Administration and Shifting Outlook

Ironically, it was the election of an overtly religious administration in November 2002, the Justice and Development Party (AKP) led by Recep Tayyip Erdogan, that initially brought new impetus to EU accession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Erdogan viewed EU membership as a means to expand religious freedom and challenge the military's power, leading to political reforms and the formal opening of EU membership discussions in 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

However, Erdogan's political outlook began to change, leading to growing autocratic tendencies, the rollback of human rights reforms, and curtailment of media freedoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. This culminated in a harsh crackdown on massive protests in May 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a> and a major purge of suspected opposition following an attempted coup in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

### The Osman Kavala Case and Diplomatic Fallout

One significant case illustrating these strains is that of Osman Kavala, a Turkish businessman and philanthropist arrested in the purge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Charged with attempting to overthrow the government, he was held in pre-trial detention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. The European Court of Human Rights, the judicial organ of the Council of Europe, unanimously ruled in December 2019 that he had been deprived of his right to liberty and timely justice, ordering his immediate release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

Despite its obligation as a Council of Europe member, Turkey refused to release Kavala <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. This led the Council of Europe to announce in September 2021 that it would begin infringement proceedings against Turkey, potentially leading to suspension or expulsion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

This situation prompted the ambassadors of 10 Western countries, including the United States, France, and Germany, to sign a joint letter in October 2021 calling on the Turkish government to abide by the Court's ruling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. Furious at this move, Erdogan declared the ambassadors "persona non grata," effectively announcing they were no longer welcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. While the [[turkeys_diplomatic_crisis_with_the_west | crisis was quickly defused]] when the involved countries stated adherence to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, the underlying issues remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

## Shifting Alliances: Closer Ties with Russia and Divergence from the West

The incident with the ambassadors further emphasized the expanding rift between Turkey and its Western partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. Beyond domestic issues, concerns have grown regarding Ankara's foreign policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

Most notably, Erdogan has forged a close relationship with Putin's [[turkeys_evolving_foreign_relations_especially_with_russia_and_the_us | Russia]] in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Concurrently, he has increasingly blamed the West for Turkey's problems, using it to deflect from economic difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Europe and the United States are now presented as opponents rather than allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

This shift indicates a growing disregard for the "basic rules of the Western club," as adherence to the European Court of Human Rights' rulings is a fundamental prerequisite for membership in both the Council of Europe and the [[turkeys_relationship_with_european_union_and_membership_aspirations | European Union]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

## The Future of Turkey's Western Ties

The prevailing view among observers is that Turkey has already broken with the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. The decision on a final political separation now largely rests with the [[turkeys_relationship_with_european_union_and_membership_aspirations | European Union]] and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

The debate in the West centers on two main perspectives:

*   **Proponents of a Break:** This view argues that Turkey can no longer be considered an ally or a country sharing fundamental values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. They advocate for stopping EU membership talks, suspending or expelling Turkey from the Council of Europe if it fails to comply with its obligations, and some even suggest expulsion from [[turkeys_relationship_with_nato_and_the_eu | NATO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

*   **Pragmatists:** This perspective argues that while EU accession talks have stalled and membership is unrealistic, a complete break would worsen the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. They fear Ankara would cement its partnership with other "troublesome forces" like [[turkeys_evolving_foreign_relations_especially_with_russia_and_the_us | Russia]] and that it could have negative consequences in the Muslim world, being seen as final proof of Western opposition to Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. They believe it is better to keep Turkey in the "club," even nominally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

*   **Optimists:** While despairing of Turkey under Erdogan, optimists hope for a future return to the European track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. They argue for keeping this possibility alive to encourage pro-Western forces in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. However, even within this group, many question whether Turkey has passed the point of no return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

The prevailing view, despite Turkey's problems, remains that it is better to keep Turkey part of the West, even if only in name, rather than forcing a final split <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. However, this argument becomes harder to sustain with each new crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. The Kavala case is particularly important as it may force a final decision on issues that would fundamentally affect Turkey's place in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

Turkey's relationship with the West, though historically complex, has been thrown into unprecedented doubt over the past decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. This includes serious domestic challenges to democratic values and human rights norms, alongside an increasingly nationalistic foreign policy, including close ties with [[turkeys_evolving_foreign_relations_especially_with_russia_and_the_us | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. The question remains whether the Turkish Republic will finally break that relationship, or if the United States and EU will allow it to happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

The complex interplay between [[international_relations_and_state_borders | international relations]] and national identity is nowhere more evident than in the Balkans. A long-standing dispute between Bulgaria and North Macedonia, particularly highlighted by Bulgaria's repeated blocking of North Macedonia's European Union accession talks in June 2021, underscores the profound importance of identity issues in shaping inter-state relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Understanding Nationhood

Unlike a state, which confers citizenship, the concept of nationhood is a more fluid idea of a people linked by shared bonds of language, history, and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Sometimes, a people living across two states may identify as a single nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. At other times, two peoples who once shared historical bonds may come to view themselves as wholly distinct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Disagreements arise when one group sees another as part of a single nation, while the other asserts its separate identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## The Bulgaria-North Macedonia Dispute: A Case Study

The dispute between Bulgaria and North Macedonia serves as a contemporary example of these identity clashes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Both countries are located in Southeast Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Bulgaria, with approximately 7 million people, is the 103rd largest UN member, while North Macedonia, with an estimated 2.1 million, is the 145th largest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Both are predominantly Slavic-speaking Christian Orthodox countries, but also have significant non-Slavic Muslim minorities, such as ethnic Turks in Bulgaria (9%) and ethnic Albanians in North Macedonia (around 35%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

The core of their disagreement lies in their differing ethnolinguistic origins and interpretations of history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

### Historical Context

The story of the dispute largely begins with the decline of the Ottoman Empire in the late 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

*   **Bulgarian Expansionism** In 1878, the Principality of Bulgaria was established as an autonomous state within the Ottoman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. From its inception, the nascent Bulgarian state laid claim to neighbouring areas still under Ottoman rule, notably Thrace and Macedonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   **The Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (VMRO)** In the 1890s, the VMRO emerged, dedicated to the liberation of the Macedonian region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. However, Macedonia was also claimed by neighbouring Greece and Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Balkan Wars and World Wars** Bulgaria allied with Greece, Serbia, and Montenegro in 1912 to expel the Ottomans from Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. While Bulgaria gained Thrace, it only secured a small part of Macedonia, with the majority falling to Greek and Serb forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Bulgaria then sided with Germany in World War I, capturing Serbian-held Macedonia, but this control was short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. The region was retaken by Serbia in 1918 and became part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. During World War II, Bulgaria, allied with Nazi Germany, again occupied most of Serbian and parts of Greek Macedonia, only to relinquish control as the war ended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

### The Emergence of a Distinct Macedonian Identity

World War II marked a turning point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. Rather than being reintegrated into Serbia, the northern part of Macedonia gained autonomy, becoming the Socialist Republic of Macedonia, one of the six constituent republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a> In the following years, a conscious effort was made to foster a wholly distinct [[impact_of_yugoslavia_on_macedonian_identity | Macedonian identity]], emphasizing a unique relationship, history, language, and culture separate from neighbouring Bulgaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. By the 1970s, Macedonian, while mutually intelligible with Bulgarian, was officially recognized as a separate language by the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

This sense of nationhood became prominent with the disintegration of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. On September 8, 1991, Socialist Macedonia voted to become the sovereign state of the Republic of Macedonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

### Post-Independence Identity Disputes

The newly independent Republic of Macedonia immediately faced an identity dispute with Greece, which accused it of harbouring territorial claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Greece blocked its path to EU membership until a new name was agreed upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. After nearly 30 years of UN mediation, the Prespa Agreement in June 2018 renamed the country the Republic of North Macedonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. This resolution was widely seen as a step towards stabilizing the Western Balkans and opening the path for EU accession talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

However, jubilation was short-lived as another identity dispute emerged with Bulgaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Unlike Greece, Bulgaria recognized the Macedonian state (being the first country to do so) but disputed the existence of a separate Macedonian nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

### Bulgaria's Stance

Bulgaria views the Slavic population of Macedonia as part of the wider Bulgarian nation, and the Macedonian language as a dialect of Bulgarian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Additionally, Bulgaria is concerned about a clause in the Macedonian Constitution that allows the country to protect the interests of Macedonians in neighbouring states. Bulgaria sees this as a potential pretext for interference in its domestic affairs or even a claim to its territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

### Attempts at Resolution and Renewed Tensions

*   **1999 Joint Declaration** In 1999, the two countries signed an 11-point declaration appearing to settle the matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Macedonia formally renounced any claim to Bulgaria's territory and clarified its constitution could not be interpreted as a basis for interfering in Bulgaria's internal affairs to defend non-Macedonian citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. Bulgaria, by explicitly acknowledging the declaration in both Bulgarian and Macedonian, seemed to address the language issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   **Continued Discord** Despite the agreement, tensions persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. A nationalist government in Macedonia intensified tensions with both Bulgaria and Greece, portraying Bulgaria negatively in institutions like the Museum of the Macedonian Struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. An acrimonious dispute also arose over the national identity of key VMRO figures, such as Gotse Delchev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
*   **EU Accession Blockade** Bulgaria, which joined the EU in 2007, began using its leverage to block North Macedonia's EU accession talks unless these points of contention were resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
*   **2017 Friendship Treaty** The situation appeared to ease in 2017 with a more moderate Macedonian government, leading to the signing of a friendship treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. This treaty reaffirmed territorial integrity and established a joint commission to address historical differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
*   **Renewed Demands and Vetoes** However, little progress was made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. In October 2019, Bulgaria issued over 20 demands and advised the EU to stop referring to the "Macedonian language," instead suggesting "the official language of the Republic of North Macedonia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. In October 2020, and again in June 2021, Bulgaria vetoed the start of membership negotiations with North Macedonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.

## International Reaction and the Irony of Identity

Bulgaria's repeated vetoes have been heavily criticized by its European partners, who are "fed up" with a stance seen as "incomprehensible, indefensible and destabilis[ing] the Western Balkans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. In Skopje, Deputy Prime Minister Nikola Dimitrov stated that "Who we are is our business. It's a question for the Macedonian people. We think that this should by no means be a precondition for our European future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

The dispute highlights a core clash:
*   **Bulgaria's perspective**: The [[impact_of_yugoslavia_on_macedonian_identity | Macedonian identity]] is seen as a deliberate Yugoslav policy to demonize Bulgaria, and Slavic Macedonians are "really and truly Bulgarians" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.
*   **North Macedonia's perspective**: They assert their own separate national identity that must be acknowledged and respected, regardless of Bulgaria's acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

Ironically, Bulgaria's persistent attempts to deny a distinct Macedonian identity may inadvertently be solidifying it further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

In recent months, mass demonstrations have erupted in Georgia, with thousands protesting a new law critics say stifles democracy and indicates a drift towards Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. These accusations come despite parts of the country remaining under Russian occupation and the government openly supporting European Union membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Geopolitical Context and Recent History

Georgia is located in the [[geopolitical_dynamics_in_the_caucasus_region|Caucasus]], bordered by Russia to the north, Azerbaijan to the southeast, Armenia and Turkey to the south, and the Black Sea to its west <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. Its total area is approximately 70,000 square kilometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. Around 20% of the country's territory, specifically the regions of [[abkhazias_current_political_unrest|Abkhazia]] and South Ossetia, have unilaterally declared independence, recognized only by Russia and a few other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. The population of Georgia is around 3.7 million, with ethnic Georgians making up almost 90%, followed mainly by Azeris and Armenians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. The country is predominantly Eastern Orthodox Christian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

Georgia has a long and complex [[georgias_history_with_russia_and_territorial_conflicts|history with Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. In 1783, one of the Georgian kingdoms sought protection from Imperial Russia, a decision that led to its annexation within 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. By the mid-19th century, the Georgian people were entirely under Russian control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. After the collapse of Tsarist Russia in 1917, Georgia briefly formed the Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic, then declared independence as the Democratic Republic of Georgia on May 26, 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. This lasted only three years, as the Red Army invaded in February 1921, incorporating Georgia into the Soviet Union as the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic for the next 70 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.

### Post-Soviet Independence and Conflicts

Georgia declared independence on April 9, 1991, and formally gained statehood upon the dissolution of the Soviet Union at the end of that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. It joined the United Nations in 1992 and initially the Russian-led Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.

From the start, Georgia faced significant challenges, including a civil war and attempts by South Ossetia and [[abkhazias_current_political_unrest|Abkhazia]] to break away, leading to violent clashes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. These conflicts ended with Kremlin-brokered ceasefires policed by Russian troops, straining relations between Moscow and Tbilisi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. Eduard Shevardnadze, president from 1992, attempted to maintain working ties with Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.

### The Rose Revolution and the 2008 War

In 2003, the Rose Revolution peacefully overthrew Shevardnadze due to a lack of movement on breakaway territories, chronic economic problems, and corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>. Mikheil Saakashvili, a pro-Western lawyer, became president, vowing to move Georgia closer to the European Union and NATO, which led to a sharp deterioration in relations with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>.

In August 2008, war erupted between Georgia and Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>. Russia quickly achieved a decisive victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. Soon after, Russia recognized South Ossetia and [[abkhazias_current_political_unrest|Abkhazia]] as independent states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>. This conflict marked a decisive break, with Tbilisi cutting diplomatic ties to Moscow and withdrawing from the CIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>. Saakashvili's standing was damaged, facing accusations of recklessly stirring tensions and his administration was criticized for increasing authoritarianism, corruption, and human rights abuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>.

## The Georgian Dream Era and Shifting Orientations

In 2012, Saakashvili's United National Movement was defeated in parliamentary elections by the Georgian Dream coalition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>. Its billionaire leader, Bidzina Ivanishvili, who made his fortune in post-Soviet Russia, attracted considerable attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>.

Despite Ivanishvili's background, the new government maintained a pro-Western orientation, signing an Association Agreement with the EU in 2014 and opening a joint training center with NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>. However, it also adopted a more conciliatory approach towards Russia, believing that avoiding antagonizing Moscow was necessary to regain lost territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>. Efforts began to normalize relations by focusing on trade, travel, and humanitarian cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>.

### Accusations of Pro-Russian Sentiment

While Georgia condemned Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014, it refused to impose sanctions against Russia, unlike EU and NATO states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>. The government argued this was pragmatic, but the opposition increasingly accused it of pro-Russian sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>. This intensified in June 2019 after a Russian lawmaker visited the Georgian Parliament, sparking mass demonstrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>. Observers began to see parallels with Russia under Putin, noting concerns about the Georgian government's democratic record, including allegations of backsliding on judicial independence and media freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>. Growing Russian disinformation aimed at encouraging extremism and anti-Western messages also seemed to contribute to these concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>.

### Response to the Ukraine War and EU Aspirations

Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 brought these tensions to a head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>. While Georgians instinctively supported Ukraine, the Georgian government continued to balance its position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>. It condemned the attack and voted in favor of UN resolutions against Moscow but still refused to impose sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>.

Despite these concerns, Georgia applied to join the European Union alongside Moldova and Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>. However, unlike the other two, Georgia was not immediately granted candidacy but was given 12 priorities to address, including democratic reforms, rule of law, and countering foreign disinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>.

## Controversial Legislation and Internal Protests

Concern grew when the government introduced controversial legislation requiring any organization receiving over 20% of its income from an external source to register as an "agent of foreign influence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>. This law closely mirrored legislation introduced in Russia a decade earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>. Facing significant internal opposition and criticism from the EU and the United States, the government initially dropped the plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>, and in December 2023, Georgia was formally granted EU candidacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>.

However, the government sparked outrage just a few months later by reintroducing the foreign agents legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>. Despite mass demonstrations and strong criticism from the EU and the United States, who warned of serious consequences, the government refused to back down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>. On May 28, it overrode a veto from the pro-Western president and passed the law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>.

The government denies accusations of being under Moscow's influence, calling such claims opposition disinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a>. However, its rhetoric has taken a distinctly pro-Russian turn, with strange conspiracy theories and Kremlin disinformation talking points emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>. For example, Ivanishvili, the effective leader of the Georgian Dream, has accused a "Global War Party" of being behind the conflict in Ukraine and even forcing Georgia and Russia into war in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:19:00">[11:19:00]</a>.

## Underlying Motivations and Future Outlook

The situation in Georgia is complex and open to interpretation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>. While some interpret current developments as a drift towards Moscow, another explanation is the government's attempt to strengthen its position before parliamentary elections later this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a>. With the opposition fragmented and weak, and the government enjoying relatively little public support, it appears to be trying to hinder the opposition and shore up its base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00">[12:06:00]</a>. This also explains the introduction of new anti-LGBT legislation, which resonates with older voters in a socially conservative country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a>.

This strategy runs counter to the demands of Georgia's Western partners and poses a serious problem for the government given that support for EU membership in Georgia runs as high as 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>. The government risks losing power unless it can reduce support for EU integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:00">[12:43:00]</a>.

This situation makes Georgia's direction particularly worrying. Even if the government is not overtly pro-Russian, its pushback against the EU for internal survival provides Moscow an ideal opportunity to exert influence, as Russia does not condition its support on the rule of law or democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:55:00">[12:55:00]</a>. Similar dynamics can be observed in nearby [[current_political_tensions_in_gagauzia|Moldova]], where pro-Russian support exists despite Russian occupation of part of its territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:12:00">[13:12:00]</a>. Moscow may not need a complete Georgian realignment; it simply needs to divide society enough to reduce Western influence and high levels of support for Euro-Atlantic integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:00">[13:34:00]</a>.

The ultimate aims of Russia and the Georgian Dream government appear to be steadily converging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:00">[13:54:00]</a>. As Georgia heads to pivotal elections, President Salome Zourabichvili is leading efforts to challenge the government, framing it as a chance to put Georgia back on a European path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01:00">[14:01:00]</a>. The next few months could determine Georgia's future orientation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>.

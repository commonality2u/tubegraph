During the [[racial_segregation_policies_during_apartheid | apartheid]] era, South Africa established four nominally independent states known as Bantustans or homelands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These were designed to perpetuate [[racial_segregation_policies_during_apartheid | apartheid]], the system of racial segregation that underpinned white minority rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The International Community never recognised these four so-called states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, raising questions about statehood and [[international_recognition_and_sovereignty_of_bantustans | sovereignty]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Statehood and Sovereignty

Traditionally, states have the right to determine their borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This includes the ability to cede territory to another state or allow it to become a separate sovereign and independent country, provided it's done through constitutional procedures and without coercion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. However, the Bantustans represent a unique case where the international community decided that a country was not permitted to declare parts of its territory independent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

The term "Bantustan" is a hybrid word, combining "Bantu" (a leading language group in South Africa) with "-stan" (often used to designate countries in Central Asia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. These homelands were specifically designed to reinforce the institutionalised racism of the [[racial_segregation_policies_during_apartheid | apartheid]] system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, leading to considerable [[international_condemnation_of_apartheid_policies | international condemnation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Historical Context

South Africa, at 1.2 million square kilometers, is the 24th largest country globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. It shares borders with Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Eswatini, and Lesotho <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Its current population is around 60 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, with 80% Black Africans, 9% Coloreds (mixed race), 8% Whites, and 2.5% Asian or Indian, according to the 2011 census <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. The country is highly diverse, with 11 official languages, including Zulu (23%), Xhosa (16%), Afrikaans, and English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

European explorers arrived in South Africa in the 15th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. By the 17th century, the Dutch had established a settlement at the Cape of Good Hope, leading to the development of a distinct Afrikaans identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. This eventually led to the creation of two Afrikaaner states in the 1850s: the South African Republic and the Orange Free State <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Britain seized control of the Cape in 1795 and expanded its holdings, clashing with various groups, including the Zulu, and eventually the Dutch-speaking republics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

In 1902, Britain annexed the South African Republic and the Orange Free State after the Second Boer War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. On May 31, 1910, the various colonies were merged to form the Union of South Africa, a Dominion of the British Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. South Africa gained effective independence under the Statute of Westminster in 1931, retaining the British monarch as head of state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

Despite British influence, most white inhabitants remained Afrikaans speakers, with deep divisions within the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. This led to the formation of the National Party in 1914 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>, which came to power in 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

### Institution of Apartheid

While discrimination against black South Africans had a long history, including the 1913 National Land Act which deprived them of land ownership in white-held areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>, the National Party instituted a formal policy of [[racial_segregation_policies_during_apartheid | racial segregation]] known as [[racial_segregation_policies_during_apartheid | apartheid]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

Key legislation included:
*   **Population Registration Act (1950)**: Required all South Africans to be defined as Black, White, or Coloured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   **Group Areas Act (1950)**: Established separate residential and business areas for different races <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. This act led to millions of black South Africans being forcibly evicted from their lands designated for whites only <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

## Creation of the Bantustans

The Bantustans became a central component of the [[racial_segregation_policies_during_apartheid | apartheid]] system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   **Bantu Authorities Act (1951)**: Granted authority to tribal leaders and councils within traditional homelands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   **Promotion of Bantu Self-Government Act (1959)**: Laid the groundwork for self-rule in these areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   **Republic of South Africa (1961)**: Amidst growing [[international_condemnation_of_apartheid_policies | international criticism]] and refusal to decolonize Southwest Africa (now Namibia), South Africa abolished the Queen as head of state and became a republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. This facilitated the formal establishment of homelands, initially as self-governing territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
*   **Transkei (1963)**: Became the first of eventually 10 Bantustans in South Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. An additional 10 autonomous homelands were also designated in Southwest Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   **Homeland Citizenship Act (1970)**: Declared every Black South African a citizen of one of the homelands, regardless of their current residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Bantu Homelands Constitution Act (1971)**: Empowered the government to grant independence to any homeland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

## International Outcry and Non-Recognition

The move towards independent homelands sparked an [[international_condemnation_of_apartheid_policies | international outcry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   **UN General Assembly Resolution (November 1971)**: Condemned the creation of self-governing Bantustans and the forced relocation of people, arguing these policies aimed to divide tribes and weaken the rights of Black Africans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   **Further UN General Assembly Resolution**: Called on all governments and organisations not to deal with or recognise any institutions of the Bantustans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

Despite these warnings, South Africa proceeded, announcing the creation of the first independent homeland, the Republic of Transkei, on October 26, 1976 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. This act immediately and devastatingly made every black South African assigned Transkei citizenship a "foreigner" in South Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

The UN General Assembly and Security Council condemned this move and called on members not to recognise them as states or engage in dealings with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Undeterred, South Africa created three more: Bophuthatswana (1977), Venda (1979), and Ciskei (1981) â€“ known as the TBVC States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. These entities, some fragmented like Bophuthatswana, were never recognised by any UN members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Lesotho, bordering Transkei, resisted South African pressure and did not recognise it, a stance praised by the UN Security Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

*Note: The Bantustan legislation did not create Lesotho or Eswatini (formerly Swaziland). These were separate British protectorates that gained independence in 1966 and 1968, respectively, and became UN members.* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>

## [[the_end_of_apartheid_and_reintegration_of_bantustans | End of Apartheid and Reintegration]]

The [[the_end_of_apartheid_and_reintegration_of_bantustans | end of Apartheid]] led to the demise of the Bantustans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. Following decades of pressure and sanctions, the [[racial_segregation_policies_during_apartheid | apartheid]] system began to crumble in the late 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

*   **Namibia's Independence (1990)**: The 10 self-governing Bantustans in Southwest Africa ceased to exist when South Africa withdrew from the territory, and Namibia became an independent UN member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
*   **Transition in South Africa**: South Africa moved towards a post-[[racial_segregation_policies_during_apartheid | apartheid]] era, with multi-party talks leading to an interim constitution for a multi-racial democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. The UN General Assembly called for the peaceful reincorporation of the homelands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
*   **Reintegration Process**: South Africa prepared to take over the Bantustans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. While Transkei and Venda accepted reintegration, Ciskei and Bophuthatswana initially resisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.
*   **Bophuthatswana Crisis (1994)**: A strike by civil servants supporting reintegration led to Bophuthatswana's president, Lucas Mangope, calling for help from Afrikaaner nationalists, resulting in violence and a military mutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. Mangope fled on March 11, and the South African government appointed an interim administrator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. Ciskei subsequently accepted reincorporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
*   **Repeal of Legislation (April 27, 1994)**: On the first day of the interim constitution, the South African Parliament repealed the legislation that created all 10 Bantustans (both the four nominally independent and the six under South African rule) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. The new constitutional order applied to all parts of the country, and South Africa became a united state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

## Conclusion: A Unique Anomaly

The Bantustans represent a unique case study in [[international_recognition_and_sovereignty_of_bantustans | international relations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. While states generally have the right to determine their borders and allow parts of their territory to become independent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>, the international community rejected the independence of the Bantustans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. This rejection was not primarily based on their capacity to be states (though their economic and political reliance on South Africa did raise questions about their true independence) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. Instead, the [[international_condemnation_of_apartheid_policies | international condemnation]] stemmed from the fact that they were deliberately designed to thwart the human rights and self-determination of the majority black population of South Africa and support the racist policy of [[racial_segregation_policies_during_apartheid | Apartheid]], which was deemed a crime against humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

The four so-called independent Bantustans stand as a fascinating anomaly in modern international relations: the only example of a country granting independence to part of its territory, only for that independence to be rejected by the wider international community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

The 1995 Quebec referendum on independence represented a pivotal moment in Canadian history, with the province coming "incredibly close" to voting to separate from Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. On October 30, 1995, the "No" side won by a margin of just over 50,000 votes out of nearly 5 million cast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This narrow defeat, while significant, led to crucial legal developments and a notable shift in the dynamics of the [[quebec_independence_movement | Quebec independence movement]].

## The 1995 Referendum

The second referendum on Quebec sovereignty took place on October 30, 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. The Parti Québécois, having returned to power, campaigned on a platform of sovereignty with shared functions with Canada, such as a common currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. The turnout was remarkably high at 93.5%, with four and three-quarter million votes cast out of just over five million registered voters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. The final result was incredibly tight, with the proposals defeated by 50.6% to 49.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>, amounting to just under 55,000 votes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

## Legal and Constitutional Developments

The close call of the 1995 referendum prompted significant actions from the Canadian federal government:

*   **Supreme Court Reference (1998)**: The Canadian Government requested a ruling from the country's Supreme Court on whether Quebec could unilaterally secede <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. On August 20, 1998, the Court ruled that there was no right to unilateral secession under Canadian or international law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. However, the Court also importantly noted that if Quebec clearly voted to secede, Canada should not deny them that right, and both parties should negotiate in good faith, recognizing the interests of other provinces and the federal government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

*   **Clarity Act (2000)**: In July 2000, the Canadian Parliament passed the Clarity Act, which set out the framework for handling future secession questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. Key stipulations included:
    *   Any referendum question must be clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
    *   In the event of a vote for independence, negotiations on separation must include all Canadian provinces and indigenous peoples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
    *   Any act of secession would require an amendment to the Canadian constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.
    This act established that secession, while possible, must be done in a democratic and consensual manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Although Quebec has refused to officially accept the Clarity Act, it nevertheless provides a potential framework for future secession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

## Shifting Support for Independence

In the quarter-century since the 1995 referendum, support for [[quebec_independence_movement | independence]] has significantly declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. Today, support for independence ranges between a quarter and a third of the population, with a clear majority voting against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. This is further reflected in political support, as the two largest parties in Quebec, which garnered three-quarters of the electorate in the 2018 provincial elections, both oppose independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

Several factors contribute to this decline:
*   **Shift to Autonomy**: There has been a shift in focus from outright independence to pursuing greater political and cultural autonomy within Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. Quebec nationalism remains strong, with the largest party in Quebec, despite opposing independence, supporting increased autonomy for the province <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
*   **Language Preservation**: Measures taken to preserve Quebec's French language identity have helped ease fears of English encroachment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
*   [[demographic_changes_and_their_impact_on_quebecs_independence_sentiment | **Demographic Changes**]]: Unlike many other places where pro-independence support is stronger among the young, in Quebec, it is the opposite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. Those supporting separation tend to be over 55, while younger generations are more at ease with a dual Canadian and Francophone identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. Only about a quarter of young people would vote for independence, suggesting a continued decline in support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

## Future Outlook

Despite the decline in support, it is "still perhaps too early to say that the [[quebec_independence_movement | independence movement]] is at an end in Quebec" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. It continues to command significant support, and many in Quebec believe it could make a comeback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. Polling indicates that while 40% believe the sovereignty movement has passed, almost half believe it will one day return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

Immigration is a crucial factor, as the number of English- and non-French speakers is projected to increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. Statistics Canada suggests the Francophone population could decline to between 69-72% by 2036 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. The question remains whether this will further dilute support for independence or "feed a renewed sense of Francophone nativism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

Despite coming "remarkably close to passing" in 1995, calls for independence have subsided in Quebec over the past quarter-century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. While still the most serious independence movement in the Americas, the numbers supporting statehood are significantly lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. Having secured an explicit route to independence through legal frameworks, and taking steps to preserve its distinct [[cultural_and_linguistic_identity_in_quebec | cultural identity]], Quebec currently seems disinclined to separate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. This makes Quebec a fascinating case study in [[history_of_quebecs_independence_movement | secession and independence movements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

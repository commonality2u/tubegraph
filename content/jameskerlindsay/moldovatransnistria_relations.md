In March 2024, authorities in the Moldovan breakaway region of [[Transnistria and its geopolitical significance | Transnistria]] issued an urgent appeal to Russia for assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This appeal comes amidst speculation that Moldova might leverage the ongoing conflict in Ukraine to regain control of [[Transnistria and its geopolitical significance | Transnistria]], a territory that has been under Russia's protection for over three decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Moscow has publicly cautioned that any use of force would be considered a direct assault on Russia itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Approaches to Reintegrating Breakaway Territories

In modern international relations, the prevailing view is that de facto states, like [[Transnistria and its geopolitical significance | Transnistria]], should be peacefully reintegrated through negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. However, such discussions can often be protracted and unproductive, leading to a "frozen conflict" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Some countries, therefore, consider military action to retake such territories, especially if circumstances change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. A recent example of this approach is Azerbaijan's successful military campaign to retake Nagorno-Karabakh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

Moldova has been committed to a peaceful resolution of the [[Transnistria and its geopolitical significance | Transnistrian]] dispute for over 30 years, but this has not led to a breakthrough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. With Russia currently engaged in Ukraine, some suggest that this might be an opportune moment for Moldova to attempt to retake the territory by force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## Geographical and Demographic Overview

The Republic of Moldova is a landlocked country in Eastern Europe, bordering Ukraine to the north, east, and south, and Romania to its west <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. It covers an area of approximately 34,000 km² (13,000 square miles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Moldova's population stands at around 2.6 million, with Romanian-speaking Moldovans forming the majority. About 7% of the population are Ukrainians, and 4% are ethnic Russians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

[[Transnistria and its geopolitical significance | Transnistria]] is a thin strip of territory along Moldova's eastern border with Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. It is roughly 200 km long and just over 2 km wide at its narrowest point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. [[Transnistria and its geopolitical significance | Transnistria]] comprises about 4,200 km² (1,600 square miles), which is around 10% of Moldova's total territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. According to its 2015 census, [[Transnistria and its geopolitical significance | Transnistria]] had a population of about 475,000, with Russians and Moldovans each making up around 30%, and Ukrainians comprising roughly a quarter of the inhabitants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

## [[Historical background of Transnistria and Moldova | Historical Context of Moldova and Transnistria]]

Moldova originated as the Principality of Moldavia in the Middle Ages, serving as a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. In the early 19th century, following the Russo-Turkish War, its eastern provinces, known as Bessarabia, were ceded to Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Although the Kingdom of Romania, formed by the union of Moldavia and Wallachia, claimed Bessarabia, the area remained under Russian imperial rule until the 1917 Russian Revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Bessarabia then broke away and united with Romania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

The newly formed Soviet Union refused to recognize Bessarabia's incorporation into Romania and maintained its claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. To this end, the USSR established the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (MASSR) within the Ukrainian SSR, operating from the east bank of the Dniester River <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. With the onset of the Second World War, Moscow reclaimed Bessarabia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. On August 2, 1940, Bessarabia and the area on the Dniester River's eastern bank, known as Trans-Dniester or [[Transnistria and its geopolitical significance | Transnistria]], were merged to form the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic (MSSR), a new top-level republic of the USSR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

After establishing sovereignty over Moldova at the end of WWII, the Soviet leadership introduced ethnic Russians to control the new republic and dilute Romanian nationalist sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. By the late 1980s, Ukrainians and Russians accounted for about a quarter of the population, many concentrated in [[Transnistria and its geopolitical significance | Transnistria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. As the Soviet Union weakened, Moldova's communist leadership began to emphasize the republic's Romanian heritage, which fueled tensions with [[Transnistria and its geopolitical significance | Transnistria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

### Breakaway and Conflict (1991-1992)

In August 1991, [[Transnistria and its geopolitical significance | Transnistrian]] leaders declared their region's secession, forming the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (PMR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. On March 2, 1992, the same day the newly independent Republic of Moldova joined the United Nations, fighting erupted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Russian troops stationed in [[Transnistria and its geopolitical significance | Transnistria]] intervened as clashes intensified between Moldovan and [[Transnistria and its geopolitical significance | Transnistrian]] forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. A ceasefire was agreed upon four and a half months later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

Under the agreement, the Russian Federation contributed troops to an international peacekeeping force and maintained a separate military contingent in [[Transnistria and its geopolitical significance | Transnistria]], thus becoming the guarantor of the de facto state's existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Despite UN General Assembly calls for withdrawal, approximately 1,500 Russian troops remain in [[Transnistria and its geopolitical significance | Transnistria]] to this day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

### Stalemate and Russian Influence

International efforts to resolve the [[Transnistria and its geopolitical significance | Transnistrian]] issue over subsequent decades consistently failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Neither side was inclined to reach a resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>:
*   **Moldova's perspective:** Many in Moldova feared that a settlement would introduce more Russian speakers, thereby strengthening Moscow's influence over the country's domestic affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   **[[Transnistria and its geopolitical significance | Transnistria]]'s perspective:** Existing on the margins of international law, [[Transnistria and its geopolitical significance | Transnistria]] had little desire to give up subsidies from Russia or earnings from smuggling and organized crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
*   **Russia's benefit:** The unresolved conflict served Moscow's interests by preventing Moldova from moving closer to the West, as neither the EU nor NATO would be interested in admitting a divided state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Moldova is also constitutionally committed to neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

## [[Impact of the Ukraine war on Transnistria | Impact of the Ukraine War]]

The [[Impact of the Ukraine war on Transnistria | war in Ukraine]], which began after 30 years of relative peace, drastically altered the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. A year prior, Moldova had elected a staunchly pro-European president, Maia Sandu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Concerns arose that Moldova could become Russia's next target if Russian forces seized control of Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. These fears were amplified by a series of attacks in [[Transnistria and its geopolitical significance | Transnistria]] in mid-2022, perceived by many as a pretext for a Russian invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

In response, Moldova took urgent steps to align more closely with the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. While some suggested abandoning neutrality and joining NATO, Moldova instead focused on EU membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. It applied to join the EU in March 2022, was granted candidate status three months later, and was cleared to begin formal membership talks in December 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

The threat of a Russian military invasion of Moldova has since receded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. Despite limited progress in Ukraine's counteroffensive in June 2023, the prospect of Russian forces breaking through southern Ukraine to link up with their garrison in [[Transnistria and its geopolitical significance | Transnistria]]—a major fear at the start of the war—has diminished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. This strategic shift has significantly influenced the debate over [[Transnistria and its geopolitical significance | Transnistria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

With the apparent threat of Russian invasion gone, attention has shifted to the possibility of Moldova attempting to retake [[Transnistria and its geopolitical significance | Transnistria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. Calls for this were reinforced by Azerbaijan's military offensive against Nagorno-Karabakh, which saw Baku regain control after 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Moscow has warned that any forceful resolution by Moldova would be considered a direct attack on Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated that Russia would protect its 200,000 citizens in [[Transnistria and its geopolitical significance | Transnistria]] and Moldova <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

However, the Moldovan government has dismissed the idea of Russian retaliation, asserting that Russia's military options have collapsed due to being cut off from [[Transnistria and its geopolitical significance | Transnistria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. Moldova has indeed become more assertive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. This was evident when Ukraine closed its border with [[Transnistria and its geopolitical significance | Transnistria]], severely impacting trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Moldova then introduced tariffs on goods entering [[Transnistria and its geopolitical significance | Transnistria]] from its side, a move [[Transnistria and its geopolitical significance | Transnistrian]] leaders termed an "economic blockade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

These actions led [[Transnistria and its geopolitical significance | Transnistrian]] authorities to convene a "Congress of Deputies at all Levels" at the end of February 2024, the first such high-level meeting in 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. While the Congress appealed to Moscow for help, it notably did not request formal annexation, as many observers had anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:10:00]</a>.

## Prospects for Reintegration

Despite calls for Moldova to retake [[Transnistria and its geopolitical significance | Transnistria]] by force, military action remains highly improbable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

### Reasons Against Military Action

*   **Commitment to Peace:** Moldova has consistently advocated for a peaceful resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. Unlike many other separatist conflicts, there has not been deep ethnic hostility between the two sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. While Moldova has increased its efforts to assert control, there are no indications of a military solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.
*   **Military Weakness:** Moldova's armed forces are small and comparatively weak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. Although the country has announced increased defense spending and modernization plans, it is not prepared for an invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
*   **Potential Resistance:** Even if an invasion were attempted, success is not guaranteed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. Despite the small and isolated Russian military garrison in [[Transnistria and its geopolitical significance | Transnistria]], [[Transnistria and its geopolitical significance | Transnistrians]] might resist a forcible attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. [[Transnistria and its geopolitical significance | Transnistria]] is also reportedly increasing its security forces in response to perceived threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   **Lack of Outside Assistance:** External forces may not necessarily aid Moldova if a military conflict escalates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. NATO, for example, has avoided deploying combat troops in Ukraine and might do the same in Moldova <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. However, NATO member Romania might decide to intervene in such a situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.
*   **Political Risks:** Forcible integration carries significant political risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. While pro-European sentiment dominates in Moldova, many ordinary Moldovans remain pro-Russian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. The fear is that forced integration of [[Transnistria and its geopolitical significance | Transnistria]] could paradoxically strengthen pro-Russian support within Moldova, making Moscow even more influential than if [[Transnistria and its geopolitical significance | Transnistria]] remains politically "quarantined" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

### Signs of Waning Russian Influence and European Alignment

A "softly-softly" approach by Moldova makes more sense given signs that Moscow's influence in [[Transnistria and its geopolitical significance | Transnistria]] may be waning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. For example, turnout for the recent Russian presidential election was significantly lower in [[Transnistria and its geopolitical significance | Transnistria]] than in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

Simultaneously, [[Transnistria and its geopolitical significance | Transnistria]] may be slowly moving towards Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. With Russia cut off, trade with the European Union has substantially increased, now accounting for about 70% of [[Transnistria and its geopolitical significance | Transnistria]]'s imports and exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

For these reasons, Moldova may be better off allowing the current situation to persist, at least for now, rather than forcing reintegration through a potentially costly conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. A peaceful, organic reunification may still be possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

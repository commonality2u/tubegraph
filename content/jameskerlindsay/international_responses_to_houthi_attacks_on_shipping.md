The Red Sea, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes, has seen a growing threat to vessels since the start of the conflict in Gaza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Attacks originating from Yemen have led many companies to suspend traffic through the area, causing disruptions to [[impact_of_the_yemen_conflict_on_global_trade|global trade]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. In response, the United States launched a multinational naval task force to address the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, though concerns exist that this could affect peace and security across the Wider Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Background to the Houthi Threat

Yemen's brutal [[yemen_civil_war_and_its_impact_on_regional_stability|civil war]] has been a threat to regional stability for almost a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. The conflict gained worldwide prominence with the start of the conflict in Gaza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, when the leading rebel group in the country began attacking ships in the [[maritime_security_threats_in_the_red_sea|Red Sea]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

The Houthi Movement, also known as Ansar Allah, is an Islamist group that has been fighting government forces in Yemen since 2004 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Created to protect the interests of Yemen's Shia Muslims, the group is supported by Iran as part of its efforts to destabilize the Gulf region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:08:01]</a>. In September 2014, Houthi forces seized the capital, Sanaa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>, and allied with troops loyal to former president Saleh, they reached Aden, the new home of the national government, within six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:16]</a>. By March 2015, President Hadi had fled the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

The [[yemen_civil_war_and_its_impact_on_regional_stability|conflict in Yemen]] escalated dramatically when Arab states, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, intervened with the support of Western countries like the United States, Britain, and France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:42]</a>. These nations feared Yemen falling to Iranian-backed forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

## Houthi Attacks on Shipping

Following the start of the [[israels_defense_and_international_reactions|Israeli]] attack against Hamas, the Houthis announced they would target any ships destined for [[israels_defense_and_international_reactions|Israel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:38]</a>. Several major incidents have occurred since:
*   **Hijackings:** In November, a British-registered vessel was hijacked and towed into a Houthi-controlled port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:49]</a>.
*   **Drone and Missile Strikes:** The group has launched numerous drone and missile strikes against shipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. While many were thwarted by US, French, and British warships, several hit their targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:12:01]</a>.

## Impact on Global Trade

The growing danger and rising insurance costs have prompted many large ship owners, including Danish giant Maersk and Swiss-owned Mediterranean Shipping Company (the world's largest container shipping firm), to suspend operations in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:16]</a>. Oil giant BP, which operates a fleet of tankers, has also suspended operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. This interruption to a crucial trade route could have significant ripple effects on the international economy, particularly as many countries are working to control inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:36]</a>.

## International Response: Operation Prosperity Guardian

The threat to [[impact_of_the_yemen_conflict_on_global_trade|global trade]] prompted the United States to act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. On December 18, 2023, the US announced the creation of a new naval task force, "Operation Prosperity Guardian" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. This task force, composed of ten countries—the United States, Britain, France, Italy, Netherlands, Canada, Norway, Spain, the Seychelles, and Bahrain—aims to protect shipping in the [[maritime_security_threats_in_the_red_sea|Red Sea]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:13:00]</a>. Notably, it does not include any other Red Sea states or Arab states besides Bahrain, where the mission will be based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:11]</a>.

## Challenges and Risks

While Operation Prosperity Guardian is critical for world trade, there are concerns that it could destabilize the region if not handled carefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:23]</a>.

*   **Regional Peace Talks:** Saudi Arabia, a crucial Red Sea state, has chosen not to participate in the mission, likely due to ongoing peace talks aimed at ending the [[yemen_civil_war_and_its_impact_on_regional_stability|Yemen civil war]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:33]</a>. The UAE has also not joined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.
*   **Destabilizing Yemen:** Launching strikes against the Houthis, while potentially justified, could upset the delicate situation on the ground in Yemen and reignite fighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:48]</a>. Such action could plunge Yemen back into its brutal [[yemen_civil_war_and_its_impact_on_regional_stability|civil war]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:55]</a>.
*   **Iranian Retaliation:** There are fears that a direct US attack on the Houthis could provoke Iranian retaliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:56]</a>. Iran has already issued a warning, with its Defence Minister stating that the US-led task force will face "extraordinary problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:11]</a>.

## Current Strategy and Future Outlook

The United States openly acknowledges the delicate balance between protecting [[maritime_security_threats_in_the_red_sea|maritime safety]] and avoiding destabilization in Yemen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:21]</a>. For now, the US and its allies are treading carefully, shooting down drones and missiles encountered in the region but refraining from direct attacks on the Houthis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:38]</a>. However, if the situation escalates further or the broader economic effects become more pronounced, there may be calls for more direct action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:48]</a>, which could also reignite tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:15:02]</a>.

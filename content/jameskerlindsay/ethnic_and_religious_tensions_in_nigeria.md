[[History and development of Nigeria | Nigeria]], Africa's most populous and resource-rich country, is currently facing a deep crisis marked by widespread [[Security threats and violence in Nigeria | violence]] and instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The country endures daily [[Security threats and violence in Nigeria | violence]] from a wide array of sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Serious doubts persist regarding the [[Role of the Nigerian Government in separatist movements | government's]] capacity to manage the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Diverse Demographics and Historical Roots of Conflict

[[History and development of Nigeria | Nigeria]], a Federal Republic located in West Africa, has a population of almost 220 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. This population comprises over 250 ethno-linguistic groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. The largest groups include the Hausa and Fulani in the north, the Yoruba in the southwest, and the Igbo in the southeast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. Religiously, the country is primarily split between Sunni Muslims in the north and largely Protestant Christians in the south-central and southeast areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. The center and southwest regions have a religiously mixed population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

The roots of current [[Ethnic tensions in Nigeria | ethnic]] and religious tensions trace back to the late 19th century when Britain established two colonial territories, later merged in 1914 to form the Colony and Protectorate of [[History and development of Nigeria | Nigeria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. In 1954, prior to decolonization, the country was reorganized as a federation of three parts: the Hausa and Fulani-dominated Northern Region, the Yoruba-dominated Western Region, and the Igbo-dominated Eastern Region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. [[History and development of Nigeria | Nigeria]] gained independence on October 1, 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

### The Biafran War

Major problems emerged in early 1966 following disputed elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. Southern army officers attempted to overthrow the [[Role of the Nigerian Government in separatist movements | government]], assassinating senior political figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>. This led to reprisal attacks on Igbo people living in the north <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. Over a million Igbo fled to the southeast, where the region unilaterally declared independence as the Republic of Biafra in May 1967 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>. The resulting civil war caused a humanitarian catastrophe, leaving up to 3 million dead from fighting and starvation before the [[Role of the Nigerian Government in separatist movements | government]] defeated Biafran forces in January 1970 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.

## Contemporary Manifestations of Tensions

### Niger Delta and Biafran Separatism

Although [[History and development of Nigeria | Nigeria]] began to recover after the civil war, fueled by its oil industry in the Niger Delta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>, deep discontent emerged by the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. Local communities did not benefit from the oil wealth and suffered severe environmental damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. This led to military crackdowns on dissent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>.

The Delta conflict has also reignited [[Ethnic tensions in Nigeria | tensions]] in the southeast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>. Biafran campaigners, claiming part of the oil-producing region, relaunched their efforts for an independent homeland in the late 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>. This movement is built on decades of lasting resentment and perceived discrimination following the civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. Over the past seven or eight years, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), led by Nnamdi Kanu, has gained prominence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. Kanu is currently on trial in [[History and development of Nigeria | Nigeria]] for terrorism and separatism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>. These activities have resulted in widespread protests and clashes with police in the southeast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>.

### Islamist Violence in the North

While southern tensions are serious, the deteriorating situation in the north has largely overshadowed them over the past decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>. Violent Islamism, which has been growing across West Africa, has brought terror to the northeast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>. This began around 2010 with Boko Haram, which gained international attention in 2014 after kidnapping almost 300 schoolgirls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>. Boko Haram has since been increasingly overshadowed by its rival, ISWAP (Islamic State in West Africa Province) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. This Islamist insurgency has caused over 40,000 deaths and displaced more than 300,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>.

### Herder-Farmer Conflict

A dangerous threat has also emerged in the northwest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>. As [[Impact of climate change on conflicts in Nigeria | climate change]] leads to increased desertification across the Sahel, Muslim Fulani cattle herders have increasingly pushed south into lands held by settled farmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>. This "Herder-Farmer conflict" combines elements of religious and ethnic tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>. It has led to over 10,000 deaths and displaced tens of thousands more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>. Now considered the single biggest [[Security threats and violence in Nigeria | security threat]] in [[History and development of Nigeria | Nigeria]], these well-armed herder bandits are increasingly escalating [[Ethnic tensions in Nigeria | tensions]] elsewhere in the country, including the southeast and southwest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>. The encroachment of herders even prompted IPOB to establish an armed wing, the Eastern Security Network, which has clashed with security forces, further destabilizing the southeast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>.

### Shifting Tensions in the Southwest

The southwest has generally been more peaceful compared to other regions, despite issues like ultra-violent cult gangs in Lagos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>. However, this situation appears to be changing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>. The region has begun to face violent encroachment by Fulani herders, similar to the central and southeast regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>. There are also signs of growing separatist sentiment, though it has not yet led to an organized armed insurgency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>.

A brutal attack on a Catholic church in Owo on June 6, 2022, drew significant attention to the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>. While the perpetrators are unclear, the [[Role of the Nigerian Government in separatist movements | government]] blamed ISWAP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>. Regardless of direct involvement, this mass murder represents a dangerous development in [[History and development of Nigeria | Nigeria]]'s religiously mixed southwest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>.

## Pervasive Insecurity and Underlying Issues

[[History and development of Nigeria | Nigeria]] is now grappling with [[Security threats and violence in Nigeria | insecurity]] and instability across every part of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>. This includes the separatist challenge in the southeast, the ongoing low-level insurgency in the Delta, islamist [[Security threats and violence in Nigeria | violence]] in the northeast potentially spreading to the southwest, and herder bandits terrorizing the center and pushing into the southeast and southwest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a>. Beyond these major threats, there are also numerous localized [[Ethnic tensions in Nigeria | ethno-religious tensions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>.

Critics argue that the [[Role of the Nigerian Government in separatist movements | government's]] response, including increased military and police presence, is insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>. Allegations of widespread human rights abuses by authorities further fuel resentment and discontent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>.

More worryingly, the [[Role of the Nigerian Government in separatist movements | government]] is accused of failing to address the underlying, long-term causes of [[Security threats and violence in Nigeria | violence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:00">[10:58:00]</a>. [[History and development of Nigeria | Nigeria]] is frequently cited as one of the most corrupt countries globally, meaning oil revenues are not invested in local communities, infrastructure, or economic diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:00">[11:04:00]</a>. High youth unemployment (exceeding 40 percent) and a large number of children out of education exacerbate the problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>. [[Impact of climate change on conflicts in Nigeria | Climate change]] also plays a role, as does the proliferation of guns and small arms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:00">[11:35:00]</a>.

The sheer scope of the [[Security threats and violence in Nigeria | violence]] has led to deep concerns about the country's trajectory, with more than 80,000 killed and hundreds of thousands displaced over the past decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:56:00">[11:56:00]</a>. Many now openly question whether [[History and development of Nigeria | Nigeria]] should be considered a failing or even a failed state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a>. On the most recent Fragile States Index, [[History and development of Nigeria | Nigeria]] ranked 12th out of 179 countries, just behind [[Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and regional tensions | Ethiopia]], which is experiencing a civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:33:00">[12:33:00]</a>. With few signs of improvement, and concerns that the [[Security threats and violence in Nigeria | security situation]] could prevent the 2023 presidential elections from taking place, the country continues to face an astounding range of challenges that increasingly call its future into question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:39:00">[12:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>.

Strategic waterways are crucial to international relations, connecting major oceans or seas and significantly shortening shipping routes, thereby reducing time and costs for global trade and providing vital paths for military forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. As such, they are often central to [[role_of_international_actors_and_geopolitical_implications | geopolitical tensions]] as countries vie for influence over them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. Recent events involving the incoming Trump Administration's threats against Panama over the Panama Canal highlight the ongoing strategic importance and potential for conflict surrounding these vital passages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## The Panama Canal: A Case Study in Geopolitical Importance

The Panama Canal, an 82 km (51-mile) waterway located in the Republic of Panama, links the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. It dramatically shortens the 13,000 km (8,000-mile) route around South America, making it essential for international trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

### Unique Value for the United States

The canal holds unique value for the United States, being its largest user and accounting for approximately 60% of the canal's traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. It is crucial for transporting agricultural products, industrial goods, and energy supplies, and provides a vital passage for the US Navy to move between the East and West Coasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. This makes it economically and militarily essential for the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

### Historical Context of the Canal

The idea of a waterway across the Isthmus of Panama was recognized for centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. Panama itself was a critical part of the Spanish Empire from the early 16th century, serving as an essential trade route for gold and silver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. In 1821, Panama broke free from Spanish rule, becoming part of Gran Colombia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. While Gran Colombia later collapsed, Panama remained under Colombian rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

Serious efforts to build a canal began after the construction of the Suez Canal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. French engineer Ferdinand de Lesseps, who built the Suez Canal, started construction in Panama in 1881 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. However, the project was abandoned in 1889 due to significant engineering challenges, widespread disease, and mismanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.

The United States was keen to continue the project, but Colombia rejected a proposed treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. In response, Washington supported Panamanian rebels seeking independence from Colombia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. On November 3, 1903, a revolt erupted, and the US prevented Colombian intervention, leading to Panama's declaration of independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. Less than two weeks later, on November 18, the US signed a treaty with the new Panamanian administration, granting the US complete control in perpetuity over a 10-mile (15 km) wide zone surrounding the canal in return for guaranteeing Panama's independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. The canal was completed ten years later, in 1914 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.

### Transfer of Control and Renewed Tensions

While the canal's completion was a turning point for global trade, resentment grew among Panamanians due to significant US influence over the country's internal affairs and the Canal Zone's special privileges and wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. Protests erupted in 1964 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. Recognizing the damage to US interests, President Jimmy Carter opened negotiations on the canal's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.

On September 7, 1977, the United States and Panama signed an agreement for Panama to gain complete control of the canal on December 31, 1999, following a period of joint administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. The agreement stipulated the canal would remain neutral territory, allowing ships from all countries, including military vessels, to use it freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>. Crucially, it included a clause allowing the US to intervene militarily to protect the canal's neutrality if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>. Many US conservatives opposed the transfer, fearing a surrender of vital US interests and Panama's instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>. These fears were seemingly confirmed when General Manuel Noriega's control led to Panama becoming a corrupt state and a hub for drug trafficking, resulting in a US invasion in December 1989 to overthrow him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>. Despite this, the handover proceeded as planned on New Year's Eve 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>.

### Recent Geopolitical Friction

Since the handover, Panama's position as a global trade hub has grown, enhanced by a 2016 expansion project that increased the canal's capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>. However, tensions with the United States have emerged over the past decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>. Concerns include:
*   **Corruption and lack of transparency**: Highlighted by the "Panama Papers" scandal, which revealed Panamanian entities facilitating worldwide tax evasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>.
*   **Increasing transit fees**: Panama has raised tolls due to rising maintenance costs, the canal expansion, and [[resource_conflicts_over_water | climate change]] issues like reduced rainfall affecting water levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>. This has disproportionately affected US shipping and led to complaints from US businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>.
*   **China's increasing influence**: In 2017, Panama switched its diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to the People's Republic of China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>. Since then, China has invested significantly in Panama, funding and building ports and other canal-related infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>. This has led to US concerns that Beijing may exert too much control over Panama and the strategically vital waterway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>. These concerns echo broader [[role_of_international_actors_and_geopolitical_implications | geopolitical implications]] related to China's growing influence.

These factors have led to renewed calls in some US circles for the United States to retake control of the canal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>.

### Trump Administration and the Panama Canal

On December 21, 2024, President-elect Donald Trump posted a message on social media threatening Panama over its management of the waterway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. He emphasized the canal's vital importance to the US, its economic and human costs of construction, and insisted Panama should administer it solely without relying on others like China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a>. He also condemned transit fees as a "ripoff" that should stop immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>.

Panama's president, Jose R. Molino, quickly responded, stating that every square meter of the Panama Canal and its adjacent zone belongs to Panama and will remain so, emphasizing that "The sovereignty and independence of our country are not negotiable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>. Trump shot back with posts like "We'll see about that" and an image of a US flag over water captioned "Welcome to the United States Canal!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>.

### Potential Paths Forward

While the aggressive tone has raised worries about potential military action, observers deem it unlikely given Trump's tendency to shy away from overseas conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>. However, as an issue affecting US economic and commercial interests, it may be perceived differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>. Any aggressive moves to reclaim the canal would likely face significant international opposition and violate international law, as the 1977 treaty does not allow for unilateral military action to reclaim control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>.

Instead, the incoming administration has several other avenues to address its concerns:
*   **Diplomatic negotiations**: To discuss fees and limit external influence, although recent exchanges have soured relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>.
*   **Judicial solution**: Such as arbitration or mediation by a third party, explicitly allowed by Article 14 of the 1977 treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:00">[11:48:00]</a>.
*   **Economic measures**: The administration could introduce sanctions or offer economic incentives to influence Panama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a>.

The future of this surprising spat, over an issue many considered settled, remains a significant question regarding the effects of a second Trump term on global politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:00">[12:27:00]</a>.

In April 2023, fierce fighting erupted in Sudan, raising fears that the country had been plunged into yet another civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Unlike previous conflicts, this one is centered on [[factions_within_sudans_military_and_power_struggles | competing factions within the country's military]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Sudan has a history of long-running conflicts that have profoundly shaped and militarized its society, often leading the army or paramilitary bodies to become significant players and even take over politics and decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Geography and Demographics

The Republic of Sudan is located in Northeast Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. It is the world's 15th largest country and the third largest state in Africa, covering 1.8 million square kilometers (720,000 square miles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

It shares borders with:
*   Egypt to the north <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>
*   The Red Sea and Eritrea to the east <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>
*   [[ethiopian_political_history_and_conflicts | Ethiopia]] and South Sudan to the south <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>
*   The Central African Republic, Chad, and Libya to the west <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>

Sudan has an estimated population of 46 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. While 97% of Sudanese adhere to Sunni Islam, the country is ethnically mixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Approximately 70% are Arab, and Sudan is a member of the Arab League, but other groups include the Fur, Baja, and Nubians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Historical Background

Sudan has an exceptionally long history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Ancient Period**: Partially conquered by ancient Egypt, the area converted to Christianity in the 6th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Muslim Arab forces attempted to push into the region in the 7th century but were initially repelled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. By the 17th century, Arab and Islamic encroachment grew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
*   **19th Century and Colonial Rule**: At the start of the 19th century, the Ottoman Empire, with an Egyptian Army, established control over the area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. In 1881, a local Islamic leader launched an uprising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Fearing its spread into Egypt and potential destabilization of Anglo-French colonial power, Britain sent troops, bringing Sudan under British rule while Egypt formally remained the sovereign power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

### The North-South Divide
Under colonial rule, Sudan was effectively two very different territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. The northern provinces, comprising about three-quarters of the population, were overwhelmingly Arab and Muslim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. The southern provinces consisted of various sub-Saharan African groups practicing local religions and Christianity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## Post-Independence Conflicts

### First Sudanese Civil War (1955-1972)
Following World War II and the onset of decolonization, Sudan's future became uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Southern leaders sought a federal arrangement within an independent, united Sudan, or their own independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Growing tensions escalated in July 1955 with rioting and a mutiny by Southern soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Britain hastily withdrew, and on January 1, 1956, Sudan became independent but was immediately plunged into [[sudan_civil_war_and_humanitarian_crisis | civil war]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
A peace agreement was reached in 1972, granting the South extensive autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

### Second Sudanese Civil War (1983-2005)
The 1972 peace lasted only a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. Following the discovery of oil along the North-South boundary and growing Islamic sentiment in the North, President Jafaar Nimeiry (who took power in a 1969 military coup) broke the agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. In 1983, he declared Sudan a unitary Islamic state under Sharia law, sparking the Second [[sudan_civil_war_and_humanitarian_crisis | Sudanese Civil War]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
The South was better prepared this time, with the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), supported by neighboring [[ethiopian_political_history_and_conflicts | Ethiopia]], quickly gaining control of Southern rural areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Nimeiry was overthrown in 1985 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. A civilian government failed to make headway, and in 1989, it was overthrown by a military coup led by Omar al-Bashir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
Despite the fall of the [[ethiopian_political_history_and_conflicts | Ethiopian military dictatorship]] in 1991, which deprived the SPLA of crucial support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, South Sudanese forces held on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. By the turn of the millennium, 20 years of fighting had left over 2 million dead from war, disease, and hunger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. The conflict became increasingly costly for the North financially, politically, and diplomatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

### Darfur Conflict (2003 onwards)
A significant new uprising emerged in the western region of Darfur, sparked by growing resentment against Arab domination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. The military launched a brutal campaign, supported by a local Arab militia called the Janjaweed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. This led to accusations of genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

### Peace Agreements and South Sudan's Independence
Confronted with two major uprisings and growing international condemnation, al-Bashir agreed to US-led talks with the South <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. In January 2005, a peace deal was reached, envisioning self-government followed by an independence referendum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Six years later, in July 2011, South Sudan became a sovereign state after over half a century of war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

Efforts were also made to stop the fighting in Darfur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. In 2007, the UN and African Union established a joint peacekeeping force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Tensions continued, and in 2009, al-Bashir was indicted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for crimes against humanity, war crimes, and genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

## Emergence of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF)

Steps were taken to rein in the Janjaweed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. In 2013, the militia became the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and was nominally placed under the command of the armed forces, though with a separate leadership structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. This transformation is crucial for understanding the current situation in Sudan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

## Recent Political Turmoil and the Current Conflict

While South Sudan's independence ended a costly war, it led to other problems for the Sudanese government, which lost crucial oil revenues from the South <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. This loss, combined with reduced spending, fueled widespread anger against the ruling regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

*   **2018-2019 Protests and Al-Bashir's Ouster**: In 2018, mass street protests erupted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. In April 2019, the military stepped in, forcing Omar al-Bashir to resign and placing him under arrest after 30 years in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
*   **Military's Continued Role**: Hopes for democratic civilian rule were short-lived as the Armed Forces made it clear they would remain in charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. This sparked further protests, which were violently suppressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.
*   **Transitional Sovereignty Council**: Following international pressure, the military agreed to share power under a joint Transitional Sovereignty Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. This council included the Armed Forces Commander, General Abdul Fattah al-Burhan, and his deputy, General Mohamad Hamdan Dagalo (commander of the RSF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. However, many Sudanese felt their hopes for democratic government were thwarted, leading to new protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   **2021 Military Coup**: On October 25, 2021, the military leadership staged another coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:09:05]</a>. The Sovereignty Council was dissolved, the prime minister arrested, and power reverted to Burhan and Dagalo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. The takeover was widely condemned, with calls for a return to civilian rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Escalating Power Struggle**: By December 2022, intensive international efforts aimed at a two-year transitional arrangement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. However, a final agreement in April 2023 was thwarted at the last minute by a growing power struggle within the military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
    *   Although the military leadership seemed united in late 2021, the relationship between General al-Burhan and General Dagalo, who knew each other from the Darfur days, became increasingly strained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
    *   Factors included policy differences, personal ambitions, and broader social factors, such as traditional Sudanese elites rejecting Dagalo (a provincial Darfurian) taking control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
    *   Allegations also emerged that Dagalo had built considerable wealth by appropriating gold mines in Darfur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
    *   [[international_implications_and_geopolitical_interests_in_sudan | Geopolitical factors]] also played a part, with Burhan seen as closer to the United States and supported by Egypt, while Dagalo had close links to Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
*   **Outbreak of Fighting**: By early 2023, tensions were open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. Dagalo, with clear political ambitions, publicly campaigned for support, calling the 2021 counter-coup a mistake and painting Burhan as a radical Islamist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. This power struggle erupted on April 15, 2023, with clashes between the Army and the RSF, leading to hundreds killed, thousands wounded, and a mass exodus from the capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

## Current Outlook

The situation remains unclear, with several brokered ceasefires quickly collapsing and little hope for reconciliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. There is a real fear that Sudan is on its way to becoming yet another bloody and protracted [[sudan_civil_war_and_humanitarian_crisis | civil war]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. Many ordinary Sudanese desire both generals out of the picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

The fighting in Sudan has received significant international attention, partly due to thousands of foreigners caught in the conflict and the desperate efforts by countries to evacuate their citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. However, critical [[sudans_strategic_and_economic_significance | geopolitical and economic factors]] are also at play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>:
*   Sudan possesses mineral resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.
*   It is an essential strategic gateway between the Middle East and Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
*   Its Red Sea coastline provides control over one of the world's most crucial waterways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.
*   The alignment of competing generals with different [[international_implications_and_geopolitical_interests_in_sudan | geopolitical actors]] (United States, China, Russia, European Union) adds an extra dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

The outbreak of fighting marks the latest tragic chapter for Sudan, a country that has been in a state of conflict for almost its entire history, giving the military a seemingly permanent place in its politics with disastrous consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has gained a reputation as one of the world's most unstable and dangerous countries, marked by a perpetual cycle of conflict and violence over the last 30 years that has resulted in millions dead and displaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Its history of exploitation, abuse, and conflict is tragic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

## Geographical Context

The Democratic Republic of Congo is situated at the heart of Africa, surrounded by nine countries: Zambia and Angola to its south, the Republic of Congo to its west, the Central African Republic and South Sudan to its north, and Uganda, Burundi, Tanzania, and Rwanda to its east <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. It is the 11th largest country globally and the second largest in Africa after Algeria, covering 2.3 million square kilometers (900,000 square miles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Its population is estimated at around 100 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. In contrast, Rwanda is significantly smaller, at only 26,300 square kilometers (10,200 square miles), making it barely one percent the size of the DRC, and has a population of just 13.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## European Scramble for Africa

The colonial history of the region began in the late 19th century with the European scramble for Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

*   **German Influence**
    Germany established control over what is now Tanzania, Burundi, and Rwanda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

*   **Belgian Rule in Congo**
    Belgium took control of the Congo, initiating a genuinely horrific period of colonial rule marked by atrocities and widespread human rights abuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

### Expansion of Belgian Control

During the First World War, Belgium seized control of the neighboring German territory of Ruanda-Urundi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Unlike the Congo, which remained a Belgian Colony, Ruanda-Urundi was formally administered under a League of Nations mandate and later became a UN trust territory after the Second World War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Despite this, Belgian colonial rule in Ruanda-Urundi was equally brutal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. A "divide and rule" policy was implemented between the main local ethnic groups, the Hutu and the Tutsi, a policy that would have devastating effects upon independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

## Path to Independence

Belgium eventually ended its colonial rule over the region:
*   The Congo gained independence in 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   Two years later, in 1962, Ruanda-Urundi was separated into two states: the Hutu-dominated Republic of Rwanda and the Tutsi-ruled Kingdom of Burundi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## Post-Independence Challenges

All three newly independent countries immediately faced significant problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

### Democratic Republic of Congo

The [[conflict_in_the_democratic_republic_of_congo | Democratic Republic of Congo]] was woefully unprepared for independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. It was immediately plunged into a brutal two-and-a-half-year civil war when the resource-rich province of Katanga attempted, and failed, to secede <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. In 1965, the Congolese government was overthrown by Joseph Mobutu, the army commander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Over the subsequent decades, the country, renamed Zaire in 1971, became increasingly impoverished and corrupt as Mobutu plundered its resources and established a brutal one-party dictatorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

### Rwanda and Burundi

Meanwhile, Rwanda and Burundi also confronted immense challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. In Rwanda, tensions escalated as the Belgian-supported Tutsi regime gave way to the Hutu majority who took control after independence, leading many Tutsi to flee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. In neighboring Burundi, where the Tutsi remained in power, a Hutu-led rebellion in 1972 led to government forces murdering up to 300,000 Hutu in what many describe as a "forgotten genocide" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. These developments would eventually converge in the mid-1990s, leading to broader regional conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

For over three decades, [[eritreas_authoritarian_rule_under_isaias_afwerki | Isaias Afwerki]] has ruled [[eritreas_international_relations_and_foreign_policy | Eritrea]] with an iron grip, transforming it into one of the most secretive and authoritarian countries globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This regime has enforced near-total isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, often leading to it being called "Africa's North Korea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Historical Context and Path to Independence
[[eritreas_history_and_colonial_past | Eritrea's history]] as a state is rooted in the expansion of European colonialism in the 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Italy established the colony of [[eritreas_international_relations_and_foreign_policy | Eritrea]] in 1890 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, later uniting it with [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Ethiopia]] and [[ethiopia_and_somalias_diplomatic_relations | Somaliland]] to form Italian East Africa until the Second World War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

After British troops forced Italy out of the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Ethiopia]] regained independence, while Italian Somaliland eventually became part of the Somali Republic in 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. [[eritreas_international_relations_and_foreign_policy | Eritrea]], however, remained under British administration and became a UN trust territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

The future of [[eritreas_international_relations_and_foreign_policy | Eritrea]] was debated, with the Muslim community favoring independence or continued UN trusteeship, and Christians preferring union with [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Ethiopia]] due to shared religious ties and Emperor Haile Selassie's push for sea access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. In 1952, under pressure from Western-aligned [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Ethiopia]] and with British and American support, [[eritreas_international_relations_and_foreign_policy | Eritrea]] united with [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Ethiopia]] as a federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

This union was unequal, leading to Eritrean discontent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. A revolt launched by the Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF) in 1961 resulted in [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Ethiopia]] dissolving the federation and annexing [[eritreas_international_relations_and_foreign_policy | Eritrea]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. The Eritrean war for independence continued, with Isaias Afwerki's Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF) becoming the dominant faction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the overthrow of [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Ethiopia]]'s Marxist military dictatorship in 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>, [[eritreas_international_relations_and_foreign_policy | Eritrea]] held an independence referendum in 1993, with almost unanimous support for statehood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>, joining the UN a month later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

## Post-Independence Relations and Shift to Isolation
Initially, there were hopes for [[eritreas_international_relations_and_foreign_policy | Eritrea]] to become a modern democracy, with [[international_relations_in_africa | international support]] pouring in and a draft constitution in 1997 enshrining civil liberties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. However, relations soon deteriorated. In 1998, a border dispute led to [[eritreas_international_relations_and_foreign_policy | Eritrea]] invading [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Ethiopia]], sparking a brutal two-year war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

Despite the conflict ending in 2000, continuing tensions with [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Ethiopia]] led to [[eritreas_international_relations_and_foreign_policy | Eritrea]] remaining highly militarized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. [[eritreas_authoritarian_rule_under_isaias_afwerki | Afwerki]] then tightened his grip on power, indefinitely postponing elections and jailing opposition leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. [[eritreas_international_relations_and_foreign_policy | Eritrea]] has since become a totalitarian one-man dictatorship, without a legislature, independent judiciary, or press freedom, severely curtailing human rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. This internal repression has deeply influenced [[eritreas_international_relations_and_foreign_policy | Eritrea]]'s foreign policy.

## Current International Relations and Foreign Policy Stance
[[eritreas_international_relations_and_foreign_policy | Eritrea]] faces considerable [[international_relations_in_africa | international criticism]] for its foreign policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   **Relations with [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Ethiopia]]**: After a peace agreement in 2018 with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>, [[eritreas_international_relations_and_foreign_policy | Eritrea]] sent troops to fight alongside Ethiopian forces in the Tigray civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>, leading to allegations of large-scale war crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. Renewed tensions have emerged, with [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Ethiopia]] suggesting it could invade [[eritreas_international_relations_and_foreign_policy | Eritrea]] to gain Red Sea access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **Regional Accusations**: [[eritreas_international_relations_and_foreign_policy | Eritrea]] has also been accused of arming insurgents in neighboring Sudan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
*   **Allies and Partners**: While largely closed off from the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>, [[eritreas_international_relations_and_foreign_policy | Eritrea]] maintains close contacts with India, a key trading partner and development assistance provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Against the backdrop of tensions with [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Ethiopia]], [[eritreas_authoritarian_rule_under_isaias_afwerki | Afwerki]] has built ties with [[ethiopia_and_somalias_diplomatic_relations | Somalia]] and Egypt, both of whom have differences with Addis Ababa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
*   **International Alignment**: [[eritreas_international_relations_and_foreign_policy | Eritrea]] has become one of Russia's few reliable friends on the world stage, regularly voting alongside Moscow at the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

## External Opposition and Future Outlook
Despite the dire situation, [[eritreas_authoritarian_rule_under_isaias_afwerki | Afwerki]] has faced little organized opposition internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. However, there are signs of growing external opposition. An increasing number of escapees and dissidents are speaking out against [[eritreas_authoritarian_rule_under_isaias_afwerki | Afwerki]]'s rule, detailing human rights abuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. Younger second-generation Eritreans living abroad are becoming more active, leading to bolder opposition groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

Crucially, as tensions with [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Ethiopia]] rise again, [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Ethiopia]] appears to be more closely involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. Two opposition groups, including "Blue Revolution," openly met in Addis Ababa in early 2025 to discuss overthrowing the [[eritreas_authoritarian_rule_under_isaias_afwerki | Afwerki]] regime, an event that would require tacit Ethiopian acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. While [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Ethiopia]] sponsoring an armed insurgency or invading [[eritreas_international_relations_and_foreign_policy | Eritrea]] are considered unlikely due to heavy fortifications and high risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>, the involvement of [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Ethiopia]] remains a critical factor in [[eritreas_international_relations_and_foreign_policy | Eritrea]]'s external dynamics.

The advanced age of [[eritreas_authoritarian_rule_under_isaias_afwerki | Afwerki]] (nearly 80) raises questions about the regime's longevity, especially with no apparent successor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. While the military or ruling elite might attempt to maintain the status quo, others foresee chaos or civil unrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. However, there is currently little evidence to suggest a serious internal threat to the regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. Despite external movements gaining momentum and [[federal_democratic_republic_of_ethiopia_and_regional_tensions | Ethiopia]]'s increased involvement, removing [[eritreas_authoritarian_rule_under_isaias_afwerki | Isaias Afwerki]] from power remains a formidable challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.

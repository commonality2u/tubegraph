Mozambique, located in southeast Africa, has an economy that has seen growth but remains one of the poorest globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:71">[04:51:71]</a>. Its economy is predominantly agricultural <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:29">[04:25:29]</a>.

## Economic Development and Challenges

Following the end of its civil war in 1992, and despite occasional tensions including a renewed RENAMO insurgency between 2013 and 2019, Mozambique began to develop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:95">[04:13:95]</a>. The economy grew on the back of the country's natural resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:81">[04:26:81]</a>. Over the past 30 years, this has led to steady economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:75">[04:46:75]</a>. However, Mozambique still remains one of the poorest countries in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:71">[04:51:71]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:30">[09:51:30]</a>.

The [[islamic_insurgency_in_mozambique | insurgency]] in the northern province of Cabo Delgado has had a devastating effect on efforts to build the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:32">[09:47:32]</a>.

## Natural Resource Wealth

Mozambique possesses significant natural resources:
*   **Minerals** The country holds large deposits of iron ore, gold, nickel, platinum, and bauxite (used to make aluminium) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:84">[04:30:84]</a>.
*   **Natural Gas** Significant natural gas deposits were discovered off Mozambique's northern coast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:78">[04:37:78]</a>. These discoveries led to major investments by international energy firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:32">[04:43:32]</a>. The province of Cabo Delgado is considered the heart of natural gas production in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:86">[07:31:86]</a>.

## Impact of Resources on Conflict

Despite the natural gas discoveries, Cabo Delgado remains the poorest of Mozambique's provinces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:35">[05:12:35]</a>. This combination of underdevelopment and resentment that natural wealth is not benefiting the local population has provided fertile ground for recruitment to extremist causes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:81">[05:17:81]</a>. The economic gains from natural gas are now being put at risk by the major [[islamic_insurgency_in_mozambique | insurgency]] centered in Cabo Delgado <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:92">[04:55:92]</a>.

In March 2021, militants launched a major attack on the port town of Palma, which is central to natural gas production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:70">[07:25:70]</a>. A multi-billion dollar natural gas plant being built by the French energy company Total was also targeted, resulting in deaths of local and foreign contractors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:30">[07:42:30]</a>. Weeks after the attack, Total announced it was suspending its operations in Mozambique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:30">[07:57:30]</a>.

## Future Outlook

While there is a growing military response to the crisis, any long-term solution will need to focus on economic aspects, including issues of economic underdevelopment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:69">[10:39:69]</a>. The exploitation of natural gas, which was one of the best hopes for addressing the situation, has now been hindered by the [[islamic_insurgency_in_mozambique | insurgency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:47">[10:48:47]</a>. Mozambique appears to be locked into a "vicious circle of underdevelopment begetting violence begetting under development" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:34">[10:58:34]</a>.

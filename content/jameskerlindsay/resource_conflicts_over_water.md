Natural resources are widely recognized as a significant source of tension and conflict in modern international relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. While disputes commonly arise over energy resources like oil and gas, or precious metals and minerals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, access to fresh water is another crucial area of competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Water is vital for drinking, sanitation, agriculture, and energy production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. As climate change impacts global water supplies, it is expected to become an increasing source of instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

One of the world's most critical water access disputes is unfolding in Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, specifically between Ethiopia and Egypt over the Nile River <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## The Nile River: A Vital Resource

The Nile River, approximately 6,700 kilometers (4,000 miles) long, is Africa's longest river <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. It comprises two main tributaries:
*   **The White Nile** Originates in the Great Lakes region of central Africa, near Rwanda, Kenya, and Tanzania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   **The Blue Nile** Starts in Ethiopia and joins the White Nile in Sudan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

For Egypt, the Nile is an indispensable natural resource, providing almost 98% of the country's drinking water and virtually all water needed for agriculture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Egypt is highly sensitive to any disruptions to the river's flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

Ethiopia also views the Nile as essential. With most of its population relying on farming, it has significant water needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Furthermore, as one of Africa's fastest-growing economies, Ethiopia faces massive growth in energy demand, with nearly half its population lacking access to electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. The Ethiopian government has long recognized the Blue Nile's potential for hydroelectric power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

## The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD)

The decision to harness the Blue Nile for hydroelectric power has led to the current [[ethiopiaegypt_water_dispute | tensions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
Historically, Egypt has been concerned about Ethiopia building a dam on the Nile, even threatening war in the 1970s if such a project proceeded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Former Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak reportedly suggested bombing any new dam on the river <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

The situation changed dramatically in 2011 with the Arab Spring and Mubarak's removal from power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Seizing the opportunity, Ethiopia proceeded with constructing the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

> [!INFO] GERD Specifications
> The GERD is located less than 30 kilometers from the border with Sudan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a> and is estimated to cost over 4.5 billion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. Standing almost 150 meters high, its reservoir will contain 74 billion cubic meters of water and cover an area of 1,900 square kilometers (720 square miles) when filled after 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. It is set to become Africa's largest hydropower project and one of the largest globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

The dam has become a symbol of Ethiopia's growing ambitions and a means to lift millions of its citizens out of poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

## Rising Tensions and Failed Diplomacy

The initiation of the GERD project led to severe [[tensions_and_potential_conflict_in_the_horn_of_africa | tensions]] with both Sudan and Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. While Sudan initially opposed the project, it later shifted its position, seeing potential for extra electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Egypt, however, adopted a much stronger stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. While not objecting to Ethiopia's development goals, Cairo insisted that the project must consider the legitimate interests of other affected countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

Early attempts at agreement:
*   **2015 Declaration of Principles** The sides signed a declaration of principles, initially hailed as a significant step towards a comprehensive settlement, but little came from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   **Growing Accusations** By 2016, Ethiopia openly accused Egypt of supporting separatist groups, a claim Egypt vehemently denied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   **Brief Rapprochement** In June 2018, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abi Ahmed Ali met amicably with Egyptian leader Abdul Fatah El Sisi in Cairo, expressing willingness to agree on the dam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Abi Ahmed insisted Ethiopia would never hurt the people of Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
*   **Renewed Hostility** Hopes for a breakthrough were short-lived, and by late 2019, relations had completely broken down, with Abi Ahmed threatening war if Egypt acted against the dam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.
*   **African Union Mediation** In July 2020, African Union mediation led to a "major common understanding" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. However, key elements remained unresolved, including water release during severe droughts and mechanisms for handling disagreements, particularly Ethiopia's rejection of binding arbitration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

## Current Situation and Outlook

Since 2020, little further progress has been made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. Egypt has adopted a tougher stance, with its foreign minister stating in 2021 that "more than a hundred million Egyptians face an existential threat" from the dam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

> [!WARNING] International Concern
> The seriousness of the issue has drawn international attention. The UN Security Council discussed the matter in 2020 and 2021, issuing a presidential statement calling for negotiations under African Union auspices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

Despite calls for diplomacy, [[tensions_and_potential_conflict_in_the_horn_of_africa | tensions]] continue to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. Ethiopia has begun filling the dam, a move Egypt condemned to the Security Council in July 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. Egypt has also accused Ethiopia of obstructing talks and has sought to raise the issue in other international forums, such as the African Union Summit in February 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

Egypt repeatedly emphasizes that it cannot tolerate such a fundamental challenge to its interests, arguing that without an agreement, the project threatens international peace and security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. For these reasons, the GERD is widely viewed as one of Africa's most serious potential flashpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

### Potential Solutions
A new study based on computer modeling suggests an optimal outcome exists that could address the concerns of all three countries (Ethiopia, Egypt, and Sudan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. However, there is little indication that the nations are currently willing to discuss this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.

While a full-scale war might seem unlikely, as the dam continues to fill and is expected to be fully operational in 2024, the issue still carries the risk of sparking a conflict between two of Africa's largest, oldest, and most influential countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

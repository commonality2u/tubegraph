The Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 has been widely condemned, sparking discussions about whether it represents an unprecedented challenge to the modern system of international relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. While Russia's actions are distinct in their comprehensive violation of core international principles, it is also argued that Western states have contributed to the erosion of these very rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32">[11:32]</a>.

## Core Principles of International Relations

International politics is underpinned by three interlinked principles: sovereignty, territorial integrity, and political independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46">[01:46]</a>.

*   **Sovereignty**: This is the universally understood right of countries to determine what happens within their borders, a principle foundational to modern statehood since the 17th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19">[02:19]</a>. It is enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52">[02:52]</a>. All invasions by one state against another inherently violate sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56">[02:56]</a>.
*   **Territorial Integrity**: This principle, also enshrined in the UN Charter, means states must respect one another's defined physical boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35">[03:35]</a>. Wars of territorial conquest where a country seeks to claim another's territory as its own have been rare in modern times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10">[04:10]</a>.
*   **Political Independence**: Also explicitly stated in the UN Charter, this refers to the existence of a state as a sovereign entity and the extent to which it controls decisions made within its borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33">[06:33]</a>. Invasions aimed at formal extinction of a state are rare, and international law no longer accepts conquest as a legitimate basis for state extinction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51">[06:51]</a>.

## Western Actions and Rule Erosion

While Russia's invasion of Ukraine is seen as an unprecedented challenge because it violates all three of these fundamental principles simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00">[02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14">[09:14]</a>, Western states have engaged in actions that, from a detached perspective, have also contributed to the erosion of these rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32">[11:32]</a>.

### Violations of Sovereignty

All invasions, by definition, violate a country's sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02">[03:02]</a>. This applies to Western interventions such as the US-led invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10">[01:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14">[03:14]</a>.

### Violations of Territorial Integrity

*   **NATO Campaign against Yugoslavia (1999)**: The NATO bombing campaign, while not aiming for annexation by protagonists, eventually led to Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57">[04:57]</a>. This outcome violated Serbia's territorial integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04">[05:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36">[05:36]</a>.
*   **US-led Invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan**: Crucially, these interventions did not result in any border changes, and both countries preserved their territorial integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30">[04:30]</a>.

### Violations of Political Independence (Regime Change)

The concept of political independence can be challenged when invasions aim for regime change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06">[08:06]</a>.

*   **US-led Invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq**: The United States and its partners sought to remove the Taliban from Afghanistan and Saddam Hussein from Iraq <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15">[08:15]</a>. These actions amounted to a violation of both countries' respective political independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20">[08:20]</a>.
*   **NATO Campaign against Yugoslavia**: Regime change was not a goal for NATO in Yugoslavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35">[08:35]</a>.

### The Western Contribution to Rule Erosion

While the reasons for Western interventions, such as creating democratic states or stopping human rights abuses, may have been considered strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44">[11:44]</a>, from a detached perspective, these actions set a precedent. Other countries will inevitably justify their violations on similar grounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:56">[11:56]</a>.

The fundamental rules of the international system, which dictate how countries understand the limits of their behavior towards one another, have been in place for over 70 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57">[09:57]</a>. If states believe that these rules do not apply to them or can be broken by others, they will behave accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26">[11:26]</a>. The argument suggests that Western states must accept that the current state of international relations, where rules are being challenged, is partly a result of their own contributions to eroding those rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32">[11:32]</a>.

Although Russia's actions in Ukraine represent a far more extensive breach of international norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02">[12:02]</a>, the overall system of global politics, built up over 70 years, has been gradually undermined, potentially leading to a return to a "might makes right" approach to international affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11">[12:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20">[12:20]</a>.

The [[moldovatransnistria_relations | Transnistria issue]] is a long-standing dispute concerning a breakaway region at the eastern edge of Moldova <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. The [[impact_of_the_ukraine_war_on_transnistria | ongoing war in Ukraine]] has brought increased attention to Moldova and Transnistria, with suggestions that Transnistria could be a target for Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This has raised important questions about the future of Transnistria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Geographical and Demographic Overview

**Moldova**
Moldova is located in southeast Europe, situated between Romania and Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   **Size**: 34,000 square kilometres (13,000 square miles), making it the 134th largest member of the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   **Population**: Approximately 2.6 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   **Ethnic Composition**: Primarily composed of Romanian-speaking Moldovans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Ukrainians constitute about seven percent of the population, and Russians make up around four percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. By 1989, Romanian-speaking Moldovans represented roughly two-thirds of the population, with Ukrainians and Russians each accounting for about 13 percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

**Transnistria (Trans-Dniester)**
Transnistria lies at Moldova's eastern edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Size**: 4,200 square kilometres (1,600 square miles), which is slightly more than 10 percent of Moldova's total territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   **Population**: According to the 2015 census, its population was 475,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Ethnic Composition**: The population is roughly equally divided among three main ethnic groups: Russians (29%), Moldovans (29%), and Ukrainians (23%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## [[historical_context_of_moldova_and_transnistria | Historical Context of Moldova and Transnistria]]

Moldova's origins trace back to the Principality of Moldavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   **1812**: The Ottoman Empire ceded Moldavia's eastern provinces, known as Bessarabia, to Imperial Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   **1881**: Western Moldavia united with Wallachia to form the Kingdom of Romania, but Bessarabia remained under Russian rule until 1917 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Post-Russian Revolution (1917-1918)**: Local leaders in Bessarabia declared independence and subsequently united with Romania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   **Soviet Union's Stance**: The newly established Soviet Union never accepted this unification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **1924**: The Soviet Union created the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic within Soviet Ukraine, located on the east bank of the Dniester River. This Slavic area, Trans-Dniester, was not traditionally considered part of Romanian-speaking Bessarabia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **World War II**: On August 2, 1940, after seizing Bessarabia, the Soviet Union merged Bessarabia and Trans-Dniester to form the Moldovan Soviet Socialist Republic, one of the 15 top-level republics of the USSR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Over subsequent decades, Moscow altered the demographic balance in the republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## Conflict and Russian Intervention

As the Soviet Union weakened, Moldovan leaders began to reassert their Romanian-Moldovan identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. This led to tensions with Transnistria, where the predominantly Slavic population maintained closer ties to Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

*   **1991 Independence Declaration**: In August 1991, with the collapse of the Soviet Union, Transnistria unilaterally declared independence, forming the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   **1992 Conflict**: On March 2, 1992, the same day the now independent Republic of Moldova joined the UN, significant fighting erupted between Moldovan troops and Transnistrian forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   **[[russian_influence_and_military_presence_in_transnistria | Russian Intervention]]**: The Russian army stationed in Transnistria intervened to defend the breakaway republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. After four and a half months of conflict and around a thousand deaths, a ceasefire was agreed upon in July 1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   **Continued Russian Presence**: The ceasefire allowed a contingent of Russian troops to remain as part of an agreed peacekeeping force. Russia also maintained a separate contingent of troops in Transnistria, which remains there to this day, despite calls from the UN General Assembly for their withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
*   **De Facto State**: As a result, Transnistria, although internationally unrecognised (even by Russia), became a de facto state under Moscow's protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

## Geopolitical Significance and Future Prospects

In the years following the conflict, efforts were made to resolve the dispute under the auspices of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Russia, Ukraine, the European Union, and the United States, but a solution proved impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

*   **Moldova's Reluctance**: Moldova was unwilling to grant too much power to Transnistria, particularly if it gave Russia a say in internal Moldovan affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
*   **Transnistria's Stance**: Transnistrian leaders, content with Russian financial support, had no desire to abandon the "criminal statelet" they had created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   **Russian Leverage**: The dispute became a useful bargaining chip for Moscow, effectively blocking Moldova from pursuing European Union and NATO membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

This situation has led to a "frozen conflict" where both sides have been increasingly willing to interact, yet seem comfortable with the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. However, this stability is now threatened by the [[impact_of_the_ukraine_war_on_transnistria | war in Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

### [[potential_outcomes_and_solutions_for_the_transnistria_conflict | Potential Outcomes and Solutions for the Transnistria Conflict]]

The future of Transnistria is heavily influenced by the developments in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

#### Russian Invasion and Annexation
The most immediate concern is a potential Russian invasion of Transnistria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
*   **Speculation**: As Russian forces advanced in southern Ukraine, there was speculation they might attempt to link up with the 1,500 Russian troops in Transnistria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This could precede an attack on western Ukraine or an attempt to take control of Moldova <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Russian Intent**: Leaked images from Belarus appeared to show Russian plans to attack Transnistria, and a Russian general claimed this was a war aim, though Russia strongly denied it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Consequences**: If Russia invades, it would almost certainly recognise Transnistria's independence, potentially followed by annexation, similar to Crimea, Donbas, and other areas in southern Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. This would transform Transnistria from a Russian-occupied de facto state into annexed territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
*   **Demographic Shift**: Such a development could profoundly impact Transnistria's population, potentially leading to an exodus of Moldovans and Ukrainians, leaving primarily Russians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
*   **International Status**: Legally, Transnistria would still be considered part of Moldova by the international community, remaining an unresolved conflict, which could leave the door open for a settlement in a post-Putin era, though changes on the ground would become more entrenched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

#### Moldova Retaking Transnistria by Force
Moldova might consider trying to retake Transnistria by force, seeing Russia's preoccupation in Ukraine as an opportune moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.
*   **International Reaction**: There might be little international opposition, given precedents like Azerbaijan's campaign against Nagorno-Karabakh in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   **Unlikely Scenario**: This is highly unlikely as the Moldovan government has publicly committed to a peaceful settlement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   **Military Incapacity**: Moldova's army is small and poorly equipped, despite Russia's forces in Transnistria being relatively weak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.
*   **Risk of Escalation**: Such an action could inflame tensions with Moscow, potentially leading to Russian airstrikes on Moldovan cities and civilian targets if Russia felt it was losing control of Transnistria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
*   **Limited External Help**: Neighbouring Romania, a NATO member, assisted in 1992 but cannot play a direct role this time to avoid a confrontation between Russia and the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

#### Ukraine Launching an Attack
Ukraine might attack Russian forces in Transnistria to secure its southwestern flank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. This could happen if Transnistria prepares to join the attack on Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

#### Negotiated Settlement
Using the current opportunity to push for a negotiated settlement also seems difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   **Obstacles**: Talks are unlikely while the war in Ukraine continues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Transnistrian leaders would not give up their claim to independence while hoping for Russian support, and Russia's military presence would prevent them from acting behind Moscow's back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.
*   **Shift if Russia Weakens**: Things could change if Russia's war efforts falter, making it unable to support Transnistria politically, militarily, or financially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Even then, a deal would be challenging, as Moldova's willingness to offer high autonomy or a federal settlement to a weakened Transnistria is uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

#### Accepting Transnistria's Independence
Some have suggested Moldova might simply accept Transnistria's independence to resolve the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   **Unlikely**: States rarely voluntarily cede territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.
*   **Potential Advantages**: This could end a long dispute and open new options for Moldova, such as easier European Union membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. It could even enable NATO membership (currently prevented by Moldova's constitutional neutrality) or facilitate union with Romania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.
*   **Major Problems**:
    *   **Demographic Concerns**: Roughly a third of Transnistria's population is Moldovan, making it difficult for Moldova to abandon them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.
    *   **Geopolitical Complications**: An independent Transnistria could become another [[russian_influence_and_military_presence_in_transnistria | Russian client state]] between Ukraine and Moldova <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. It might then seek union with Russia, becoming a [[kaliningrad_and_its_geopolitical_significance | Russian exclave]] similar to Kaliningrad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.
    *   **Western Relations**: Given Russia's strong presence, it's unlikely an independent Transnistria would develop closer relations with the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

### The "Frozen Conflict" Status
Despite the tumultuous events in Ukraine, the possibility remains that Transnistria could simply remain a frozen conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. This would mean a continuation of the status quo, albeit within a new geopolitical context of extremely tense relations between Russia and the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.

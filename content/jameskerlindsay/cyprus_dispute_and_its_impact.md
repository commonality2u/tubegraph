The status of Cyprus has been a persistent point of contention between Greece and Turkey, significantly impacting their bilateral relations.

## Historical Context and Independence

Cyprus, initially passed from the Ottomans to British colonial administration in 1878, was formally ceded to Britain under the terms of the Treaty of Lausanne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. Despite pleas from the Greek Cypriot population to unite with Greece, London refused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

In April 1955, an armed campaign was launched by Greek Cypriots to force Britain out and achieve union with Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. This immediately led to tensions between Greece and Turkey, as the Turkish Cypriots, who constituted a fifth of the island's population, advocated for the island's partition between the two countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Anti-Greek rioting subsequently erupted in Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

Fears grew that a civil war in Cyprus could draw in Greece and Turkey, thereby undermining a critical flank of NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. As a compromise, Cyprus became an independent republic in August 1960, based on a power-sharing agreement between its communities, guaranteed by Britain, Greece, and Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Despite this, the events in Cyprus had already undermined relations between Athens and Ankara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

## Escalation and Division

Hopes for a return to good relations were short-lived. In December 1963, the constitutional arrangements in Cyprus broke down, leading to widespread fighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. While a [[United Nations peacekeeping in Cyprus | UN peacekeeping force]] helped ease the immediate situation, tensions persisted between the communities and between Athens and Ankara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

The breaking point occurred a decade later. In July 1974, the military junta then ruling Greece overthrew the Cypriot president in an attempt to secure unification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. Citing its right to protect the constitutional order, Turkey invaded on July 20, seizing control of a third of the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. This division remains a fundamental point of contention between Greece and Turkey to this day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

## Ongoing Impasse and Failed Resolutions

The Cyprus issue has remained a significant obstacle in Greek-Turkish relations.

*   **UN Settlement Plan (2004):** A reunification effort, supported by Turkey, failed in 2004 when Greek Cypriots rejected a UN settlement plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.
*   **Continued Talks (2009 onwards):** Despite the creation of a High-Level Cooperation Council in 2009, outstanding issues, including Cyprus, remained unresolved, with discussions often becoming "talks about talks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
*   **Two-State Solution (Post-2017):** After another attempt to resolve Cyprus failed in the summer of 2017, Ankara began advocating for a two-state solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.

The resolution of the Cyprus dispute is seen as crucial for any lasting improvement in Greek-Turkish relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. Without it, any new attempts at a fresh start are likely to be temporary, lasting only until the next crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.

In early May 2023, widespread violence erupted in the Indian state of [[manipur_ethnic_conflict | Manipur]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This situation has led to over a hundred deaths and displaced tens of thousands of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. While receiving limited international attention, it has highlighted important questions about managing inter-ethnic relations in India, the world's most populous and diverse country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Concepts of Self-Determination

Separatist conflicts are often considered in terms of *external self-determination*, where a group seeks to form its own sovereign state, though this is rarely feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Instead, the focus frequently shifts to *internal self-determination*, which involves seeking a degree of autonomy within a country's existing borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This can involve cultural rights or territorial arrangements, both of which can be sources of conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The situation in [[manipur_ethnic_conflict | Manipur]] serves as a prime example of these challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Manipur: Geography and Demographics

[[manipur_ethnic_conflict | Manipur]] is located in the northeast corner of India, bordering China, Bangladesh, and Burma (Myanmar) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. It is India's 25th largest territorial unit, among its 28 federal states and eight union territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. It neighbors the Indian states of Nagaland, Assam, and Mizoram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

Manipur's population of around 3 million is composed of several key groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>:

*   **Meitei:** Primarily located in the lowland Manipur Valley, which constitutes about 10% of the state's territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. They speak Manipuri, a Sino-Tibetan language, and are predominantly Hindu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Hill Tribes:** Residing in the mountainous 90% of the state surrounding the Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. These include the Naga to the north <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, and the Kuki in the south and central mountainous areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
    *   **Kuki:** Speak languages related to Chinese, Tibetan, and Burmese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Unlike the Meitei, most Kuki are Christian or follow local animist religions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. They are part of a larger tribal group connected to the Mizo, extending into neighboring Indian states, Bangladesh, and Burma (where they are known as the Chin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

## Historical Context of Manipur

Manipur has a long history, becoming an independent kingdom before the rise of British rule in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. In 1762, the local ruler allied with the British East India Company for defense against the Burmans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Britain continued to protect Manipur as a dependent state, formally taking control in 1891 following a dynastic dispute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Manipur became one of the 700 princely states within British India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

Despite being a single political entity, Manipur was already divided into the Meitei-controlled Valley and the hill tribe areas of the Naga and Kuki <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Relations between the British and Kuki were strained even before 1891, with Kuki-dominated regions often mutinous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Efforts to convert Kuki to Christianity in the early 20th century saw some success, but tensions persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. In 1917, the Kuki launched an uprising for self-rule, which was suppressed by 1919 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. The Kuki quest for a homeland continued, even as Manipur became a frontline during World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

### Post-Independence Integration

After India's partition in 1947, princely states could join India, Pakistan, or become independent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Manipur initially became a separate kingdom but merged with the Dominion of India on October 15, 1949 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. Its status evolved from central government control to a union territory in 1956, and finally to a full state of India with internal autonomy on January 21, 1972 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

### Tribal Privileges and Growing Tensions

Upon joining India, the Kuki and other Hill Tribes received special privileges under the 'scheduled tribe' stipulation in the Indian constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. These included preferential treatment in government jobs and restrictions on non-tribal members buying land in their areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. Despite these protections, many Kuki were unhappy with Manipur's integration, arguing it was coerced, and sought to unite Kuki-held territories into an independent state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

Tensions escalated between the Kuki and Meitei, and also between the Kuki and Naga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. In 1980, the Indian government designated Manipur a "disturbed area," granting the Army significant powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. This period saw the rise of militant groups, including the Kuki National Organization (KNO) and its armed wing, the Kuki National Army (KNA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

## Recent Developments and Renewed Conflict

Most fighting halted in 2008 with the Suspension of Operations (SoO) agreement between Kuki groups, the Manipur State Administration, and the Indian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. This agreement, renewed annually, required Kuki militants to withdraw to designated camps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. While ending calls for an independent Kuki state, it did not stop demands for internal boundary changes, such as a new Kuki federal state or union territory within India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. These aspirations were boosted by the creation of Telangana in 2014, India's first new federal state since 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

### Spark of the Latest Violence

The latest violence in [[manipur_ethnic_conflict | Manipur]] stems from two key developments in March 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>:

1.  **Non-renewal of SoO Agreement:** The Manipur government announced it would not renew the Suspension of Operations agreement, citing reports of Kuki militant unrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:10:01]</a>.
2.  **Meitei's Scheduled Tribe Status Request:** The Manipur High Court ruled for the state administration to petition the Indian government to grant the Meitei scheduled tribe status alongside the hill tribes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

This second point triggered riots, as Kuki feared it would reduce their government job quotas and allow Meitei to buy land in their areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. The violence escalated, with villages on both sides attacked and burned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. Accusations arose against both the Manipur state government and the Indian government for failing to ensure peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. The Indian government claims to be taking steps to quell the violence, including a visit by the Home Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

The conflict has led to an exodus of Kuki from Meitei areas, with many fleeing to the Kuki city of Churachandpur, refugee camps, and neighboring states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

## Political Implications and Future Outlook

The collapse in inter-ethnic relations has re-energized calls for a separate Kuki federal state or territorial unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. All 10 Kuki members of the 60-member Manipur State Legislature, including those from India's ruling BJP party, have endorsed this view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.

However, the creation of a separate unit seems unlikely for now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. Manipur's Chief Minister, N. Biren Singh, vehemently opposes the division of the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. The national government also shows no indication of considering a change in status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.

There are fears that this deadlock could lead to a new cycle of sustained violence and a return to a full-scale armed militant campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. India wishes to avoid this, especially given growing tensions with China and the fallout from Burma's escalating civil war across the border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. Some argue that developments in neighboring Burma are influencing the violence in [[manipur_ethnic_conflict | Manipur]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.

Even if calm is restored and the current constitutional structure is maintained, many believe lasting damage has been done to inter-ethnic relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. This will likely strengthen the estrangement between the Kuki and the Meitei, ensuring that [[manipur_ethnic_conflict | Manipur]] remains heavily divided, as it has been for much of its modern history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

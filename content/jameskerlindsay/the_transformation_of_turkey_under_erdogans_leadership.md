On 14 May 2023, Turkey is set to hold what many consider to be one of the most critical elections in its history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For two decades, [[recep_tayyip_erdogans_political_strategy_and_future | Recep Tayyip Erdogan]] has been the dominant figure in Turkish politics, profoundly transforming the country and its global standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This transformation, however, has increasingly led Turkey in a troubling direction, marked by growing authoritarianism internally and externally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Historical Context of Turkey

Turkey, now officially known as T端rkiye, is located in the Eastern Mediterranean at the intersection of Europe and Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. It is the 36th largest country globally by land area, with a population of approximately 85 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. While the majority are ethnic Turks, significant minority groups exist, with Kurds comprising 10 to 20 percent of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Although predominantly Sunni Muslim, Turkey also has smaller non-Muslim communities, including Greeks, Jews, and Armenians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Its per capita GDP of around US$9,700 categorizes it as a middle-income country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

Modern Turkey's history dates back to the Ottoman Empire, which emerged in the 12th century and by the 18th century dominated Southeast Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. The Empire faced a steep decline by the early 20th century, particularly after siding with Germany in the First World War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Turkish nationalist forces, led by Mustafa Kemal (later Atat端rk), fought back, leading to the establishment of the Republic of Turkey in 1923 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

As Turkey's first president, Atat端rk instituted widespread economic, political, and social reforms to modernize the country and align it with Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. These reforms included introducing surnames, replacing the Ottoman Arab script with the Roman alphabet, and, controversially, rolling back Islam's influence in society by establishing a strict separation of religion and state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. By his death in 1938, Atat端rk had completely transformed Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

In the following decades, Turkey continued its Western orientation, joining NATO in 1952 and becoming a strategically vital alliance member due to its unique non-arctic route into the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. However, internal problems emerged, with the military gaining significant influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This culminated in a 1960 military coup that overthrew and executed the prime minister, accused of undermining the Constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Civilian control was restored, but instability, marked by political violence, persisted through the 1970s, leading to another military takeover in 1980 for three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

By the 1990s, despite a return to civilian democracy, Turkey was plagued by deep divisions between mainstream political parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. New [[challenges_and_controversies_during_erdogans_governance | challenges]] arose, including a major Kurdish separatist insurgency in the Southeast and the entry of Islam into mainstream politics despite military opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. It was into this environment that [[erdogans_rise_to_power_and_political_career | Recep Tayyip Erdogan emerged]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

## Erdogan's Emergence and Early Rule

Born on February 26, 1954, in Istanbul, [[erdogans_rise_to_power_and_political_career | Erdogan]] spent his youth on the Black Sea coast before returning to Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. He attended an Islamic school and became involved in politics as a student, joining a religious party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Over subsequent decades, he ascended the political ladder, becoming the mayor of Istanbul in 1994 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. His religious beliefs led to his jailing for four months in 1998 for reciting a poem deemed a call to religious violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Despite this, he continued his political career, becoming the head of the new Justice and Development Party (AKP) in 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

In November 2002, following an economic and constitutional crisis, the AKP won a landslide victory in the general election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Though initially unable to stand for Parliament due to his prior conviction, the new government swiftly overturned the ban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. [[erdogans_rise_to_power_and_political_career | Erdogan]] was elected as an MP and became prime minister on March 14, 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

Initially, many questioned his motives, fearing he would pursue an overtly religious agenda and isolate Turkey from the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. However, [[erdogans_policies_and_influence | Erdogan]] appeared to defy sceptics by prioritizing European Union membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. To this end, he focused on improving relations with Greece and resolving the Cyprus division, both obstacles to Turkish accession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. In 2005, Turkey formally began accession talks with the EU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

### Initial Reforms and Liberalization

The prospect of EU accession spurred significant [[erdogans_policies_and_influence | changes]] in Turkey during Erdogan's first few years in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Steps were taken to liberalize society, including easing restrictions on religion in public life, such as allowing women to wear headscarves in government offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. Crucially, his [[erdogans_policies_and_influence | administration]] also introduced significant new minority rights, including Kurdish language education, and reined in the military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

## Shift Towards Authoritarianism

Despite these initial positive transformations, concerns about [[erdogans_political_strategies_and_authoritarianism | Erdogan's true intentions]] began to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. After the AKP secured another overwhelming victory in 2007, seemingly defeating all internal opposition, the 2011 elections were marred by allegations of electoral fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

The real turning point occurred in May 2013, when police violently dispersed protesters attempting to block a park development in central Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. This minor protest escalated into widespread nationwide demonstrations and violent clashes involving hundreds of thousands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Though the government suppressed the unrest, [[erdogans_political_strategies_and_authoritarianism | Erdogan]] responded by clamping down on opposition and becoming increasingly autocratic, rather than adopting a conciliatory approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

In 2014, [[erdogans_political_strategies_and_authoritarianism | Erdogan]] ran for and won the presidency, a role previously largely ceremonial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. He then appointed a compliant prime minister, effectively consolidating his control over Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

### The 2016 Coup Attempt and Aftermath

Beneath the surface of seemingly complete control, discontent was brewing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. This came to international attention on July 15, 2016, when elements within the military attempted a coup, which quickly collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. In response, the government launched a massive crackdown, blaming a dissident religious leader and jailing thousands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Anyone suspected of opposing the AKP was purged from positions in the civil service, military, judiciary, and higher education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

This period saw [[erdogans_political_strategies_and_authoritarianism | Erdogan]] further consolidate his power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. In 2017, he introduced constitutional changes, later approved by referendum, that abolished the prime minister post and created an executive presidency, similar to the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

## Current State and Global Position

Since 2017, [[erdogans_administration_and_changing_political_outlook | concerns about Turkey]] have continued to escalate, both domestically and internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. Internally, Turkey has become a profoundly illiberal state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>:
*   The media is heavily controlled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
*   Human rights abuses are rampant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   There are serious worries about the democratic system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   The economy is in disarray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
*   Persistent allegations of high-level corruption exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

[[erdogans_political_strategies_and_authoritarianism | Erdogan's increasingly autocratic rule]] has been characterized by growing megalomania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. This is evident in his decision to build a massive presidential palace in Ankara, legislation making insulting the president a criminal offense, and the renaming of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

On foreign policy, [[erdogans_impact_on_turkish_domestic_and_foreign_policy | Erdogan]] has steered Turkey further away from the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. His authoritarianism has effectively ended any hope for Turkish EU membership, with talks halted for the past decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. There are also concerns about Turkey's reliability as a NATO ally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. While attempting to establish Turkey as an international actor by building ties across the Balkans, Africa, and Central Asia, [[erdogans_impact_on_turkish_domestic_and_foreign_policy | Erdogan]] has developed a contentious relationship with Vladimir Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. This includes purchasing a Russian-made anti-aircraft missile system, to the annoyance of the United States, and taking an ambivalent stance on Ukraine, continuing trade with Russia despite NATO partners imposing sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

This overall picture is of a Turkey led by an authoritarian leader increasingly isolated from Turkish society and its traditional partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

## The Upcoming Election and Erdogan's Legacy

The upcoming presidential and parliamentary elections on May 14 are seen by many as the best opportunity to unseat [[recep_tayyip_erdogans_political_strategy_and_future | Erdogan]] and reverse the constitutional reforms that centralized power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. Although his poll ratings have declined, particularly after the devastating 2023 earthquake and accusations of government failure, the election remains tight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. A coalition of six opposition parties aims to unseat him, but appears divided, and other candidates refusing to join may split the vote, potentially allowing [[recep_tayyip_erdogans_political_strategy_and_future | Erdogan]] to remain in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

The [[recep_tayyip_erdogans_political_strategy_and_future | Erdogan era's legacy]] is complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. It's easy to forget the political chaos and illiberal democracy that engulfed Turkey before his ascent, marked by infighting and heavy restrictions on human and minority rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. For about his first decade in power, [[erdogans_policies_and_influence | Erdogan]] did move Turkey in a broadly positive direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. He attempted to resolve the Cyprus issue, introduced significant domestic political and social reforms, and opened talks with the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.

However, one cannot overlook the [[erdogans_political_strategies_and_authoritarianism | troubling course Turkey has taken]] in his second decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. This period has seen the country move in a genuinely worrying direction, both internally and externally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. There have even been calls for Turkey to be removed from NATO, as few in the West now consider it a reliable ally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. Regardless of the challenges of the pre-Erdogan past or the uncertainties of a post-Erdogan future, [[recep_tayyip_erdogans_political_strategy_and_future | Recep Tayyip Erdogan]] has utterly transformed Turkey, initially for the better, and more recently for the worse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.

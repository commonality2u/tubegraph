In November 2022, leaders of the [[Organization of Turkic States summit in Uzbekistan 2022 | Organization of Turkic States]] convened in Uzbekistan, signaling a potential shift in regional dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This meeting occurs as Russia's long-standing influence in Central Asia appears to wane due to the war in Ukraine, and amid increasing concerns regarding China's role in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. These factors raise the question of whether an important new geopolitical bloc is emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## International Organizations and Ethno-National Ties

While international relations typically focus on individual sovereign states, the post-1945 era has seen a rise in international organizations where states unite for various reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. These reasons can include shared political, economic, or security outlooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, regional cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, or religious affinity and historical relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Uniquely, there are also instances where groups of states with shared ethno-national links come together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The growing cooperation among Turkic states presents an interesting example of this emerging trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Defining the Turkic States

The Turkic states form an arc stretching from Europe to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. They are generally understood to include six specific countries:
*   Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>
*   Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>
*   Turkmenistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>
*   Uzbekistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>
*   Kazakhstan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>
*   Kyrgyzstan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>

Additionally, Turkic communities exist in numerous other countries, including Russia, China, Iran, Mongolia, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Georgia, Greece, Bulgaria, Moldova, and Cyprus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

Collectively, these six countries cover 4.7 million square kilometers (1.8 million square miles), which would make them the seventh-largest country globally if united <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Their combined population is 162 million, with over half residing in Turkey, making them the world's ninth most populous state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Economically, their total GDP is nearly $1.2 trillion, placing them as the 15th largest economy worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

The primary link between these countries is language, forming a single, closely related language family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. There are also strong religious ties, with the majority adhering to Sunni Islam, though many are secular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Azerbaijan is an exception, being predominantly Shia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, and Christian Turkic communities exist in Russia and Moldova <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## [[historical_and_cultural_ties_among_turkic_states | Historical Context of Turkic Peoples]]

The roots of Turkic peoples are generally traced to the Altai mountains, near present-day Russia, China, Kazakhstan, and Mongolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. In the 6th century, they expanded westward, conquering much of Central Asia and establishing a Turkic Empire centered on the Silk Road <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. This empire fostered cultural, trading, and intellectual exchange between East and West for centuries until it fell under Mongol and Chinese rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

Turkic expansion continued beyond their original heartlands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. After converting to Islam in the 8th century, the Seljuk Turkic tribe moved into the Middle East in the 11th century, gaining control of much of the Islamic world before pushing into the Anatolian Peninsula, the heartland of Byzantium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. A key turning point came in the late 13th century when a small Turkish tribe near the Aegean Sea began to expand its territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. They overran the Byzantine capital in 1453, and for the next 350 years, the Ottoman Turks controlled vast parts of Southeast Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### Separation and Modern Foundations

For over a thousand years, the eastern and western Turkic peoples were effectively separated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. In the 19th century, both faced a common threat from the expansion of Imperial Russia, which brought Central Asia and the Caucasus under its control and increasingly menaced the Ottoman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

World War I profoundly reshaped the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>:
*   **East:** The fall of the Russian Tsarist regime and the rise of the Soviet Union led to the creation of Soviet Socialist Republics in the 1920s and 1930s, forming the basis of today's Central Asian republics and Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   **West:** The collapse of the Ottoman Empire led to the emergence of the European-facing Republic of Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

This period marked a profound divergence, with Turkey taking a different path from the increasingly Russified Caucasus and Central Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. The estrangement between the two parts of the Turkic world deepened during the Cold War, particularly after Turkey joined NATO, leading to almost no relations with the Turkic peoples of Central Asia for four decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

## Post-Soviet Revival and Early Challenges

The landscape changed dramatically in 1991 with the collapse of the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. The five predominantly Turkic republics gained sovereign independence, joining the United Nations on March 2, 1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

From the outset, [[turkeys_role_in_the_turkic_states_and_geopolitical_ambitions | Turkey]] sought to expand its influence over these new states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. It was the first country to recognize them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>, and in October 1992, it convened a summit in Ankara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. Other initiatives followed, such as the establishment of the International Organization of Turkic Culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

However, Turkey's early efforts to create and lead a new bloc largely failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Despite their independence, the republics remained closely tied to Moscow economically, politically, and socially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. They joined the Commonwealth of Independent States, retained substantial Russian communities (especially in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan), and Russian remained the regional common language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. As a result, Turkey's focus soon shifted back to its primary concern: joining the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Apart from a close relationship with neighboring Azerbaijan, strong ties between Turkey and the other Turkic republics did not materialize throughout the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

## Renewed Cooperation at the Millennium

This situation slowly began to change around the turn of the Millennium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. In 2002, Turkey entered a new era with the Justice and Development Party, led by [[the_transformation_of_turkey_under_erdogans_leadership | Recep Tayyip Erdogan]], coming to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. While initially focused on EU membership, by the end of the decade, Erdogan began to pursue broader horizons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. He envisioned Turkey as a major international actor, extending its influence beyond the Balkans and Middle East, including to the Turkic states of Central Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

The first concrete step in this new relationship came in October 2009, when Turkey, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan formed the Cooperation Council of Turkic Speaking States, commonly known as the Turkic Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. The group held its first summit in Almaty, Kazakhstan, in 2011, pledging to foster new economic, political, trading, and cultural links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. The group expanded with Hungary and Turkmenistan becoming observers in 2014 and 2021, respectively, and Uzbekistan becoming the fifth full member in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

Despite hopes for closer cooperation, the Council initially achieved little and was primarily seen as a discussion forum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. One notable, albeit amusing, step to build ties was Turkey's establishment of the "Turkvision" music competition in 2013, following its dissatisfaction with the Eurovision Song Contest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

## Recent Developments and Geopolitical Impetus

After years of relatively low activity, the situation began to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **Rebranding:** In late 2021, the Council rebranded itself as the [[Organization of Turkic States summit in Uzbekistan 2022 | Organization of Turkic States]], aiming for a higher profile and new impetus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
*   **2022 Summit:** This new momentum was solidified at the [[Organization of Turkic States summit in Uzbekistan 2022 | Organization's most recent summit in Uzbekistan in November 2022]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Leaders agreed on new measures to strengthen activities, including the creation of a Turkic Investment Fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
*   **Controversial Membership:** The summit controversially admitted the internationally unrecognized Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus as an observer, leading to widespread international criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

While a genuine desire for integration drives cooperation, the situation is also significantly shaped by wider [[the_impact_of_geopolitical_events_on_turkeys_diplomacy | geopolitical factors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Russia's invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 has created a growing sense that Moscow's long-standing influence over the region is rapidly declining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Kazakhstan, despite being a member of the Russian-led Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), has consistently avoided supporting Moscow's actions in Ukraine and appears to be distancing itself from Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Similar trends are observed with Uzbekistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. Latent tensions between Russia and Azerbaijan also exist, particularly after Moscow prevented Baku from driving out Armenian forces from Nagorno-Karabakh, cementing Russia's presence with a peacekeeping force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

Another key factor is China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. While many Turkic countries have established close ties with Beijing, they are also wary of China's increasing strength and influence in the region, particularly through its flagship Belt and Road Initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. Central Asia is a crucial component of this initiative, which aims to establish trading links across Asia, Africa, and into Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

These factors provide strong reasons for the Turkic countries to collaborate more closely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. There is a growing recognition of the potential value in their strong [[historical_and_cultural_ties_among_turkic_states | ethnocultural ties]], despite a long history of separation between the eastern Turkic communities and the Turkish people in the west <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

## Future Outlook

The question remains whether the Turkic states will indeed work more closely together and emerge as a new geopolitical bloc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. Some prominent voices within the [[Organization of Turkic States summit in Uzbekistan 2022 | Organization of Turkic States]] have even suggested it could become a political community modeled on the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. However, whether this translates into a firm grouping like the EU is uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

Much will depend on the impetus for integration and the articulation of a clear vision for the group's direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. The question of leadership is also critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. [[turkeys_role_in_the_turkic_states_and_geopolitical_ambitions | Turkey]] and [[the_transformation_of_turkey_under_erdogans_leadership | Recep Tayyip Erdogan]] are obvious candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. With Turkey increasingly distanced from Europe, navigating a complex relationship with Russia, and Erdogan focused on his legacy, he may seek to cement his influence as the leader of the Turkic world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. As the most populous and wealthiest country in the Organization, Turkey might feel it has a natural right to lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. However, whether the other leaders would accept such a dominant role from Turkey remains a key unanswered question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.

Nevertheless, the growing ties among the Turkic states appear to be underpinned by a more tangible sense of purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. This situation warrants close observation, as it may indeed signify the emergence of a new geopolitical grouping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

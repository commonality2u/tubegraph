Despite [[turkeys_potential_leadership_in_the_islamic_world | Turkey's efforts]] under President [[erdogans_administration_and_changing_political_outlook | Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] to reestablish its standing among Muslim-majority states and shape broader opinion on critical issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, its ambition to become the dominant power in the Islamic world faces significant challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. While the nation has demonstrated growth in diplomatic, military, and soft power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>, several factors hinder its path to overarching leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

## Deep Distrust in the Arab World
Turkey faces deep distrust in large parts of the Arab world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. This stems partly from the "bitter experience of 300 years of Turkish Ottoman colonial rule in the Middle East" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. Many Arab states continue to view Turkey and its leader with deep suspicion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

Turkey has also experienced significant bilateral tensions with several countries, including Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. Despite recent attempts to rebuild ties with Damascus and Cairo, and Turkey's first attendance at an Arab League meeting in 13 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>, many of these countries remember Turkey's past behavior and its perceived ability to change positions and abandon allies with ease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

## Inconsistent Multilateral Relationships
Many countries are suspicious of Turkey's attempts to maintain close relations with various, often conflicting, global blocs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

*   **Balancing East and West**: While actively courting Muslim states, Turkey remains a military ally of the West through NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. Simultaneously, it discusses joining BRICS, a group seen as attempting to undermine Western dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.
*   **Regional Ambitions and Russia**: Turkey aims to lead the [[turkeys_role_in_the_turkic_states_and_geopolitical_ambitions | Turkic states]], yet it also maintains a close relationship with Russia, which vies for supremacy in Central Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

Critics argue that this approach demonstrates Erdoğan's inability to be loyal to any single group, a quality not typically expected of a leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

## Strong Competition from Other Muslim States
Turkey faces strong competition from other influential states within the Muslim world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.

*   **Saudi Arabia**: Remains an incredibly influential state as the birthplace of Islam and home to its holiest sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.
*   **Egypt**: Continues to be a demographic and cultural powerhouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
*   **Indonesia and Pakistan**: Indonesia is the world's most populous Muslim state, followed by Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.
*   **Gulf States**: Qatar and the United Arab Emirates have emerged as hugely influential actors, supported by considerable oil wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
*   **Iran**: Remains the preeminent actor for many Shia Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

For these reasons, despite [[turkeys_potential_leadership_in_the_islamic_world | Turkey]] reestablishing its standing in the Muslim world under [[erdogans_administration_and_changing_political_outlook | Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>, it is unlikely to become the overarching leader due to the opposition and numerous alternative challengers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. Instead, Turkey is better considered "one amongst many influential countries" within the large and diverse group of Muslim-majority states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.

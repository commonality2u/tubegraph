Bosnia and Herzegovina, a country known for its natural beauty, remains deeply divided a quarter-century after a landmark peace agreement ended a brutal war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It operates with an unwieldy and dysfunctional political system, leading to repeated calls for fundamental changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Among these calls is the abolition of Republika Srpska, one of the country's two territorial entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

Banja Luka serves as the main city of Republika Srpska <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Historical Background

Peace agreements are often compromises, not always satisfactory to all parties, and can become sources of resentment and instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Bosnia-Herzegovina stands as a prime example in modern international relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

The nation's story traces back to the disintegration of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. In March 1992, Bosnia and Herzegovina declared independence, following Croatia, Slovenia, and Macedonia, and joined the UN months later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This declaration was rejected by the country's Serbs, who, with support from neighboring Serbia, unilaterally broke away to form their own separatist state, Republika Srpska <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

The ensuing period saw Bosnia collapse into a bitter three-way war, further complicated by the Bosnian Croats also declaring independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. In early 1994, the Bosnian Croats and Bosnian Muslims formed a joint entity in the west and center of the country, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, composed of 10 self-governing cantons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. The war with the Bosnian Serbs continued until the Srebrenica massacre in 1995, prompting intervention from the United States and European partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

### The [[dayton_accords_and_bosnias_territorial_arrangements | Dayton Accords]]

On December 14, 1995, the leaders of Bosnia, Croatia, and Serbia signed the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, widely known as the [[dayton_accords_and_bosnias_territorial_arrangements | Dayton Accords]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. This agreement saw Republika Srpska, which comprised 49 percent of Bosnia's territory, abandon its claim to independence and reintegrate into the state alongside the Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

Under the [[dayton_accords_and_bosnias_territorial_arrangements | Dayton Accords]], most day-to-day issues were managed by the entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. The central government remained weak, dealing with only a few key areas like foreign policy, immigration, and customs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. The central government's structure also reflected the entities' power: the joint presidency consisted of two members (a Bosniak and a Croat) from the Federation and one Serb from Republika Srpska <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. The Council of Ministers was similarly divided on a two-to-one ratio between the Federation and Republika Srpska <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

## Current Challenges and Calls for Reform

Initially, the country showed signs of recovery and reintegration, including the formation of a single military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. However, after about a decade, serious problems emerged as the political structures, which entrenched ethnic identity, began to be seen as discriminatory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. Failed reform attempts led to hardened positions and increased dysfunction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. The agreement now appears to be at a breaking point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### Differing Perspectives on Republika Srpska

*   **Bosnian Serb leaders** have openly discussed breaking away to form an independent state or uniting with Serbia, actions banned under the peace deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. They view Republika Srpska as a legitimate entity guaranteed by international treaties, which they feel has been increasingly challenged by Bosniaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. While their leadership speaks of secession, many Bosnian Serbs recognize this as unrealistic and a political tool used by figures like Milorad Dodik <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Despite identifying as Serbs, many consider Bosnia their homeland and acknowledge that joining Serbia would relegate them to a "provincial backwater" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. The veneration of war criminals is seen as limited to a small nationalist segment, not reflecting a broader desire for renewed conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   **Bosnian Croats** have called for their own entity, similar to Republika Srpska, a position increasingly supported by neighboring Croatia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   **Bosniaks** perceive the issues as a result of excessive decentralization, leading to a "federation within a federation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. They reject calls for a new Croatian entity and increasingly advocate for the abolition of Republika Srpska <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. Many Bosniaks argue that RS is a product of genocide and point to its difficult relationship with the central government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. They highlight that the Bosnian Serb leadership is dominated by nationalists who deny the existence of the Bosnian state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. The Bosnian Serb member of the presidency, Milorad Dodik, continually threatens a secession vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>, while Bosnian Serb leaders reportedly work to make the country dysfunctional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. Worrisome signs of Serb [[nationalism_and_secessionist_threats_in_bosnia | nationalism]] include graffiti hero-worshiping wartime leaders convicted of war crimes and a growing denial of atrocities like Srebrenica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. For Bosniaks, RS entrenches past [[nationalism_and_secessionist_threats_in_bosnia | nationalism]] and hinders the country's progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

## The Future of Republika Srpska

Bosnia undeniably needs [[bosnian_political_system_and_reform | political system reform]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. Its governance system has been deemed contrary to basic human rights, and the inability to introduce reforms impacts ordinary citizens' lives, leading to stagnation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. This failure to reform also prevents Bosnia from pursuing EU membership, a potential driver for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

Despite calls for its abolition, doing so is not a feasible solution, at least not in the foreseeable future, and would likely lead to a return to conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Bosnian Serbs are unlikely to relinquish territorial control, and there is no international support for such an idea; foreign diplomats assert that Republika Srpska is here to stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

While many countries have devolved political entities, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina is considered less functional than Republika Srpska as a single entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

However, the evolution of RS as an ethno-national entity entrenches many of Bosnia's problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. It serves as a "lightning rod" for nationalist politicians on all sides, energizing their communities and creating a destabilizing vicious circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. Bosnian Serb threats of secession prompt Bosniak calls for RS's abolition, which in turn reinforces the Bosnian Serb message that secession is their only way out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

Abolishing RS is not a panacea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Any fundamental [[bosnian_political_system_and_reform | reform]] must begin by moving away from nationalist talking points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. This requires Bosniaks and Bosnian Serbs to accept two key principles:
*   Bosnia-Herzegovina is a single, indivisible state that is here to stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.
*   Republika Srpska is an entity that makes up that state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

In essence, Bosnian Serbs need to cease questioning the territorial integrity of the Bosnian state, and Bosniaks need to stop questioning the legitimacy of Republika Srpska <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. Only then might the country reach a point where sides trust each other enough for more fundamental, compromise-based change to be realized, building foundations for a sustainable future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

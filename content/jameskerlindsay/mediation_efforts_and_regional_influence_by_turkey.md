Turkey has recently emerged as a significant diplomatic and political actor, notably demonstrating its influence through mediation efforts in the Horn of Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

## Background to Ethiopia-Somalia Tensions

For over 60 years, relations between Ethiopia and Somalia have been problematic, at times escalating to war and invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:36">[01:31:36]</a>. A major point of contention has been Ethiopia's desire for sea access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, a need that intensified after Eritrea's independence in the early 1990s rendered Ethiopia landlocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:24">[05:21:24]</a>.

On January 1, 2024, Ethiopia and Somaliland signed a memorandum of understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:01">[07:55:01]</a>. This agreement would grant Ethiopia a long-term lease over a port facility on the Red Sea for commercial and military purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:11">[08:07:11]</a>. In return, Ethiopia would recognise Somaliland's independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:18">[08:11:18]</a>. This announcement was met with jubilation in Somaliland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:24">[08:18:24]</a> but caused an immediate outcry in Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:39">[08:34:39]</a>.

Somalia denounced the deal as a fundamental infringement of its territorial integrity and sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:43">[08:39:43]</a>, subsequently expelling the Ethiopian ambassador and complaining to the UN Security Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:53">[08:48:53]</a>. Tensions escalated, with Somalia even suggesting military action and building closer defence relationships, including with Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:18">[09:11:18]</a>.

## Turkish Mediation Efforts

As relations between Ethiopia and Somalia deteriorated, with the potential for confrontation, Turkey intervened to de-escalate the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:42">[09:36:42]</a>. Turkey maintains close ties to both nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:48">[09:42:48]</a>.

Following talks in Ankara mediated by Turkish President [[erdogans_policies_and_influence | Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:53">[09:48:53]</a>, the two sides issued a joint declaration on December 11, 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:11">[09:53:11]</a>. They agreed to launch technical talks by February 2025 and aim to reach a final agreement within four months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:06">[10:00:06]</a>. The declaration acknowledged Ethiopia's potential benefits from assured sea access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:11">[10:06:11]</a>, with the goal of securing reliable, secure, and sustained access to the sea under Somalia's sovereign authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:23">[10:11:23]</a>.

## Regional Influence and Implications

The deal has been widely welcomed internationally, with support statements from the UN Secretary-General, the US State Department, and the British Foreign Office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:01">[10:49:01]</a>.

For Turkey, this agreement represents a significant diplomatic victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:05">[11:01:05]</a>. Hailed by [[erdogans_policies_and_influence | Erdoğan]] as a historic step towards peace and cooperation in the Horn of Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:10">[11:05:10]</a>, [[the_impact_of_geopolitical_events_on_turkeys_diplomacy | Ankara’s successful mediation effort]] highlights its growing influence as a political and diplomatic actor in Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:18">[11:10:18]</a>. This success is expected to increase Turkey's standing as a regional power broker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:23">[11:18:23]</a>.

However, Somaliland is the clear loser in this situation, as its hopes for Ethiopian recognition and broader international acceptance now seem premature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:39">[11:23:39]</a>.

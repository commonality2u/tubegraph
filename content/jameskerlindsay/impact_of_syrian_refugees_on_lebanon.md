## Refugee Influx

Over a million Syrians fled to Lebanon as a result of the [[impact_of_syrias_civil_war_on_international_relations | Syrian Civil War]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>. This meant that almost a quarter of Lebanon's population was made up of refugees, marking the highest proportion in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>.

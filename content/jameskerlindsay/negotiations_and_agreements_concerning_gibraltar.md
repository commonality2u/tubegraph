Britain and Spain are on the verge of a historic agreement regarding Gibraltar's place in Europe, after several years of negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This potential deal aims to tackle problems created by Britain’s decision to leave the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. While it will ease many day-to-day issues for Gibraltar, it will not resolve the 300-year-old dispute over this strategically vital territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Historical Roots of the Dispute

The [[history_of_the_gibraltar_dispute | dispute over Gibraltar]] between Britain and Spain has lasted for over 300 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Gibraltar, a small rocky peninsula at the southern end of Spain, is 5 km long and 1.2 km wide, with a total area of 6.8 square km <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Its population currently stands at 32,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

Known as one of the Pillars of Hercules in ancient times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, Gibraltar was conquered by the Umayyad Arab Muslims in 711 AD, who named it Jabal Tariq (Mountain of Tariq) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. It remained under Muslim Moorish rule for centuries, becoming heavily fortified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. The territory eventually became part of a united Spanish Kingdom in 1462 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

### Seizure and Cession to Britain

In 1704, during the War of Spanish Succession, a combined British and Dutch fleet seized Gibraltar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Britain kept control of the territory when the war ended in 1711 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Two years later, in 1713, the Treaty of Utrecht was signed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. Despite Spanish opposition, Article X of the treaty ceded Gibraltar to Britain forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Crucially, it stipulated that if Britain ever wished to relinquish sovereignty, Spain would have the first right of refusal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

Spain, however, refused to accept the loss of Gibraltar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. Britain subsequently reinforced its position, notably withstanding a Spanish and French siege in 1779 during the American War of Independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Gibraltar's significance to Britain grew, especially with the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, making it central to Britain's imperial standing and a vital trading station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. It also played a crucial role in controlling access to the Mediterranean during both World Wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

## Decolonization and Increased Pressure

The end of the Second World War brought [[history_of_the_gibraltar_dispute | Gibraltar's status]] into the international limelight with the advent of decolonization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. The newly established United Nations placed Gibraltar on its list of Non-Self-Governing Territories, initiating a formal debate about its future sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

Throughout the 1950s and 60s, the Spanish government, under dictator General Franco, increased pressure on Britain to relinquish control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Britain, however, insisted that the people of Gibraltar had a right to determine their own future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. In a 1967 referendum, 99% of Gibraltarians voted to remain under British sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. In line with UN calls for greater autonomy, a new constitution was unveiled in 1969, granting Gibraltar more control over its governance and establishing a parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Furious, Madrid responded by imposing harsh restrictions, including closing the land border, causing significant economic and social disruption for Gibraltarians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

## Thawing Relations and Early Agreements

[[anglospanish_relations_over_gibraltar | Anglo-Spanish relations]] began to improve after General Franco's death in the early 1970s and Spain's return to democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

### The Lisbon Statement and Brussels Process
In 1980, the two sides reached the Lisbon Statement, committing to resolve the matter in friendship and cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. However, Spain viewed this as paving the way for sovereignty discussions, while Britain saw it as an end to restrictions, leading to little progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. A new effort, the Brussels Process, began in 1984, designed to facilitate Spain's forthcoming EU membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. This process reinforced the message that any settlement must be through dialogue and crucially saw Spain lift its blockade on Gibraltar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

Despite Spain joining the European Union in 1986, difficulties persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. Disputes continued over border control, airspace, and territorial waters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. Gibraltar was excluded from the Schengen Area, and Spain raised concerns about the territory's low taxation and financial regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

### Joint Sovereignty Proposal and its Rejection
By the turn of the millennium, Britain and Spain began considering ideas for possible joint sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. However, another referendum held in 2002 overwhelmingly rejected this idea, with 98.9% of Gibraltarians voting for continued exclusive British rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

### The Cordoba Agreement
Despite this setback, practical progress continued. In 2006, the sides signed the Cordoba Agreement, which introduced practical improvements like easier border crossings and more flights from Gibraltar’s airport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. This agreement also acknowledged the right of Gibraltarians to be included in any discussions on their future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

## Brexit and New Negotiations

Everything changed in June 2016 when Britain held a referendum on EU membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. While Gibraltar overwhelmingly voted to remain in the European Union, Britain narrowly voted to depart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. As negotiations for Brexit began, it became clear that separate discussions would be needed to manage the complex issues arising for the three British territories with land borders to the EU: Gibraltar, Northern Ireland, and the British Sovereign Bases in [[cyprus_dispute_and_its_impact | Cyprus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

### Challenges Posed by Brexit
The [[impact_of_brexit_on_gibraltar | impact of Brexit on Gibraltar]] primarily concerns freedom of movement and border checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. Within the EU, the frontier was open for people, goods, and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. However, with the UK and Gibraltar outside the EU, this would need to change, creating significant disruption for the approximately 15,000 people who cross the border daily for work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Brexit also created a range of economic, trade, financial, and legal problems for Gibraltar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

### Post-Brexit Framework and Ongoing Talks
On December 31, 2020, just a month before Brexit, Britain and Spain reached an initial framework agreement for Gibraltar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. This agreement stipulated that any full deal would consider Gibraltar's geographical situation, international legal status, special circumstances, and relationship with Spain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

While this framework laid out the next steps, settling the exact details has proven extremely difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. Despite the EU authorizing negotiations in July 2021, progress has been slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. Although reports suggest the sides are on the verge of a deal, a final agreement has yet to be found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. Securing this final deal will be one of the first significant foreign policy tasks for the new Labour government, which took power in Britain on July 5, 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

## The Unresolved Core Dispute

Even a new deal over Gibraltar to manage daily situations will not resolve the fundamental difference between Britain and Spain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

*   **UK's Position:** The UK's stance is rooted in the principle of self-determination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. The British Government emphasizes that any change in Gibraltar's status must be approved by its residents, who continue to express a desire to remain under British rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.
*   **Spain's Position:** Spain maintains its claim to sovereignty, arguing it has a historical claim to The Rock, which was unfairly seized in the 18th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. While the Spanish Government has expressed willingness to accept some form of joint sovereignty, Gibraltarians continue to reject this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.

Ultimately, these positions appear difficult to reconcile for now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. Following Britain's decision to leave the European Union, which exacerbated previously managed problems, the key is to find ways to minimize friction for Gibraltarians, London, and Madrid going forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. The dispute, in this sense, is not settled but perpetually managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

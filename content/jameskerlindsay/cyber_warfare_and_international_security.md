The landscape of [[international_relations_and_war | international relations]] and conflict is undergoing dramatic changes, with cyber warfare emerging as a significant challenge to global peace and security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This new form of conflict departs from traditional interstate wars fought with conventional weaponry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, ushering in a new era where digital attacks can cause widespread disruption and damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## The Evolution of Conflict

While traditional wars involving bombs and bullets persist, as seen in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, the old model of interstate warfare appears increasingly out of touch with contemporary reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Cyber warfare represents a shift in how conflicts are waged, with potential damage often being far more extensive and costly than armed attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. For example, a cyber attack can bring down an entire power network, whereas a missile might only destroy a single power station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## Case Study: [[irans_cyber_attacks_on_albania | Iran's Cyber Attacks on Albania]]

The growing importance of cyber warfare was starkly highlighted by the series of destructive [[irans_cyber_attacks_on_albania | cyber attacks Iran launched on Albania]] in July and September 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. These attacks caused widespread disruption to Albania's critical infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, which the U.S. government deemed a "troubling precedent" for cyberspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### Background to the Attacks

Despite their geographical distance and cultural differences, Iran and Albania came to blows primarily due to Albania hosting the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (MEK), an exiled Iranian militia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Following their relocation to Albania between 2014-2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>, MEK switched from armed insurgency to an online campaign against the Iranian government, setting up "troll farms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. This online activity appears to have been the catalyst for Iran's cyber retaliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. Albania's staunch pro-American stance and support for [[international_relations_and_conflicts_influenced_by_kosovo | Kosovo's independence from Serbia]] also factored into its decision to accept MEK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

### Details of the Attacks

Planning for the cyber attacks began in early 2021 with infiltration of Albanian government systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. On July 15, a group identified as an Iranian state cyber actor, "Homeland Justice," launched a ransomware attack that included anti-MEK messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. This was followed by a wave of destructive malware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>, which:
*   Caused considerable disruption to critical government services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   Disrupted medical appointments and school databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.
*   Shut down government websites, including the Prime Minister's office, Parliament, and the "e-Albania" online portal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

A second attack in September targeted the police computer network, bringing down border control systems and causing large queues at entry points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

### International Response and Condemnation

Albania's Prime Minister, Edi Rama, publicly blamed the Islamic Republic of Iran, calling the attacks an act of state aggression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. In response, Albania severed diplomatic relations with Iran and expelled all Iranian diplomats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

Iran denied the allegations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>, but Albania's allies quickly rallied in support:
*   The United States heavily condemned the attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a> and imposed sanctions against the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence for "malign cyber activities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.
*   NATO Partners issued a statement condemning the attacks and promising to support Albania's cyber defense capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

However, Albania chose not to refer the matter to NATO under Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which covers collective defense, to avoid further escalation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

## Implications for International Security

The [[irans_cyber_attacks_on_albania | Iran-Albania incident]] raises critical questions about [[international_relations_and_conflict_resolution | conflict resolution]] in the cyber era and the [[role_of_international_actors_and_geopolitical_implications | role of international actors]]:
*   **Response to Cyber Attacks**: The preferred reaction to cyber attacks appears to be low-key condemnation, sanctions, and cyber retaliation, with little appetite for conventional counter-attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. This raises concerns about whether states can cause mayhem with relative impunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>, even if online attacks are viewed separately from traditional armed attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.
*   **Supporting Dissident Groups**: The attack underscores the implications of supporting dissident groups in the contemporary era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. Albania was targeted because it provided sanctuary to MEK, a group with a history of insurgency against Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. This fits into the broader history of states retaliating against countries that allow their territory to be used by armed insurgencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. While hosting such groups may be seen as justified, it carries significant risks, even at a distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

The incident highlights how [[influence_of_hybrid_threats_on_conflicts | hybrid threats]] and cyber warfare are profoundly reshaping the evolution of conflict in the 21st century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>, presenting new challenges for [[impact_on_international_relations | international relations]] and [[international_relations_and_state_borders | state borders]].

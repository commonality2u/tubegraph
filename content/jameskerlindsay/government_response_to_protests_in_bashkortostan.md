The January 2024 [[unrest_in_bashkortostan | unrest in Bashkortostan]], sparked by the sentencing of activist Fail Alsynov, prompted a strong response from both local authorities and, to a lesser extent, the Kremlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This marked the largest protest faced by Russian authorities since the start of the Ukraine war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

## Initial Response and Suppression
During the initial protests that erupted following Fail Alsynov's sentencing, riot police quickly moved to disperse demonstrators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. They employed tear gas and batons and made dozens of arrests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. The situation was further inflamed by claims of police brutality and the reported death of a protester in police custody <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

Bashkortostan's interior minister issued a warning to protesters, urging them "to come to their senses and not ruin their lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

## Local Leadership's Actions
The local leadership was "rattled" by the demonstrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Bashkortostan's leader, Radiy Khabirov, claimed that "outside forces" were behind the protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. The local government swiftly acted to prevent any further [[unrest_in_bashkortostan | unrest]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

Measures taken included:
*   **Legal Threats**: Police investigations into the protests are ongoing, with warnings that demonstrators could be charged with "mass rioting," a crime punishable by up to 15 years in jail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   **Information Control**: Social media pages suspected of promoting demonstrations were taken offline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. There were also reports of a local singer being investigated for encouraging people to join the protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
*   **Demonstrations of Support**: Efforts were made to shore up support for the administration, including a public concert held on January 26 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. However, reports suggest that public workers were coerced into attending, facing job loss if they refused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

## Moscow's Stance
Despite the seriousness of the protests, Moscow seemed intent on distancing itself from the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov disputed that the events constituted "mass [[unrest_in_bashkortostan | unrest]]" or a "mass protest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. He characterized them as "individual instances" and described them as a "local problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

## Outcomes and Implications
Following the initial surge of demonstrations, the situation in [[bashkortostans_historical_and_economic_background | Bashkortostan]] appears to have quietened down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. While the government's response seemingly contained the immediate spread of the protests, these events represent the most serious outbreak of ethnic rioting in Russia since the start of the Ukraine war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. The protests, occurring in Russia's most populous republic, indicate how the conflict in Ukraine can exacerbate deeper ethnic resentment linked to local grievances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. This makes the [[unrest_in_bashkortostan | unrest in Bashkortostan]] a potentially "very worrying development for the Kremlin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

Around the world, many territories vie for independence and international recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Among these, Somaliland appears to have a strong claim to international acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. It seceded from Somalia in 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a> and meets all the main criteria for statehood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, also enjoying considerable international sympathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Despite this, after three decades, it remains completely unrecognised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This article explores why Somaliland has faced such an uphill battle to gain formal international acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

Somaliland has emerged as one of the most interesting cases of secession in modern international politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Located in the Horn of Africa on the coast of the Gulf of Aden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, it has effectively existed as a fully independent entity for the past 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Despite maintaining strong relations with several countries, all its efforts to persuade the international community to recognise it have failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## [[historical_context_of_somaliland_independence | Historical Context]]

The territory of Somaliland first emerged in the late 19th century when the area fell under British colonial rule, becoming the British Somaliland Protectorate in 1884 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This distinguished it from neighbouring Italian Somaliland to the east and south <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

As Britain withdrew from its empire, the territory was granted independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. On June 26, 1960, the State of Somaliland came into existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a> and was immediately recognised by over 30 countries, including the United Kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

However, this new country was short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Just days later, on July 1, 1960, the Italian-administered Trust Territory of Somaliland also became independent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, and the two countries officially merged to form the Somali Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### An Unhappy Union and Secession

Despite initial jubilation, the unification quickly became an unhappy relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. In 1961, a new constitution was passed, which was opposed by Somaliland voters, effectively downgrading Somaliland to an autonomous province of the Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Resentment grew as Somaliland became increasingly marginalised by the Somali central government in Mogadishu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This sense of alienation intensified after Somalia fell under the dictatorial rule of General Siad Barre following a coup in 1969 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

In the late 1980s, the central government violently suppressed an uprising in Somaliland, leading to the deaths of tens of thousands and heavy bombing of the province's capital, Hargeisa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. In January 1991, Barre was overthrown by clan forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This did not usher in stability but instead led to a civil war in the south of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. As the rest of Somalia descended into conflict and anarchy, Somaliland seized the opportunity to break away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. On May 18, 1991, it unilaterally declared independence, or as its leaders prefer to say, reclaimed its independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

## Meeting the Criteria for Statehood

In the three decades since its secession, Somaliland has consolidated its position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. It is now widely accepted that it meets the criteria for statehood laid down by the Montevideo Convention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>:

*   **Defined Territory:** Somaliland has a defined territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. However, the situation is complicated by an ongoing boundary dispute with neighbouring [[somalilandpuntland_conflict | Puntland]], an autonomous province of Somalia to its east <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Additionally, a secessionist movement has emerged in eastern Somaliland seeking to break away and unite with Somalia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Despite these complexities, Somaliland still meets the territorial requirements for statehood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **Settled Population:** It clearly has a settled population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, estimated to be between 3.5 and 4 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
*   **Government:** Somaliland has a government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, which is one of its key selling points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. In contrast to the political chaos in Somalia, Somaliland has been a bastion of calm and stability for much of the past thirty years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. Crucially, its government is fully independent and not a proxy for another power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   **Capacity to Enter into Relations with Other States:** Somaliland enjoys greater international acceptance than many other wholly unrecognised states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. It maintains good relations with its neighbours and has established representative offices in the United States, as well as several European and African countries, though these have no formal diplomatic status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. It has particularly close ties with Britain, which provides aid and whose officials often meet with Somaliland leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. A significant meeting occurred in January 2019 when then British Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson paid an official visit to Hargeisa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. However, London continues to insist that it recognises the territorial integrity of Somalia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

Additionally, Somaliland maintains many other trappings of statehood, including its own flag, currency, and Armed Forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. It even enjoys direct flights to neighbouring countries like Ethiopia, Kenya, and Dubai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

## Why Hasn't It Been Recognized?

The reasons for Somaliland's lack of recognition are both easy and hard to explain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

### Legal and Perceptual Challenges

*   **Previous Independence:** Its previous independence has little formal bearing on the discussion under international law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. A territory that voluntarily gives up its independence to join another country does not have a right to reclaim its statehood at will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. While this is an important moral argument for Somaliland leaders, it doesn't carry much weight legally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Unique Case:** The traditional rules concerning secession don't seem to apply to Somaliland in the same way they do elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Somaliland has not faced the opprobrium usually reserved for unilateral secession in international politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. This might be because it was once an independent country and is not a case of invasion and occupation by an external actor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. It has long been tacitly understood to be a special case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

### African Union Recommendations and Lack of Consensus

In 2005, the African Union sent a fact-finding mission to Somaliland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. Its final report recommended recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. It highlighted the country's steps towards becoming a "modern state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>, noting that Somaliland's situation was "unique and self-justified in African political history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a> and should not be linked to the "notion of opening a Pandora's box" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. This was highly significant, as it seemed to offer Somaliland a path to eventual full international recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. The view emerged that if the African Union accepted its independence, others would follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. However, despite this steer, African countries were unable to reach a consensus on the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>, and Somaliland has remained unrecognized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

### Wider International Concerns

A decade and a half later, recognition seems unlikely anytime soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

*   **Border Redrawing:** The long-standing nervousness about redrawing borders in Africa remains an issue, despite the report's view that it wouldn't set a precedent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   **Somalia's Stability:** Many Western countries, including the United Kingdom, are concerned about the effects of Somaliland's independence on the significant efforts made since 2012 to stabilise and rebuild Somalia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. There is a clear fear that if Somaliland is allowed to go its own way, other parts of Somalia will try to follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. This fracturing could make tackling problems like warlordism, terrorist groups, and piracy even more difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
*   **Peace Talks:** In recent years, efforts have been made to bring the sides into formal peace talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. While these talks may not reach a mutually acceptable settlement, few countries want to prejudice the outcome by taking a decision on recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

## Potential Future Factors

Leaders in Somaliland argue that other geopolitical factors might work in their favour for recognition, such as increasing interest in their port facilities, including reports that Russia wants to establish a naval base there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:10:07]</a>. However, this remains speculative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

## Conclusion

Somaliland is a fascinating and paradoxical case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. While its previous existence as an independent state doesn't officially impact its claim, it does shape perceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. It demonstrably meets the four conditions for statehood: a clearly defined territory, a settled population, an independent government, and a proven capacity to enter into relations with other states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

There is not the same hostility towards Somaliland's independence as in other secession cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>; many tacitly understand and sympathise with its case, given the state of the rest of Somalia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. As things stand, [[somalilands_quest_for_international_recognition | Somaliland's quest for international recognition]] is held back by a combination of African concern about secession and wider Western concern about Somalia's stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. Ultimately, its biggest problem is not strong opposition to its existence as an independent state, but rather international concern about the [[implications_of_ethiopian_recognition_for_somalia | implications of formally recognizing that independence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

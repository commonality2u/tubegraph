The [[Ethiopian Civil War in Tigray | brutal war]] between [[Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and regional tensions | Ethiopia]] and its northern province of [[Tigray Crisis in Ethiopia | Tigray]] was, for a period, considered the world's deadliest conflict, largely ignored due to international attention on Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Over two years, the [[Tigray Crisis in Ethiopia | conflict]] saw dramatic shifts in momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. A last-minute peace agreement was reached as [[Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and regional tensions | Ethiopia]] and its allies were poised for a final military victory, which many feared could lead to a bloodbath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## The Peace Agreement
On November 2, 2022, news emerged from South Africa that representatives of the [[Ethiopian government and Amhara militia conflict | Ethiopian federal government]] and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) had signed a momentous peace agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This agreement, reached after 10 days of intensive negotiations organized by the African Union and chaired by Nigeria's former president, aimed to "permanently silence the guns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

The agreement came at a critical time, as the fighting in northern [[Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and regional tensions | Ethiopia]] had reportedly cost up to half a million lives and displaced over 3 million people over two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. The federal [[Ethiopian government and Amhara militia conflict | Ethiopian government]], supported by forces from Eritrea, had gained the upper hand and was preparing for a final offensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. At the start of the talks, many observers were skeptical, believing [[Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and regional tensions | Ethiopia]] was determined to achieve a decisive victory over the TPLF due to deep-seated hatred between the sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Background on Ethiopia
The [[Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and regional tensions | Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia]], located in East Africa, spans 1.1 million square kilometers (approximately 430,000 square miles), making it the 26th largest member of the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. With a population of around 120 million, it is Africa's second most populous country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. The population comprises almost a hundred different ethnic groups, with the largest being the Oromo (around one-third) and Amhara (around one-quarter), followed by [[Historical tensions and conflicts between Ethiopia and Somalia | Somalis]] and Tigrayans (around six percent each) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

[[Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and regional tensions | Ethiopia]] is divided into nine autonomous regional states, largely aligned with main ethnic groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. [[Tigray Crisis in Ethiopia | Tigray]] is the country's northernmost region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Historically known as Abyssinia, [[Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and regional tensions | Ethiopia]] was never formally colonized by European powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. In 1945, it became one of only four African founding members of the United Nations, alongside Egypt, Liberia, and South Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## Historical Context of the Conflict
The origins of the recent [[Ethiopian Civil War in Tigray | conflict]] can be traced back to the 1960s, when northern [[Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and regional tensions | Ethiopia]] descended into conflict as Eritrea began its war for independence after being granted to [[Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and regional tensions | Ethiopia]] by the UN in 1952 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

Following the overthrow of Emperor Haile Selassie by a Marxist military coup in 1974, the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF) allied with other ethno-national rebel groups, including the TPLF, to fight the Soviet-supported regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. In May 1991, at the end of the Cold War, these forces seized Addis Ababa, overthrowing the military government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. This led to Eritrea's independence and the reorganization of the rest of [[Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and regional tensions | Ethiopia]] as a democratic federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

### Tigrayan Dominance and Abiy Ahmed's Rise
Despite its multi-ethnic character, [[Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and regional tensions | Ethiopia]] quickly became dominated by Tigrayans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. It became a one-party state under the TPLF-dominated Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. A subsequent falling out between the TPLF and EPLF over the border in [[Tigray Crisis in Ethiopia | Tigray]] led to a bitter two-year war between [[Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and regional tensions | Ethiopia]] and Eritrea, which may have resulted in up to 300,000 deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

In 2018, everything changed. Following major protests, Abiy Ahmed Ali, an ethnic Oromo, became the leader of the EPRDF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. He immediately began dismantling Tigrayan power, dissolving the Front in 2019 and forming the ethnically unified Prosperity Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. The TPLF refused to join, accusing him of increasing authoritarianism and attempting to centralize power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Tensions also grew when Abiy Ahmed signed a landmark border agreement with Eritrea in 2019, an act for which he won the Nobel Peace Prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

### The Spark of Conflict
The final countdown to war began in March 2020. Due to Covid-19, [[Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and regional tensions | Ethiopia's]] electoral commission postponed general elections planned for August <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. The TPLF, viewing this as a power grab, refused to accept the decision and proceeded with holding the vote in [[Tigray Crisis in Ethiopia | Tigray]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. By October, [[Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and regional tensions | Ethiopia]] was in political crisis, with the federal and Tigrayan governments no longer recognizing each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. [[Tigray Crisis in Ethiopia | Tigray]] withdrew from national institutions and refused the appointment of a new commander for the Ethiopian National Defense Forces in the region, leading the federal government to cut funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

The immediate trigger for the [[Ethiopian Civil War in Tigray | conflict]] was an attack on a federal military barracks in [[Tigray Crisis in Ethiopia | Tigray]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. On November 4, 2020, Abiy Ahmed addressed the nation, accusing the TPLF of raiding the barracks to steal weapons, imposing a six-month state of emergency, and ordering the national army to reassert control over [[Tigray Crisis in Ethiopia | Tigray]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

## Course of the Conflict
Concerns about the situation were immediate. While [[Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and regional tensions | Ethiopia]] had experienced insurgencies before, this [[Ethiopian Civil War in Tigray | conflict]] was seen as far more serious due to the TPLF's significant weapons, manpower, and highly capable military commanders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Abiy Ahmed made it clear he intended to win by force, rejecting mediation offers from African figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

Initially, his plan seemed to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Within a month, federal forces seized Mekele, the Tigrayan capital, and installed a new administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. However, this jubilation was premature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. The TPLF, having retreated from towns, began regrouping in rural areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. Reports of atrocities emerged across [[Tigray Crisis in Ethiopia | Tigray]], with credible allegations that Abiy Ahmed had enlisted support from Eritrea to destroy the TPLF, despite communications being cut off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Additionally, the neighboring [[Ethiopian government and Amhara militia conflict | federal state of Amhara]], which had a long-standing boundary dispute with [[Tigray Crisis in Ethiopia | Tigray]], joined the fight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

By early 2021, the situation in [[Tigray Crisis in Ethiopia | Tigray]] was dire, with food and medical supplies running short and communications still cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. International concern grew over the Ethiopian government's tactics, with some observers calling the siege "a weapon of war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. An EU regional envoy reported that an Ethiopian official had stated an intention to "wipe out" the Tigrayans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

### Turning Points and Negotiations
Events changed dramatically when the Tigrayan Defense Force (TDF), led by senior generals, launched a major counter-offensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. By July 2021, the TDF had retaken Mekele and much of [[Tigray Crisis in Ethiopia | Tigray]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. The TPLF then laid down its demands for peace talks: full withdrawal of Ethiopian and Eritrean troops from [[Tigray Crisis in Ethiopia | Tigray]], complete lifting of the siege, and recognition of the TPLF as [[Tigray Crisis in Ethiopia | Tigray's]] legitimate government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. As federal troops retreated, Tigrayan forces pushed southwards through [[Ethiopian government and Amhara militia conflict | Amhara]] towards Addis Ababa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. Some suggested [[Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and regional tensions | Ethiopia]] might face a repeat of 1991, when the TPLF marched into the capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

However, the war took another unexpected turn when [[Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and regional tensions | Ethiopia]] began acquiring combat drones from Turkey, Iran, and China, which had stunning effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. By early 2022, Tigrayan forces, having reached within 120 kilometers of the capital, were pushed back, and [[Tigray Crisis in Ethiopia | Tigray]] was again under siege <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Ghebreyesus (a Tigrayan), called it the world's worst health crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

With the [[Ethiopian Civil War in Tigray | conflict]] ongoing for 16 months, international pressure for talks grew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. On March 24, the [[Ethiopian government and Amhara militia conflict | Ethiopian government]] announced a unilateral humanitarian ceasefire, which the TPLF soon agreed to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. While the African Union led public settlement efforts, the United States also convened secret talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. No agreement was reached, and the ceasefire collapsed in August 2022 after five months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. This led to some of the most intense fighting, as [[Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and regional tensions | Ethiopia]] and its allies made a final push for victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. Reports indicated a full Eritrean national mobilization, and major towns in [[Tigray Crisis in Ethiopia | Tigray]] fell to federal forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. The UN Secretary-General warned the situation was "spiralling out of control" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

It was at this critical juncture that the African Union announced surprise talks in South Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. Despite widespread skepticism, an agreement was reached on November 2, 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

## Key Points of the Peace Deal
The peace deal is built around four main points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>:
1.  **Territorial Integrity**: It confirms [[Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and regional tensions | Ethiopia's]] territorial integrity, with [[Tigray Crisis in Ethiopia | Tigray]] remaining part of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.
2.  **Single National Defense Force**: [[Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and regional tensions | Ethiopia]] will have a single National Defense Force, meaning the TDF will be disarmed and disbanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.
3.  **Constitutional Order in Tigray**: The constitutional order will be re-established in [[Tigray Crisis in Ethiopia | Tigray]], likely involving new elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. The TPLF's continued political force status is implied by its participation in the agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
4.  **Humanitarian Aid and Reconstruction**: Humanitarian aid will be sent to the region, and reconstruction efforts will begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

Both the [[Ethiopian government and Amhara militia conflict | government]] and the TPLF agreed to promote the peace deal and call on all Ethiopians to support it, using language designed to foster national unity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

## Reasons for the Agreement
The outcome represents a clear victory for the [[Ethiopian government and Amhara militia conflict | Ethiopian government]], but it also offers enough to the TPLF to secure its support in the face of final defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

The agreement spared the [[Ethiopian government and Amhara militia conflict | government]] from a final onslaught and further horrific loss of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. Additionally, preserving the TPLF, rather than wiping it out, could be more valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. Allowing a demilitarized TPLF to remain in political control in the north might be more sensible than imposing a resented new administration after a catastrophic military defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

Considerable encouragement and coercion likely occurred behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. This may have included promises of reconstruction aid or warnings of serious sanctions, including war crimes investigations, if cooperation failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. The deal also seems to pave the way for internal arrangements for justice and reconciliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

## International Role and Outlook
The agreement is a remarkable achievement, with special credit due to the African Union and IGAD (the main regional organization), as well as the United States for its important behind-the-scenes role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. Had the talks failed, the situation could have escalated to a horrific extent, potentially even a genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.

While it cannot be definitively stated that the [[Ethiopian Civil War in Tigray | conflict]] is over, much depends on the implementation of the agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. Skepticism remains about the sides' ability to reconcile given the deep-seated hatred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. However, after two years of bitter and bloody conflict, which resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths and millions displaced, [[Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and regional tensions | Ethiopia]] appears to be on the path to peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

Somaliland, a northern region of Somalia, declared its independence as the Republic of Somaliland on May 18, 1991, following the collapse of central government authority in Somalia and the country's descent into civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. This act was a response to the anarchy and chaos that engulfed the rest of Somalia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

## Historical Context
Historically, the territory that would become Somaliland was once British Somaliland, while other Somali-inhabited lands on the coast were divided between the French, British, and Italians during the late 19th century colonial period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. In 1960, British and Italian Somaliland united to form the independent Somali Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. However, the society remained divided by a complex network of clan affiliations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. The pursuit of a "Greater Somalia" by Somali nationalists, aiming to unite all Somali-inhabited areas, including parts of Kenya and the Ogaden region in Ethiopia, further complicated regional relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

Despite becoming an "island of stability" amidst Somalia's collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>, [[Somalilands struggle for international recognition | Somaliland's regular calls for recognition]] have largely been ignored by the international community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. While many countries, including Britain and the United States, have expressed sympathy for its case for independence and have met with Somaliland officials, the prevailing view has been that African states should initiate recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

## Ethiopian Deal and its Aftermath
In a significant development, Ethiopia and Somaliland signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on January 1, 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. This agreement stipulated that in exchange for a long-term lease over a Red Sea port facility for commercial and military purposes, Ethiopia would recognize Somaliland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

The announcement was met with "jubilation" in Somaliland, with many Somalilanders viewing it as a crucial breakthrough that could lead to further recognition and potentially pave the way for [[Challenges and prospects for Somalilands UN membership | UN membership]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

However, the deal caused an immediate outcry in Mogadishu, Somalia's capital. The Somali government denounced it as a "fundamental infringement" of its territorial integrity and sovereignty, expelling the Ethiopian ambassador and complaining to the UN Security Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. Somalia highlighted how the Ethiopian decision would undermine its stability as it sought to reestablish internal authority and rebuild its regional standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

Despite initial Ethiopian commitment to the deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>, Turkey mediated talks between Ethiopia and Somalia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. On December 11, 2024, the two sides issued a joint declaration agreeing to technical talks aimed at allowing Ethiopia "reliable, secure, and sustained access to the sea under Somaliaâ€™s sovereign authority" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

## Setback for Somaliland
This mediation and the subsequent agreement between Ethiopia and Somalia represented a significant setback for Somaliland. Having "pinned its hopes" on Ethiopian recognition as the path to broader African and international acceptance, Somaliland's optimism proved "premature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

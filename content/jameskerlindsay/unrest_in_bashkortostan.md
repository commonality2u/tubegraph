In January 2024, the Russian Republic of Bashkortostan experienced significant unrest, with thousands taking to the streets in violent protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This event raised questions about whether the ongoing [[azerbaijan_and_armenian_conflict_in_nagornokarabakh | war in Ukraine]] could be fueling separatism within Russia, especially given the disproportionate effect of the war on Russia's ethnic minorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

Initially, the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 led to speculation that the war could cause the collapse of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. However, Russia's outer regions remained firmly under Moscow's control until this recent unrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Russia's Federal Structure and Diversity

The Russian Federation is the world's largest country, spanning approximately 17.1 million square kilometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. It shares nearly 20,000 kilometers of borders with 14 neighboring countries, from Norway in the west to North Korea in the east <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

Its population is around 145 million and is highly diverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. While ethnic Russians form the majority, there are almost 200 distinct ethnic groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Russian Orthodoxy is the predominant religion, but Islam, Buddhism, and other faiths are also practiced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

Administratively, Russia is divided into 83 distinct federal subjects, including republics, territories, and autonomous areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Bashkortostan Overview

Bashkortostan, located in the southern Ural Mountains near Russia's border with Kazakhstan, is Russia's sixth-largest republic by area, covering 143,000 square kilometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. With four million inhabitants, it ranks first in population among Russian republics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

### [[ethnic_diversity_and_tensions_in_bashkortostan | Ethnic Diversity]]

Bashkortostan is ethnically diverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. According to the 2010 census:
*   Ethnic Russians comprise 36% of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   Ethnic Bashkirs, a Turkic group speaking a language related to Kazakh, Kyrgyz, and Tatar, make up around 30% and are predominantly Sunni Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   Tatars, another Muslim Turkic community, constitute a quarter of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

### [[bashkortostans_historical_and_economic_background | Economic Background]]

[[bashkortostans_historical_and_economic_background | Economically]], Bashkortostan possesses considerable mineral wealth, including oil, gas, iron ore, manganese, and copper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. It also has a significant manufacturing base and extensive agriculture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

## [[bashkortostans_historical_and_economic_background | Historical Background]]

Bashkortostan has a rich and complex history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   Turkic-speaking tribes, including the Bashkirs, migrated to the region in the 7th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   In 1235, the Mongols conquered the Bashkirs, making the area part of the Kipchak Khanate (Golden Horde) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
*   It later fell under the Kazan Khanate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   Russian forces under Ivan the Terrible expanded into the Urals in the 16th century, leading to the Bashkirs' conquest and incorporation into Imperial Russia in 1557 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   Ethnic Russians began settling in the region, and Bashkirs repeatedly rebelled against Russian rule for three centuries, though it remained under imperial control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   The Russian Revolution in 1917 led to the declaration of the Idel-Ural State, followed by a separate entity called Bashkiria by Bashkir nationalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   Both were short-lived, as the Red Army overran the region in 1919, establishing the Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (ASSR) within the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
*   Post-USSR, in December 1991, the Bashkir ASSR was renamed Bashkortostan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   In 1994, an agreement with Moscow granted Bashkortostan extensive autonomy within the Russian Federation, including complete control over its natural resources and environmental protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

## Roots of Discontent

Despite the autonomy agreement, the situation in Bashkortostan has become increasingly strained over the past three decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>:
*   **Reduced Autonomy:** There has been a steady rollback of the republic's autonomy, with power increasingly centralized in Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
*   **[[bashkortostans_historical_and_economic_background | Economic Exploitation]] and Environmental Damage:** Growing unhappiness about the region's [[bashkortostans_historical_and_economic_background | economic exploitation]] is tied to substantial environmental damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
*   **[[ethnic_diversity_and_tensions_in_bashkortostan | Interethnic Tensions]]:** [[ethnic_diversity_and_tensions_in_bashkortostan | Tensions]] have grown, particularly between the Bashkirs and Tatars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
*   **Bashkir Resentment:** This has led to a resurgence of support for increased language and cultural rights, and the emergence of social and ecological movements like Bashkort, which was banned in 2020 for extremism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **Impact of the [[azerbaijan_and_armenian_conflict_in_nagornokarabakh | War in Ukraine]]:** Outlying regions and their ethnic communities have been disproportionately affected by the [[azerbaijan_and_armenian_conflict_in_nagornokarabakh | war in Ukraine]], facing higher casualties and reduced government spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

## The January 2024 Protests

The immediate catalyst for the widespread protests was the arrest and sentencing of Fail Alsynov, an activist and former leader of the banned group Bashkort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

*   Alsynov was arrested for inciting racial hatred during a protest against gold mining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
*   He had previously voiced concerns about the disproportionate casualties from Bashkortostan and other poorer Russian regions in the [[azerbaijan_and_armenian_conflict_in_nagornokarabakh | war in Ukraine]], calling the mobilization a "genocide" of the Bashkir people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
*   Alsynov was accused of using a derogatory term against guest workers from the Caucasus and Central Asia, which he insisted was a mistranslation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   On January 17, 2024, a provincial court sentenced him to four years in a penal colony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   Alsynov appealed the sentence, claiming he was a victim of state oppression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

The verdict sparked outrage among his supporters, hundreds, if not thousands, of whom had traveled to the small southern Bashkortostan town for the trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. This quickly led to clashes with riot police, who used tear gas and batons, making dozens of arrests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

In the days that followed, more protests erupted, defying warnings from Bashkortostan's interior minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. A major demonstration occurred in Ufa, the capital of Bashkortostan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. Claims of police brutality and the death of a protester in police custody further inflamed the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

The demonstrations represented one of the most serious outbreaks of [[ethnic_diversity_and_tensions_in_bashkortostan | ethnic tensions]] in recent years, and seemingly the largest protest faced by Russian authorities since the start of the [[azerbaijan_and_armenian_conflict_in_nagornokarabakh | Ukraine war]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

## [[government_response_to_protests_in_bashkortostan | Government Response]] and Moscow's Reaction

The local leadership was rattled by the protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Bashkortostan's leader, Radiy Khabirov, blamed outside forces for the protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>, and the local government moved quickly to control further unrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>:
*   Police investigations continued, with warnings that demonstrators could be charged with mass rioting, carrying a 15-year jail term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   Social media pages promoting demonstrations were taken offline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   A local singer was reportedly under investigation for calling on people to join the protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
*   Efforts were made to shore up support for the administration, including a public concert on January 26, where public workers were reportedly forced to attend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

Moscow appeared keen to distance itself from the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov disputed that the events amounted to mass unrest, calling them "individual instances" and a "local problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

## Potential Implications and Outlook

While there are reasons to suggest that such local instances could spread and become dangerous, given Russia's considerable [[ethnic_diversity_and_tensions_in_bashkortostan | ethnic diversity]], discontent driven by discrimination, economic deprivation, and anger over disproportionate losses in the [[azerbaijan_and_armenian_conflict_in_nagornokarabakh | war in Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>, it is important to keep the developments in proportion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

At this stage, there is little to suggest the unrest is the start of a significant uprising in Bashkortostan or more widely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. The protests involved several thousand demonstrators, a small fraction of Bashkortostan's population, and appear to have quieted down after an initial flurry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. Furthermore, ethnic Russians outnumber Bashkirs in the republic, and the Bashkirs do not appear to have a natural alliance with the Tatars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

Nevertheless, the protests cannot be dismissed as an entirely localized incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. This was the most serious outbreak of [[ethnic_diversity_and_tensions_in_bashkortostan | ethnic rioting]] in Russia since the start of the [[azerbaijan_and_armenian_conflict_in_nagornokarabakh | Ukraine war]], and it occurred in Russia's most populous republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. The unrest in Bashkortostan indicates how the conflict in Ukraine has the potential to catalyze deeper [[ethnic_diversity_and_tensions_in_bashkortostan | ethnic resentment]] based on local grievances, posing a "very worrying development" for the Kremlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

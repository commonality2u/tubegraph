The international community played a multifaceted role in the conflict between Ethiopia and its northern province of Tigray, which spanned two years and resulted in significant loss of life and displacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Initially, attention was firmly fixed on Ukraine, leading the international community to largely overlook what became one of the world's deadliest conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Growing Concern and Early Mediation Attempts

Despite the conflict's intensity, Abiy Ahmed Ali, the Ethiopian Prime Minister, initially rejected mediation offers from senior African figures, indicating his intent to secure victory through armed force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. As the conflict progressed, with severe humanitarian consequences like food and medical shortages and communication blackouts, international concern grew regarding the Ethiopian government's tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. The EU's regional envoy, for instance, reported that a federal official explicitly stated Ethiopia's intent to "wipe out" the Tigrayans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. The head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Ghebreyesus, a Tigrayan himself, described the situation as "the world's worst health crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

## Pressure for Talks and Ceasefire Efforts

By early 2022, after 16 months of fighting, [[international_relations_and_conflict_resolution | international pressure]] for peace talks intensified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. On March 24, 2022, the Ethiopian government announced a unilateral humanitarian ceasefire, which the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) soon agreed to as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. This truce sparked hopes for formal peace negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

While the African Union (AU) publicly led settlement efforts, the United States also convened its own secret talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. However, these efforts failed to produce an agreement, and the ceasefire collapsed in August 2022, leading to some of the most intense fighting of the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. The UN Secretary-General warned that the situation was "spiralling out of control" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

## The Peace Agreement of November 2022

It was at this critical juncture that the [[African_Union | African Union]] announced surprise talks in South Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. Despite widespread skepticism about the possibility of a peaceful resolution, a monumental peace agreement was reached on November 2, 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

The negotiations were organized by the [[African_Union | African Union]] and chaired by the former president of Nigeria, leading the two sides to agree to "permanently silence the guns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

The peace deal's terms confirm Ethiopia's territorial integrity, establish a single National Defense Force (requiring the disarmament and disbandment of the TDF), and re-establish the constitutional order in Tigray, likely through new elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Furthermore, humanitarian aid and reconstruction efforts are to begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

## Behind-the-Scenes Influence

The agreement, which offered enough to the TPLF to secure its support in the face of impending military defeat, suggests significant "encouragement and coercion behind the scenes" from international actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. While the exact details remain unknown, this likely included promises of reconstruction aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. Moreover, the parties may have been warned of potential serious sanctions, including the possibility of war crimes investigations, if they failed to cooperate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

The agreement also seems to pave the way for internal arrangements regarding justice and reconciliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. The success of the peace deal is considered a remarkable achievement, with special credit given to the [[African_Union | African Union]] and IGAD (the main regional organization), as well as the [[United_States | United States]] for its important behind-the-scenes role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. Had the talks failed, the situation could have escalated into a truly horrific scenario, possibly even a genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.

Somaliland, located in the Horn of Africa on the coast of the Gulf of Aden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>, emerged as one of the most interesting cases of [[secession_and_independence_movements_in_africa | secession]] in modern international politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:19">[00:56:19]</a>. While many territories globally vie for independence and international recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, Somaliland appears to have a strong claim to international acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. It meets all main criteria for statehood and enjoys considerable international sympathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. However, despite existing as an effectively independent entity for 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:08">[01:06:08]</a>, it remains completely unrecognized after three decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>. All efforts to persuade the international community to recognise it have failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:10">[01:15:10]</a>. This article explores [[somalilands_struggle_for_international_recognition | Somaliland's struggle for international recognition]] and why it has faced an uphill battle to gain formal international acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>.

## Historical Background and Early Independence

The territory of Somaliland first emerged in the late 19th century when it fell under British colonial rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:21">[01:25:21]</a>. It became the British Somaliland Protectorate in 1884 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:07">[01:31:07]</a>, distinguishing it from neighboring Italian Somaliland to the east and south <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:19">[01:35:19]</a>. As Britain withdrew from its empire, the decision was made to grant the territory independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:07">[01:40:07]</a>.

On June 26, 1960, the State of Somaliland came into existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:15">[01:45:15]</a>. It was immediately recognized by over 30 countries, including the United Kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:04">[01:51:04]</a>.

## Unification and Subsequent Disillusionment

Despite its initial recognition, the new country was short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:08">[01:57:08]</a>. Just days later, on July 1, 1960, the Italian-administered Trust Territory of Somaliland became independent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:10">[02:00:10]</a>, and the two countries officially merged to form the Somali Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>.

Initial jubilation at unification quickly faded into an unhappy relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:06">[02:12:06]</a>. In 1961, a new constitution was passed, despite opposition from Somaliland voters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:15">[02:17:15]</a>, effectively downgrading Somaliland to an autonomous province of the Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:05">[02:23:05]</a>. Resentment grew as Somaliland became increasingly marginalized by the Somali central government in Mogadishu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:10">[02:29:10]</a>. This sense of alienation intensified after Somalia fell under the dictatorial rule of General Siad Barre following a coup in 1969 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:16">[02:37:16]</a>. In the late 1980s, the central government brutally suppressed an uprising in Somaliland, leading to tens of thousands of deaths and heavy bombing of the capital, Hargeisa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:11">[02:46:11]</a>.

## Unilateral Declaration of Independence (1991)

In January 1991, Barre was overthrown by clan forces from across the country, including Somaliland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:08">[02:57:08]</a>. This, however, led to civil war in the south of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:07">[03:05:07]</a>. As the rest of Somalia descended into conflict and anarchy after the collapse of the central government in Mogadishu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>, Somaliland seized its opportunity to break away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:09">[03:16:09]</a>. On May 18, 1991, it unilaterally declared independence, or as its leaders state, it reclaimed its independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:04">[03:22:04]</a>.

## Meeting the Criteria for Statehood

In the three decades since its [[historical_context_of_somaliland_independence | secession]] from Somalia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>, Somaliland has consolidated its position to the extent that it is now widely accepted as meeting the criteria for statehood laid down by the Montevideo Convention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:03">[03:39:03]</a>.

*   **Defined Territory:** Somaliland possesses a defined territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:08">[03:46:08]</a>. This situation is complicated by an ongoing boundary dispute with neighboring Puntland, an autonomous province of Somalia to its east <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:09">[03:49:09]</a>, and a secessionist movement in eastern Somaliland seeking to unite with Somalia as a separate entity from Puntland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. Nevertheless, Somaliland meets the territorial requirements for statehood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:02">[04:14:02]</a>.
*   **Settled Population:** It clearly has a settled population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:07">[04:19:07]</a>, estimated at three and a half to four million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:09">[04:23:09]</a>.
*   **Government:** Somaliland has a demonstrably independent government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:04">[04:30:04]</a>. In contrast to the political chaos in Somalia, Somaliland has been a bastion of calm and stability for much of the past thirty years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:10">[04:35:10]</a>. There is no suspicion that its government is merely a proxy for another power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>.
*   **Capacity to Enter into Relations with Other States:** The situation is particularly interesting concerning its ability to enter into relations with other states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:06">[04:53:06]</a>. Somaliland enjoys greater international acceptance than many other wholly unrecognized states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:03">[05:00:03]</a>. It maintains good relations with its neighbors and has established representative offices in the United States, Europe, and African countries, though these lack formal diplomatic status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:07">[05:05:07]</a>. It has particularly close ties with Britain, which provides aid and whose officials often meet with Somaliland leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:06">[05:20:06]</a>. A significant meeting occurred in January 2019 when then-British Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson paid an official visit to Hargeisa and met with Somaliland's President and other ministers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:07">[05:31:07]</a>. However, London continues to insist it recognizes the territorial integrity of Somalia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.

Somaliland also maintains other trappings of statehood, including its own flag, currency, and Armed Forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:06">[05:56:06]</a>. It even enjoys direct flights to neighboring countries like Ethiopia, Kenya, and Dubai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:06">[06:06:06]</a>.

## The Struggle for Recognition: Why the Uphill Battle?

Despite meeting the criteria for statehood and enjoying international sympathy, [[somalilands_struggle_for_international_recognition | Somaliland's struggle for international recognition]] persists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>.

### The "Previous Independence" Argument

While Somaliland leaders heavily press the moral argument of its previous independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>, under international law, a territory that voluntarily gives up its independence to join another country does not have a right to reclaim its statehood at will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>. Thus, its previous independence tends to have little formal bearing on the discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>. However, it does shape perceptions about its case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>.

### A "Special Case" in Africa

Somaliland has not faced the same opprobrium usually reserved for unilateral [[secession_and_independence_movements_in_africa | secession]] in international politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>. This might be because it was once an independent country and its situation is not a case of invasion and occupation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>. It has long been tacitly understood to be a rather special case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>.

This was highlighted in 2005 when the African Union sent a fact-finding mission to Somaliland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>. Its final report recommended recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>, noting that Somaliland's situation was "unique and self-justified in African political history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a> and should not be linked to "opening a Pandora's box" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>. This was highly significant, as it seemed to offer Somaliland a path to eventual full international recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>. The view emerged that if the African Union accepted Somaliland's independence, others would follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>. However, despite this steer, African countries were unable to reach a consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>, and Somaliland remained unrecognized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>.

### Obstacles to Recognition

A decade and a half later, the chances for recognition remain slim in the short term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>.

*   **African Concerns:** Long-standing nervousness about redrawing borders in Africa remains an issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>, despite the African Union report's view that it wouldn't set a precedent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59:00">[08:59:00]</a>.
*   **Western Concerns about Somalia's Stability:** Many Western countries, including the United Kingdom, are concerned about the effects of Somaliland's independence on significant efforts made since 2012 to stabilize and rebuild Somalia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>. There is a fear that if Somaliland is recognized, other parts of Somalia might follow suit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>. This potential fracturing could make tackling problems like warlordism, terrorist groups, and piracy even more difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>.
*   **Ongoing Peace Talks:** Efforts to bring the sides into formal peace talks continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>. While talks may not reach a mutually acceptable settlement, few countries want to prejudice the outcome by taking a decision on recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:00">[09:45:00]</a>.

Somaliland leaders argue that other geopolitical factors, such as increasing interest in their port facilities (including reports of Russia wanting a naval base) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>, are now working in their favor. However, this remains speculative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

Somaliland is a fascinating case, existing in a strange grey zone when it comes to [[secession_and_independence_movements_in_africa | secession]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>. While its previous existence as an independent state doesn't officially bear on its claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:00">[10:26:00]</a>, it does shape perceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>. It most certainly meets the four conditions for statehood: a clearly defined territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>, a settled population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>, a demonstrably independent government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>, and a proven capacity to enter into relations with other states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>.

There isn't strong opposition to Somaliland's existence as an independent state, unlike in many other [[secession_and_independence_movements_in_africa | secession]] cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>. Many tacitly understand and sympathize with its case for statehood, given the state of the rest of Somalia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>. Ultimately, Somaliland's biggest problem is not strong opposition to its independence, but rather international concern about the implications of formally recognizing that independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:00">[11:33:00]</a>. It is currently held back by a combination of African concern about [[secession_and_independence_movements_in_africa | secession]] and wider Western concern about Somalia's stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:12:00]</a>.

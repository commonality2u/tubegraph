In November 2022, the leaders of the [[emergence_of_turkic_states_as_a_geopolitical_bloc | Organization of Turkic States]] convened a summit in Uzbekistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This meeting marked a significant moment, fueling speculation about the [[emergence_of_turkic_states_as_a_geopolitical_bloc | emergence of an important new geopolitical bloc]] as Russia's influence in Central Asia appears to wane and concerns about China's role grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Background: Evolution of Turkic Cooperation
International organizations often form due to shared political, economic, security outlooks, regional cooperation goals, religious affinity, or historical relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Another basis for cooperation is shared ethno-national links, which is the foundation for the Turkic states' efforts towards closer ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

The Turkic states generally include six countries: [[turkeys_role_in_the_turkic_states_and_geopolitical_ambitions | Turkey]], [[geopolitical_dynamics_involving_iran_azerbaijan_turkey_and_pakistan | Azerbaijan]], Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. These nations are primarily linked by language, forming a single language family, and by [[historical_and_cultural_ties_among_turkic_states | close religious ties]] to Sunni Islam, with [[geopolitical_dynamics_involving_iran_azerbaijan_turkey_and_pakistan | Azerbaijan]] being predominantly Shia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, five predominantly Turkic republics gained independence, joining the United Nations on March 2, 1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. [[turkeys_role_in_the_turkic_states_and_geopolitical_ambitions | Turkey]] was the first country to recognize them and convened a summit in Ankara in October 1992, attempting to [[turkeys_role_in_the_turkic_states_and_geopolitical_ambitions | create and lead a new bloc]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. However, these early efforts achieved little, as the republics remained closely tied to Moscow, and [[turkeys_role_in_the_turkic_states_and_geopolitical_ambitions | Turkey's focus soon drifted]] back to its primary goal of joining the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

A change began at the turn of the Millennium with the rise of Recep Tayyip Erdogan's Justice and Development Party in [[turkeys_role_in_the_turkic_states_and_geopolitical_ambitions | Turkey]] in 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. By the end of the decade, Erdogan began to look beyond Europe, seeing himself as a leader who would extend [[turkeys_potential_leadership_in_the_islamic_world | Turkey's influence]] over the Balkans and the Middle East, and viewing [[turkeys_role_in_the_turkic_states_and_geopolitical_ambitions | Turkey]] as a major international actor with influence stretching to the Turkic states of Central Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

This shift led to the formation of the Cooperation Council of Turkic Speaking States (Turkic Council) in October 2009, including [[turkeys_role_in_the_turkic_states_and_geopolitical_ambitions | Turkey]], [[geopolitical_dynamics_involving_iran_azerbaijan_turkey_and_pakistan | Azerbaijan]], Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. While initially a discussion forum, the Council expanded, with Hungary and Turkmenistan becoming observers and Uzbekistan a full member in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

## Key Outcomes of the 2022 Summit
The most significant change occurred in late 2021 when the Turkic Council changed its name to the [[emergence_of_turkic_states_as_a_geopolitical_bloc | Organization of Turkic States]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. This renaming was clearly designed to give the group a higher profile and new momentum, which was further cemented at the November 2022 summit in Uzbekistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

At the summit, leaders agreed on a package of new measures aimed at strengthening the group's activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
*   **Turkic Investment Fund**: A significant outcome was the creation of a Turkic Investment Fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
*   **Northern Cyprus Observer Status**: Controversially, the summit admitted the internationally unrecognized Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus as an observer, a decision that garnered widespread international criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

## Geopolitical Context and Implications
The drive for greater cooperation among Turkic states is shaped by wider geopolitical factors, most notably Russia's invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   **Declining Russian Influence**: Since the war, there's a growing sense that Moscow's long-standing influence over Central Asia is declining rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. Kazakhstan, despite being a member of the Russian-led Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), has avoided supporting Moscow's actions in Ukraine and seems to be distancing itself from Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Similar trends have been observed in Uzbekistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. Latent tensions also exist between Russia and [[geopolitical_dynamics_involving_iran_azerbaijan_turkey_and_pakistan | Azerbaijan]] following Moscow's intervention in Nagorno-Karabakh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
*   **Concerns about China**: While many Turkic countries have close ties with Beijing, they are also nervous about China's increasing strength and influence in the region, particularly through its flagship Belt and Road Initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

These factors provide strong reasons for the Turkic countries to strengthen their cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. There's a growing awareness of the potential value of their strong [[historical_and_cultural_ties_among_turkic_states | ethnocultural ties]], despite a long history of separation between the Turkic communities in the East and the Turkish people in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

## Future Outlook
Some leading voices within the [[emergence_of_turkic_states_as_a_geopolitical_bloc | Organization of Turkic States]] have even suggested it could evolve into a political community modeled on the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. The question of leadership for such an effort is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. [[turkeys_role_in_the_turkic_states_and_geopolitical_ambitions | Turkey]], as the most populous and wealthiest member, and Recep Tayyip Erdogan, with his focus on legacy and [[turkeys_role_in_the_turkic_states_and_geopolitical_ambitions | cementing his influence as the leader of the Turkic world]], are obvious candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. However, whether other leaders would accept such a dominant role for [[turkeys_role_in_the_turkic_states_and_geopolitical_ambitions | Turkey]] remains to be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

Nevertheless, the growing ties between the Turkic states appear to be underpinned by a more tangible sense of purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. The 2022 summit and subsequent developments suggest the [[emergence_of_turkic_states_as_a_geopolitical_bloc | emergence of a new geopolitical grouping]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

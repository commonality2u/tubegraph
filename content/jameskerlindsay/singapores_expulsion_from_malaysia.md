Singapore, one of the smallest countries in the world, has emerged as a successful economic powerhouse, despite a difficult beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Its independence from Malaysia is considered one of the most interesting and unique cases of state creation in modern international politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. It is often cited as the only state to have been created by being forced out of another country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## A Unique Case of Statehood

It is widely accepted that states typically resist the loss of territory at all costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Modern international relations show very few states willing to accept the independence of a breakaway region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Instances where a country actively wants to shed part of its territory are almost unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The [[the_formation_and_dissolution_of_the_federation_of_malaysia | expulsion of Singapore from Malaysia]] in 1965 is widely regarded as the sole example of this phenomenon in modern international politics, although its straightforwardness is nuanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Singapore's Profile

Singapore is an island located just off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula in Southeast Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Its size is approximately 721 square kilometers (280 square miles), ranking it 175th out of 193 UN members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. The population currently stands at 5.45 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### [[ethnic_dynamics_in_singapore | Ethnic Dynamics]]

The population of Singapore is a diverse mixture of national groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>:
*   **Ethnic Chinese**: Approximately three-quarters of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
*   **Malays**: 15 percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   **Ethnic Indians**: 7.5 percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   **Other communities**: The remaining 1.5 percent are Europeans, Eurasians, and other groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

## Early History and British Influence

Singapore has a long history of settlement, but its modern story began in 1819 when Sir Stamford Raffles, a British official, established a trading post on the sparsely inhabited island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Its location at a crucial junction between the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean made it strategically vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Singapore later became the administrative center for other British settlements established on the Malay Peninsula along the strategically significant Strait of Malacca <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

In the following decades, Britain expanded its influence over the peninsula, with various sultanates coming under its protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. By 1895, some of these were amalgamated to form the Federated Malay States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. These existed alongside the Straits Settlements (which included Singapore) and a group of five Unfederated Malay States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

The population of Singapore grew rapidly from a few hundred in 1819 to over 10,000 within five years, reaching 225,000 by 1901 and over half a million by 1931 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. While Malay and Indian immigration contributed to this growth, ethnic Chinese formed the largest single community almost from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

## Post-WWII Reorganization and the Path to Federation

During World War II, the Malay Peninsula, including Singapore, was occupied by Japanese forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. After British rule resumed, territories were reorganized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>:
*   On April 1, 1946, Singapore became a British crown colony, separate from the Straits Settlements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   The remaining Straits Settlements, Federated, and Unfederated Malay States were amalgamated to form the Federation of Malaya on February 1, 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

This reorganization placed Singapore administratively and geographically apart from the Malay Peninsula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Over the next decade and a half, Singapore gained greater self-rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. With British decolonization in full swing, questions arose about Singapore's future, especially after the Federation of Malaya gained independence on August 31, 1957 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

Many in Singapore believed its place was within the newly independent Federation, feeling that a small island couldn't survive independently, despite little obvious economic advantage to the union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Conversely, leaders in the Federation were cautious, concerned about Singapore's larger population potentially leading to 3.6 million Chinese outnumbering 3.4 million Malays in a united country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

Wider political concerns, including an ongoing communist insurgency, eventually persuaded the Federation's leaders, as there was fear that Singapore might be overrun without protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## The Formation of Malaysia

In April 1961, Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's Prime Minister, proposed the creation of a new state: Malaysia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. This proposed federation would include the Federation of Malaya, Singapore, and three British territories on Borneo: Brunei, Sarawak, and North Borneo (Sabah) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

Seven months later, in November 1961, the creation of the Federation of Malaysia was agreed upon after consultations with the British Government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

On September 1, 1962, a controversial referendum was held in Singapore, offering voters three choices on the *form* of integration, but not on the merger itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Voters chose "considerable autonomy" over a complete and unconditional merger or a merger on equal terms to other new entrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

The details of the union were outlined in the following year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. Singapore would be represented in the federal administration, contribute to the state budget, and a common market would be established to ensure open trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

On August 31, 1963, British rule officially ended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. On September 16, Singapore became one of the 14 states of the newly created Federation of Malaysia, alongside Sabah and Sarawak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Brunei, which was initially intended to join, opted to remain a British protectorate until its independence in 1984 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

## Difficulties within the Federation

From the outset, the union proved to be a difficult relationship, both economically and politically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Significant differences between the two entities were magnified after Singapore's entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>:
*   Singapore was unhappy with the failure to implement the common market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   Malaysia felt Singapore was not meeting its financial obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   Malaysia's political leadership was angered when Singapore's ruling People's Action Party contested seats in Malaysia during the April 1964 general election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. This was seen by the United Malays National Organisation, the dominant party in the rest of the Federation, as an encroachment on their political territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

Against this backdrop, [[ethnic_dynamics_in_singapore | ethnic tensions]] grew between Malays and Chinese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. This culminated in rioting in Singapore in July and September 1964, resulting in 36 deaths and over 550 injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

By the end of 1964, relations between politicians and people of Singapore and the rest of Malaysia were under intolerable strain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Malaysian Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman made it clear that if Singapore's politicians continued on their path, the only route was for Singapore to leave the Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. He later proposed a confederation where Singapore would have full autonomy except for defence and foreign policy, in return for giving up its seats in the Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>, but discussions on this looser arrangement failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

## The Separation

By July 1965, Rahman decided that the only remaining option was to force Singapore out of the Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. While this had the potential for major complications if Singapore refused, Singapore's Prime Minister, Lee Kuan Yew, had also concluded that separation was the only viable way out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

Top-secret talks were held on the terms of the "divorce," with many government members in both Malaysia and Singapore kept in the dark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. Weeks later, a deal was reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

On the morning of August 9, 1965, less than two years after joining Malaysia, a law for Singapore's separation was unanimously passed by the Malaysian parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. This move surprised ordinary Malaysians and Singaporeans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. Rahman took direct personal responsibility, stating it was the only choice for peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. At the same time, a visibly upset Lee Kuan Yew broke down as he declared Singapore's independence, promising a calm, multi-ethnic state with nothing to fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

Six weeks later, on September 21, 1965, the Republic of Singapore became the 117th member of the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

## Aftermath and Legacy

The separation was initially widely regarded as a temporary measure based on political differences, not a permanent parting driven by fundamental incompatibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. The door for eventual reunification was left open, with many seeing it as inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. Rahman noted Singapore would be welcomed back and later expressed regret at its departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Lee Kuan Yew also expressed regret and suggested it would be up to the next generation to bring about reunification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

However, reunification never happened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. Nearly 60 years later, there is no organized movement for reunification, though the idea is occasionally floated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. Despite the circumstances, there was a persistent sense that Singapore's place was within the wider union of territories that formed Malaysia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

While states generally try to hold onto land, [[the_formation_and_dissolution_of_the_federation_of_malaysia | Malaysia's decision to expel Singapore]] was a unique case of a country willing to be rid of a "troublesome territory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Singapore's incorporation into Malaysia was never entirely comfortable, with fundamental political and economic differences quickly making the union difficult for both parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. Ultimately, the situation was resolved peacefully and relatively easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

Contrary to the perception of a dramatic expulsion, Singapore was ready to accept the decision and go its own way, making the event more akin to a "consensual mutual succession" rather than a forced expulsion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. This raises fascinating questions about situations where a state attempts to expel a territory that does not wish to accept independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

The [[potential_for_peaceful_versus_military_resolution_in_transnistria | future of Transnistria]] and [[MoldovaTransnistria relations | its relationship with Moldova]] have come under intense scrutiny due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine [00:00:00]. This situation has raised important questions about potential outcomes for the long-standing dispute [00:01:21].

### Potential Scenarios for Transnistria

The war in Ukraine has unsettled the previously "frozen" conflict in [[Transnistria and its geopolitical significance | Transnistria]] [00:06:09]. Several scenarios are being considered for its future:

#### 1. Russian Invasion or Annexation

There has been growing speculation that Russian forces attempting to take control of southern Ukraine might try to link up with the 1,500 Russian troops already stationed in [[Russian influence and military presence in Transnistria | Transnistria]] [00:00:54]. This could be a prelude to an attack on western Ukraine or an attempt to take control of Moldova [00:01:00]. These fears were fueled by images from Belarus allegedly showing Russian plans to attack Transnistria and comments from a Russian general, though Russia strongly denied the claim [00:01:06].

If Russia were to invade, it would likely recognize Transnistria as independent, potentially followed by annexation, similar to Crimea and other areas in southern Ukraine [00:06:30]. This would be a worrying development, transforming Transnistria from a Russian-occupied de facto state to annexed Russian territory [00:06:45]. Such a move could profoundly impact Transnistria's population, potentially cutting them off from Moldova and the wider world, leading to an exodus of Moldovans and Ukrainians, leaving mainly Russians [00:06:55]. However, the international community would still regard Transnistria as part of Moldova, meaning the conflict would officially remain unresolved [00:07:13]. This might leave the door open for an eventual settlement in a post-Putin era, though any changes on the ground would become more entrenched over time [00:07:26].

#### 2. Moldovan Attempt to Retake Transnistria by Force

With Russia engaged in Ukraine, retaking Transnistria by force might seem like an opportune moment for Moldova, and there might be little international opposition [00:07:45]. However, this scenario is highly unlikely [00:08:01]. The Moldovan government has publicly committed to a peaceful resolution [00:08:05], and its army is small and poorly equipped, making it unlikely to succeed against even a relatively weak Russian force in Transnistria [00:08:11].

Furthermore, such an attempt could escalate tensions with Moscow in devastating ways, potentially leading to Russian airstrikes on Moldovan cities and civilian targets [00:08:24]. Moldova's options for outside help are limited; neighboring Romania, a NATO member, cannot directly intervene as it would risk a serious confrontation between Russia and the West [00:08:43].

#### 3. Ukrainian Attack on Russian Forces in Transnistria

Ukraine might launch an attack on Russian forces in Transnistria to secure its southwestern flank [00:09:05]. This could happen if Transnistria appears to be preparing to join an attack on Ukraine [00:09:13]. This scenario could be a significant, unexpected surprise of the Ukraine War [00:09:22].

#### 4. Negotiated Settlement

Pushing for a negotiated settlement is another option, though it appears difficult to achieve while the war in Ukraine continues [00:09:33]. Transnistrian leaders are unlikely to abandon their claim to independence as long as there is hope of Russian support, and Russia's military presence would prevent them from negotiating independently [00:09:41].

However, if the war goes badly for Russia, and Moscow can no longer provide political, military, or financial support to Transnistria, the situation could change [00:09:56]. Even then, reaching a deal would be challenging, as it's unclear if Moldova would offer significant autonomy or a federal settlement to a weakened Transnistria [00:10:06].

#### 5. Moldova Accepting Transnistria's Independence

Some have suggested that Moldova might consider ditching the problem altogether and accepting Transnistria's independence, though this is extremely unlikely as states rarely voluntarily cede territory [00:10:24]. Despite this, it is a private consideration among some Moldovans, as is common in secessionist conflicts [00:10:34].

Such a move could offer advantages, including ending a long-running dispute [00:10:46] and potentially opening other options for Moldova, such as easier European Union membership [00:10:53]. It could even open the door to NATO membership, though this is currently off the table due to Moldova's constitutional commitment to neutrality [00:10:57]. Union with neighboring Romania could also become achievable if desired [00:11:05].

However, accepting Transnistria's independence carries major problems. Approximately a third of Transnistria's population is Moldovan, making it difficult for Moldova to abandon them [00:11:14]. There are also significant [[implications_of_transnistrias_status_for_moldova_and_international_relations | wider geopolitical complications]]. An independent Transnistria could become another Russian client state squeezed between Ukraine and Moldova [00:11:31]. It might even decide to unite with Russia, becoming a Russian exclave similar to Kaliningrad [00:11:39]. Given Russia's strong presence, it seems unlikely that an independent Transnistria would develop closer relations with the West [00:11:52].

### Continued Frozen Conflict

Despite the tumultuous events in Ukraine, the possibility remains that [[impact_of_the_ukraine_war_on_transnistria | Transnistria]] could simply remain a frozen conflict [00:12:01]. Instead of a resolution through peace or force, the status quo might continue, albeit within a new geopolitical context of an extremely tense relationship between Russia and the West [00:12:11]. The future of Transnistria, and Moldova more generally, could well depend on the course of the ongoing war in Ukraine [00:12:25].

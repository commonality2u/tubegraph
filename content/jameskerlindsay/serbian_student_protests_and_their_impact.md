Since November 2024, [[possibility_of_serbian_government_collapse | large-scale student protests]] have drawn tens of thousands to the streets of Serbia, demanding political change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. These demonstrations, sparked by a tragic incident in Novi Sad, have already led to high-profile resignations, including the Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Many are now questioning whether the protests could force long-standing President Aleksandar Vučić from power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Historical Context

Serbia, a landlocked country in Southeastern Europe, sits at the crossroads of Central Europe and the Balkans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Its history includes a medieval kingdom, Ottoman rule, regained independence in 1878, and a central role in the creation of Yugoslavia after World War I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

### Post-Yugoslavia and Milošević Era
After the dissolution of Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia following Josip Broz Tito's death in 1980, economic difficulties and rising nationalism led to Slobodan Milošević's rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. As head of the Serbian Communist Party, he became president in 1989, championing Serbian nationalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. His actions deepened ethnic divisions, contributing to the collapse of the federation and the subsequent Yugoslav Wars starting in 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Sanctions were imposed on Serbia due to its role in the wars, leading to economic collapse and growing dissent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. After NATO's bombing of Serbia in 1999 following fighting in [[kosovo_issue_and_its_impact_on_serbias_foreign_policy | Kosovo]], Milošević was forced from power in 2000 by mass protests after refusing to acknowledge defeat in a presidential election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

### Post-Milošević Instability
Following Milošević's downfall, Serbia struggled with [[history_of_political_instability_in_serbia | political instability]] despite moving towards democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. This period saw political infighting, economic challenges, and the 2003 assassination of reformist Prime Minister Zoran Đinđić <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. While European integration was pursued, nationalist parties retained significant support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Public disillusionment with the Democratic Party, which promoted reform but delivered few tangible results, and a growing weariness of radical extremism after [[kosovo_issue_and_its_impact_on_serbias_foreign_policy | Kosovo's declaration of independence]] in 2008, paved the way for a new political leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

## Rise of Aleksandar Vučić

Aleksandar Vučić, who previously served as Milošević’s Minister for Information and had a staunch nationalist reputation, rebranded himself as a pro-European reformer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. In early 2008, he co-founded the Serbian Progressive Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. He became Deputy Prime Minister in 2012, Prime Minister in 2014, and was elected president in 2017, consolidating his power to become the undisputed leader of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. He secured a second five-year presidential term in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

### Vučić's Administration: Divided Opinions
Under Vučić, Serbia has undergone significant transformation, though opinions are divided on whether it's for the better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

*   **Supporters** highlight significant economic growth, major infrastructure projects (roads, railways), and increased [[impacts_of_foreign_investment_on_serbia | foreign investment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
*   **Opponents** accuse Vučić of rolling back democratic freedoms, suppressing media, manipulating elections, and using state resources for political patronage, leading to rampant corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. They also argue his pursuit of foreign investment has caused significant environmental damage, citing the Belgrade waterfront development and proposed lithium mining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

Opposition parties claim that international partners, including the EU and US, have been complicit by prioritizing stability over democracy, making it impossible to work through normal democratic channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. This has led to frequent mass protests over the past decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

## The Current Protests

The current wave of protests began on November 1, 2024, after a newly reconstructed canopy at Novi Sad railway station collapsed, killing 15 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. Many immediately attributed the tragedy to corruption, blaming poor workmanship by the Chinese consortium and inadequate safety inspections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

The incident led to the resignation of the transport minister and the arrest of over a dozen officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. However, it was seen as symbolic of deep-rooted mismanagement within the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Students began protesting, demanding justice, greater transparency, and increased government spending on infrastructure and education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

Despite attempts to suppress them, the demonstrations spread across the country, attracting farmers, academics, and lawyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. In January 2025, thousands of students marched 80 km from Novi Sad to Belgrade, blocking key highways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Tens of thousands continue to rally, making this the most significant unrest in Serbia since Milošević's fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

## Impact and Future

The protests have raised questions about the future of the government and President Vučić <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

### Student Objectives
The students are not explicitly trying to bring down the government, instead focusing on more profound changes to the Serbian political system and avoiding direct engagement with opposition parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

### Vučić's Position
President Vučić remains defiant, claiming the protests are not a reflection of popular will but are stirred up by foreign forces aiming to undermine Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. His supporters insist he enjoys significant national popularity beyond the urban centers of Belgrade and Novi Sad, where many ordinary Serbs believe he has overseen economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. The lack of a coherent, credible opposition also works in his favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

### Government Response and Outlook
The administration is clearly concerned, making concessions and accepting resignations, including that of Prime Minister Miloš Vučević and Novi Sad's mayor on January 28 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. Evidence suggests the protests are growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. Past experience in Serbia shows that popular protest can force leaders from power, providing an incentive for the protesters to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

The situation is described as a "battle of wills" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. If demonstrations continue to grow and spread, the pressure on the government could become too much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. Escalation could also occur if serious violence erupts, especially if provoked by the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. While Vučić has experience tackling widespread protests and his position may seem secure for now, history demonstrates that such pressure is "bearable—until it isn’t" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

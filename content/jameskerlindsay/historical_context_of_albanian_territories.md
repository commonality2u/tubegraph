Recent discussions have reignited the idea of [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | Kosovo and Albania]] uniting, with two former prime ministers of Kosovo openly supporting the concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. While the logic behind such a move is understandable, it faces significant obstacles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Kosovo's Status and Unification Talks
Kosovo declared its independence in February 2008, a move that divided international opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. The United States and most of the European Union recognized its independence, but countries like Russia and China have steadfastly opposed its statehood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. As a result, 13 years after separating from Serbia, Kosovo remains outside the United Nations and its aspirations for European Union membership are on hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

Against this backdrop, senior Kosovan political figures have increasingly discussed the option of [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | unification with neighboring Albania]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Albin Kurti, leader of Vetëvendosje and recent election winner in Kosovo, supports the idea and would vote for unification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Ramush Haradinaj, a former prime minister, suggested that if Kosovo's European integration hopes remain blocked, a referendum on unification might be the only choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. However, this suggestion carries many legal and political implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## Geographical and Demographic Context
[[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | Kosovo and Albania]] are located in Southeast Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   **Albania**: Approximately 29,000 square kilometers (11,000 square miles), making it the 140th largest UN member, similar in size to Belgium or Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Its population is 2.9 million, with the vast majority being ethnic Albanian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Greeks are the largest ethnic minority, comprising 1-2% of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Kosovo**: About 11,000 square kilometers (4,200 square miles), roughly a third the size of Albania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Its population is 1.8 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. The most recent census showed 93% of Kosovo's population is ethnic Albanian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. The remaining 7% are predominantly Serbs, along with Montenegrins, Bosniaks, Roma, and other groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Both countries have significant diaspora populations abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Historical Context
### Formation of Albania (1913)
The historical narrative largely begins in 1913 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. The Treaties of London and Bucharest demarcated the borders of a new Albanian state, alongside several other neighboring countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. However, this did not unite all Albanians in the region; almost half found themselves living outside the new Principality of Albania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. The largest concentration of these Albanians was in the Kingdom of Serbia, which then included most of what is now Kosovo and North Macedonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Others were in Montenegro and Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Consequently, Albanians in Albania and those elsewhere began to follow very different paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

### Communist Era and Yugoslav Disintegration
In 1918, Serbia and Montenegro became part of what would become Yugoslavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. After World War II, both Albania and Yugoslavia came under communist rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. Though relations were initially good, they soon deteriorated, especially after Albania adopted an extreme isolationist regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

This changed in 1991 with the collapse of communism in Albania and the disintegration of socialist Yugoslavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. This period allowed for increased contact between Albania and Albanian communities across the region, but political union remained elusive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

### Post-Yugoslav Independence and Kosovo
In late 1991, Macedonia (now North Macedonia) gained independence, placing half a million Albanians—the second-largest Albanian community outside Albania—within a new country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. A small Albanian community also found itself in an independent Montenegro in 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

The most significant development, however, was Kosovo's attempt to break away from Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Kosovo was home to the largest ethnic Albanian community outside of Albania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Following an escalation of fighting, NATO intervened in March 1999, leading to the province being placed under United Nations administration while its final status was decided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. After failed UN talks, Kosovo unilaterally declared independence in February 2008, supported by the United States and most of the EU, but opposed by Serbia, Russia, and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. Since then, over half of UN members have recognized it as an independent state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

## Reasons for Unification Discussions
Several reasons underpin the current discussions over [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | unification]].

### National Identity
Many view the unification of all Albanian territories—often termed 'Natural Albania' or 'Greater Albania'—as the national aspiration of the Albanian people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. However, some prefer to focus specifically on closer unity between [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | Albania and Kosovo]], given their overwhelmingly Albanian populations and shared desire to unite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama is a key proponent of this view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. In recent years, [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | Kosovo and Albania]] have moved closer politically, holding joint cabinet sessions, and Rama has appointed Kosovo Albanians to senior government positions in Albania, even floating ideas for open borders and a joint presidency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. This has led to claims of "unification by stealth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

### Practical Realities and International Deadlock
For others, the idea of unification is driven by practical concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. The pace of international recognitions for Kosovo has slowed dramatically, with only Israel recognizing it since 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Concurrently, Serbia's diplomatic campaign has led to some countries withdrawing their recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Crucially, Kosovo's path to full international acceptance, specifically UN membership, is blocked by Russia and China, with no indication of a change in their stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | Unifying with Albania]] would indirectly allow Kosovo to become a full part of the international community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

### Pressure on EU Integration
Talk of unification also serves as a strategy to pressure countries to unblock Kosovo's path to EU integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This path is stalled due to opposition from five EU members that do not recognize Kosovo, as well as general concerns about Western Balkan enlargement within certain EU quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Prominent suggestions for unification, like those from former president Hashim Thaci and former prime minister Ramush Haradinaj, directly link the idea to the EU's failure to provide Kosovo with a clear European perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

## Feasibility of Unification
Despite the talk, whether [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | unification]] could actually happen is highly questionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

### Popular Support
While initial impressions suggest popular support, a deeper look reveals a mixed picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. A 2010 poll indicated overwhelming support for 'Greater Albania' (including parts of North Macedonia), but support for a union of *just* [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | Kosovo and Albania]] dropped to 34% in Albania and 29% in Kosovo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. A more recent 2019 poll showed support at 75% in Albania and 64% in Kosovo for unification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. However, this support significantly decreased to 29% in Albania and 44% in Kosovo when people were asked if they would be willing to pay a tax to support it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. This suggests that practicalities weigh heavily on public opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Many Kosovo Albanians fear taking a secondary position to Albania as the national heartland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. The precise nature of such a union (unitary, federation, confederation) would also need to be clearly defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

### Legal and Political Obstacles
Even with sufficient political and popular support, [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | unification]] appears all but impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
*   **Kosovo's Constitution**: The first article of Kosovo's constitution explicitly outlaws union with another state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. While constitutional amendments are possible, this would require a two-thirds vote in the 120-member Kosovo parliament, *and* two-thirds support from the 20 members representing national minorities (10 of whom are ethnic Serbs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. It is considered implausible that any of the Serb representatives, or even a majority of minority deputies, would vote for [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | unification with Albania]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. From this perspective alone, the answer to whether they could unite is a clear "no" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

*   **International Opposition**: If, hypothetically, the constitutional hurdles were overcome, the international community would strongly oppose it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.
    *   For countries that do not recognize Kosovo's independence, such a move would be seen as an unlawful violation of Serbia's territorial integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.
    *   For countries that *have* recognized Kosovo, while normally the democratic will of sovereign states would be respected, the wider context is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. The primary fear is that [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | unification]] would trigger a chain reaction across the Western Balkans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. This could lead to demands for unification from Albanians in North Macedonia, and if Albanians are granted this right, it could spur similar calls from Serbs in the region, posing challenges to Bosnia and Montenegro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. Countries supporting Kosovo's independence did so on the explicit understanding that it would be the final redrawing of borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. Therefore, any attempt at [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | unification]] would face immense pressure from the United States and the European Union on Pristina and Tirana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

## Conclusion
While recent suggestions of a vote on [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | unification between Kosovo and Albania]] have garnered international attention, it seems highly unlikely to occur in the foreseeable future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. Beyond constitutional blockages, any attempt would face fierce opposition from the broader international community, including both states that recognize and those that do not recognize Kosovo's independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. This talk is primarily a strategy to encourage greater international engagement to break the deadlock over Kosovo's international standing as an independent state, rather than a genuine effort to relinquish that independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. However, the longer Kosovo remains in limbo, the louder these calls for unification may grow, potentially tempting politicians to act despite the consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

From: [[jameskerlindsay]] <br/> 

Under its current president, [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]], Turkey has sought to reestablish its standing among the world's Muslim-majority states and shape broader opinion on critical issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This has led to questions about whether Turkey is becoming the leader of the Islamic world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Erdoğan has even called for an Islamic alliance against Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Defining International Leadership

In international relations, leadership can be exerted through military or economic power, but it also extends to political, diplomatic, or cultural influence, known as "soft power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. A leader can shape development by setting policies, building coalitions, and shaping institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The question of who leads the Islamic world is particularly interesting given its significant global population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### The Islamic World: Scope and Divisions

Islam is the world's second-largest religion, with an estimated 1.8 billion adherents, projected to surpass Christianity by the end of the century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), representing Muslim-majority countries, has 57 full members and five observers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Its members span five continents, representing about 25% of the world's population and landmass, and around 10% of the global economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Despite the traditional idea of a single religious community (the *ummah*), these countries are often deeply divided politically, culturally, ideologically, and economically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## [[turkeys_historical_connection_with_the_muslim_world | Turkey's Historical Connection with the Muslim World]]

Turkey and the Turkish people have a long history at the heart of the Muslim faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. Islam spread into Central Asia where Turkic tribes converted to the faith in the 11th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### Rise of the Ottoman Empire

One Turkic tribe, the Seljuks, conquered Baghdad in 1055, the cultural and political center of the Caliphate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. In 1071, they defeated the Byzantine Empire, paving the way for other Muslim Turkic tribes to settle in the Anatolian Peninsula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Three centuries later, the Ottomans began a rapid campaign of conquest, sweeping away the last remnants of the Byzantine Empire and conquering much of Southeast Europe and the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Having become the most powerful force in the Islamic world, the Ottoman Sultan also took the title of Caliph, signifying his leadership of the faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

### Secularization Under Atatürk

By the late 19th century, the Ottoman Empire was in decline, and its final blow came after the First World War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. After its defeat, Turkish nationalist forces, led by General Mustafa Kemal (Atatürk), fought back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. The Republic of Turkey replaced the Ottoman Empire, the last Sultan was forced to abdicate, and the Caliphate was abolished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

Atatürk subsequently rid the new state of its old ties to Islam, abolishing the Ottoman Arabic script, replacing it with Latin characters, and introducing a strict separation between religion and state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. At this time, Turkey broke off ties with the Middle East and the broader Islamic world, prioritizing its Western and [[turkeys_historical_orientation_towards_europe | European orientation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Turkey joined NATO in 1952 and signed an association agreement with the European Economic Community (forerunner of the EU) ten years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Notably, Turkey also became the first Muslim-majority state to recognize Israel, forging a close defense and security alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

## [[turkeys_geopolitical_strategies_and_alliances | Erdoğan's Reorientation and Assertiveness]]

Everything began to change around the turn of the millennium, as Turkey faced economic and political turmoil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. The Justice and Development Party (AKP) emerged, led by Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, a former mayor of Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. In November 2002, the AKP won national elections, and Erdoğan became Prime Minister the following year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

### Domestic and Foreign Policy Shifts

From the start, Erdoğan signaled his intention to reorient Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Domestically, he began to roll back restrictions on religion in public life, highlighting his own religious faith, ending the ban on headscarves in government offices, and reducing the military's power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

Concurrently, he steadily reoriented the country's foreign policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. While maintaining ties to NATO and the quest to join the European Union, Turkey increased its profile across the Middle East and the broader Muslim world, significantly expanding its diplomatic presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. The Directorate of Religious Affairs increased overseas aid, building mosques and religious schools, promoting Islamic cultural programs, and distributing humanitarian assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

Turkey has also become a more active military and security actor, playing a role in Somalia and intervening in Libya, Syria, and Iraq <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. It has also become an increasingly significant voice in the OIC, with a Turkish Secretary General from 2005-2013 and holding the chairmanship from 2016-2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

### Outspoken Positions on Key Issues

Turkey has become increasingly outspoken on issues that resonate with many ordinary Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. During the Arab Spring in 2010, Erdoğan supported efforts to overthrow authoritarian secular regimes in Egypt and Syria, publicly backing Islamist opposition groups. This move fundamentally undermined Ankara's relationship with Cairo and Damascus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

Perhaps most significantly, Erdoğan became a vocal supporter of the [[turkeys_role_in_syria_and_its_effects_on_relations_with_israel | Palestinian cause]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. Turkey's long-standing relationship with Israel collapsed in 2010 after an Israeli raid on a Turkish aid ship to Gaza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. Erdoğan's continued support for the Palestinian cause gained traction as more Arab states normalized relations with Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. While there were signs of rapprochement in 2022, the relationship worsened again since the war in Gaza, with Erdoğan publicly sympathizing with Hamas and Hezbollah, accusing Israel of genocide, and calling for an Islamic alliance against Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

## Arguments for Turkey's Leadership Potential

Several factors suggest Turkey's potential for leadership in the Muslim world:

*   **Demographics:** Turkey is the world's sixth most populous Muslim-majority state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   **Economy:** With an annual GDP of $1 trillion, it is the third-largest economically after Indonesia and Saudi Arabia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
*   **Military:** Its military spending ranks second only to Saudi Arabia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
*   **Growing Presence:** It has a steadily growing diplomatic, military, and aid presence across the Muslim world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
*   **Soft Power:** Turkish Airlines has rapidly grown, and Istanbul has become the world's most connected airport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. Turkish television programs have a following in many Muslim countries, and its active tourist market attracts around 45 million visitors annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Turkish history and culture are also strongly promoted internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
*   **Erdoğan's Stance:** Erdoğan's outspoken positions on key issues further boost Turkey's standing in the Muslim world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

## [[challenges_facing_turkeys_leadership_ambitions | Challenges to Formal Leadership]]

Despite these strengths, there are significant reasons why Turkey may not translate its growing influence into formal political leadership:

*   **Distrust in the Arab World:** Turkey remains deeply distrusted in large parts of the Arab world, stemming from the bitter experience of 300 years of Ottoman colonial rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. Many Arab states view Turkey and its leader with deep suspicion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.
*   **Bilateral Tensions:** Turkey has had deep bilateral tensions with states like Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. While Turkey is attempting to rebuild ties, many countries will not forget its past behavior or its perceived ability to change positions and turn on allies with ease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.
*   **Multi-alignment Suspicion:** Many are suspicious of Turkey's attempts to maintain ties with multiple, sometimes conflicting, blocs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. It courts Muslim states while being in a military alliance with the West (NATO), talks about joining BRICS, tries to lead the [[turkeys_role_in_the_turkic_states_and_geopolitical_ambitions | Turkic states]], and at the same time is [[turkeys_foreign_relations_with_russia_and_the_west | cozying up to Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. Critics view this as proof of Erdoğan's inability to be loyal to any group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   **Strong Competition:** Turkey faces strong competition from other influential states in the Muslim world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>:
    *   **Saudi Arabia:** Remains incredibly influential as the birthplace of Islam and home to its holiest sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.
    *   **Egypt:** Remains a demographic and cultural powerhouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
    *   **Indonesia:** The world's most populous Muslim state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.
    *   **Pakistan:** Also a significant Muslim-majority state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
    *   **Gulf States:** Qatar and the United Arab Emirates have emerged as hugely influential actors, supported by considerable oil wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
    *   **Iran:** Remains the preeminent actor for many Shia Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

## Conclusion

While Turkey has undoubtedly reestablished its standing in the Muslim world under Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and has taken a strident position on Israel, it seems unlikely to become the overarching leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. There are too many opposed to its leadership and too many alternative challengers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. Instead, Turkey is better understood as one influential country among many within the large and highly diverse group of Muslim-majority states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.

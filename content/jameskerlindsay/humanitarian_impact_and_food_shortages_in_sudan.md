As international attention largely remains on other global conflicts, fears are growing about the deteriorating situation in [[sudan_civil_war_and_humanitarian_crisis|Sudan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The country is rapidly becoming the world's worst [[sudan_civil_war_and_humanitarian_crisis|humanitarian crisis]] due to a fierce [[recent_fighting_in_sudans_potential_new_civil_war|civil war]] that has dramatically escalated over the past year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Despite millions displaced and many facing starvation, many observers now refer to it as a "forgotten war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Escalation of the Humanitarian Crisis

While the outbreak of the [[recent_fighting_in_sudans_potential_new_civil_war|civil war]] initially received considerable media coverage, the situation is now receiving almost no international attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. However, the situation on the ground has continued to worsen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. In addition to ongoing battles in the capital, Khartoum, fighting has spread to other parts of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. As the [[recent_fighting_in_sudans_potential_new_civil_war|civil war]] continues, it has resulted in at least 14,000 deaths and tens of thousands wounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

## Mass Displacement and Refugee Crisis

The broader effects of the conflict are now the greatest cause for concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   **Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs)**: Approximately 6.3 million people are estimated to be internally displaced within [[sudan_civil_war_and_humanitarian_crisis|Sudan]], giving the country the highest number of IDPs globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
*   **Refugees**: An additional 1.7 million people are believed to have fled the country, becoming refugees in neighboring states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

## Severe Food Shortages and Starvation

Serious food shortages are a particularly worrying aspect of the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. With an almost complete breakdown of law and order and central government services, [[sudan_civil_war_and_humanitarian_crisis|Sudan]] stands on the brink of starvation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

> "Altogether, the United Nations estimates that around half the country's population, approximately 25 million people, now need life-saving assistance, including 14 million children." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>

These figures are projected to increase in the coming months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

## Exacerbating Factors

Several other factors have worsened the situation:
*   **Red Sea Shipping Disruptions**: Growing attacks on Red Sea shipping by Houthi forces in Yemen have severely curtailed the number of ships able to reach Port [[sudan_civil_war_and_humanitarian_crisis|Sudan]], the country's main outlet to the sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. This has limited the influx of food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.
*   **Regional Famines**: The wider region has faced severe famines in recent years, leading to lingering food shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

Combined with the ongoing [[recent_fighting_in_sudans_potential_new_civil_war|civil war]], [[sudan_civil_war_and_humanitarian_crisis|Sudan]] is on course to become the world's worst hunger crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. There are also growing fears about the worsening situation in Darfur, where horrific acts of violence are being reported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

## Lack of International Attention

Despite the UN calling for $4.1 billion USD to help deal with the crisis as the conflict approaches its second year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>, the organization's Under-Secretary-General, Martin Griffiths, has noted that it has been "extraordinarily difficult" to get the international community to focus on [[sudan_civil_war_and_humanitarian_crisis|Sudan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. This lack of focus is partly due to international attention remaining firmly on Gaza and Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.

> "The tragic reality is that with international attention still firmly focused on Gaza and Ukraine, the world is paying precious little attention to this vast unfolding disaster in Africa." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>

Initial international attention on the [[recent_fighting_in_sudans_potential_new_civil_war|fighting in Sudan]] was considerable, partly due to the large number of foreigners caught in the situation, forcing evacuations by multiple countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Broader political and strategic factors, such as the country's position on the Red Sea and its role as a conduit between North and Sub-Saharan Africa, also initially attracted attention, as did the factional links to Russia and the West, giving the conflict an international policy and media dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. However, once foreigners were out, news coverage and policy attention soon dwindled, especially after the surge in Middle East violence in October 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

In January 2020, [[britains_exit_from_the_european_union | Britain]] officially left the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While initially seen by many as an opportunity for independent global standing, the promised benefits of the Leave campaign have largely not materialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Instead, there's growing evidence of severe economic damage, leading to public opinion shifting against the decision and an increasing openness to rejoining the EU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Britain's Deep European Roots

[[britains_exit_from_the_european_union | Britain's]] relationship with Europe is founded on a long history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. The British people have been shaped by numerous waves of immigration from the continent, including the Celts, Romans, Saxons, Vikings, Danes, Normans, and Huguenots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Over centuries, [[britains_exit_from_the_european_union | Britain]] has been intricately linked to the continent politically, economically, militarily, and socially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Post-War European Integration and British Ambivalence

The modern story of this relationship begins on July 23, 1952 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. As Europe recovered from the Second World War, initial steps were taken to redefine the relationship between France and Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Recognizing that economic interdependence could prevent future conflicts, the European Coal and Steel Community was established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. This was followed by the Treaty of Rome on March 25, 1957, which created the European Economic Community (EEC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Built on the principle of an "ever-closer union," the EEC eventually evolved into the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

From the outset, [[britains_exit_from_the_european_union | Britain]] showed ambivalence towards this European integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. While acknowledging the benefits of cooperation and being a founder member of the Council of Europe (the continent's leading human rights body), [[britains_exit_from_the_european_union | Britain]] maintained distance from the EC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Instead, it focused on rebuilding post-war ties with its Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## Joining the EEC

By the early 1960s, [[britains_exit_from_the_european_union | Britain's]] global standing had changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. With the Cold War and decolonization underway, it had lost its preeminent international position and was falling behind Western Europe economically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. In 1961, [[britains_exit_from_the_european_union | Britain]] made the significant decision to apply to join the EEC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. However, this application, and a subsequent one, were rejected by French President Charles de Gaulle, who believed [[britains_exit_from_the_european_union | Britain]] would undermine the Community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. French leadership changed by the early 1970s, and on January 1, 1973, the UK finally joined, alongside Ireland and Denmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## A Complicated Membership

From the beginning, the relationship was complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Unlike its continental European counterparts, [[britains_exit_from_the_european_union | Britain's]] primary motivation for joining was economic benefits, not political integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Although membership was overwhelmingly endorsed in a 1975 referendum, tensions grew by the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. While [[britains_exit_from_the_european_union | Britain]] played a leading role in forming the Single Market, a landmark project for open trade across Europe, a funding dispute led to the UK securing an unpopular rebate on its contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. The Conservative government under Margaret Thatcher also became increasingly opposed to calls for greater political integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

Despite a seemingly pro-European stance by the new Labour government under Tony Blair in the late 1990s, little was done to address deep-rooted hostility towards Europe in the media or promote a positive message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. The government also opted out of major European projects, such as the single currency (the euro) and Schengen, which aimed to create a border-free Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

## The Road to Brexit

When the Conservatives returned to power in 2010, the European debate was initially sidelined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. However, a significant portion of the party remained staunchly against [[britains_exit_from_the_european_union | Britain's]] EU membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. This came to a head in 2014 following a disastrous result in European parliamentary elections, where the anti-European UK Independence Party (UKIP) gained significant support by campaigning on European immigration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. In response, Prime Minister David Cameron pledged a referendum on membership if the Conservatives won the next election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

After a surprise victory in 2015, and negotiations to amend the terms of [[britains_exit_from_the_european_union | Britain's]] membership (including a formal commitment that [[britains_exit_from_the_european_union | Britain]] would never be bound by an "ever-closer union" or required to join the euro), the country entered a highly divisive debate over EU membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

### The Referendum Campaign

The Remain campaign focused on the economic benefits of EU membership, warning of disastrous consequences if [[britains_exit_from_the_european_union | Britain]] left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. The Leave campaign, fighting a controversial campaign, dismissed these warnings and instead focused on issues of sovereignty and limiting immigration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. It argued that [[Brexits influence on the unification debate | Brexit]], as the departure became known, would restore the country's independence and allow more money for public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

On June 23, 2016, the UK voted to leave the European Union by a margin of 52 to 48 percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

## Brexit and Its Aftermath

Immediately after the vote, the country was plunged into another debate about the form [[Brexits influence on the unification debate | Brexit]] would take <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. While many advocated for [[britains_exit_from_the_european_union | Britain]] to remain part of the Single Market, the political unacceptability of allowing European workers continued free movement into [[britains_exit_from_the_european_union | Britain]] led the government to pursue a "hard [[Brexits influence on the unification debate | Brexit]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. This involved cutting ties to all parts and institutions of the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

After triggering Article 50, the EU treaty clause allowing a country to leave, negotiations took several years and were marked by considerable acrimony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. The process also created severe problems in Northern Ireland, where EU membership had underpinned the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which ended a long-standing conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Despite these challenges, a deal was reached by the end of 2019, and the United Kingdom formally left the European Union on January 31, 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

### Consequences of Brexit

Since leaving, it has become clear that [[Brexits influence on the unification debate | Brexit]] has not delivered on the Leave campaign's promises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. [[britains_exit_from_the_european_union | Britain]] has experienced a significant economic downturn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. While some attribute the worst effects to the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine, the Office for Budget Responsibility estimates that [[Brexits influence on the unification debate | Brexit]] has led to a four percent drop in British gross domestic product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Additionally, a shortage of EU workers has contributed to rising inflation, leading to interest rate increases and impacting the cost of living and mortgage payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

New rules have made trade extremely difficult for many sectors, particularly agriculture and fishing, which had largely favored leaving the EU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Although the government has pursued new trade deals with other countries, these have offered minimal benefits and do not offset the cost of [[Brexits influence on the unification debate | Brexit]] to trade with the European Union, the UK's largest market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

[[Brexits influence on the unification debate | Brexit]] has also had wider adverse effects. British citizens now face greater difficulty living and working across the continent, with many countries requiring special skills or independent financial means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. Few of the promised domestic benefits, such as increased healthcare spending, have materialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This has resulted in growing public discontent, with recent polls indicating a clear majority now views [[Brexits influence on the unification debate | Brexit]] as a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

## Could Britain Rejoin the EU?

With growing dissatisfaction, questions have arisen about reversing [[Brexits influence on the unification debate | Brexit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. However, [[britains_exit_from_the_european_union | Britain]] cannot simply reverse its departure; it would need to rejoin the EU, which involves a defined two-part process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

1.  **Procedural Element:** The UK must realign itself fully with the EU's body of laws, known as the *acquis communautaire* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. This is considered the easier part, given [[britains_exit_from_the_european_union | Britain's]] long past membership and relatively few divergences since leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
2.  **Political Decision:** The more challenging aspect will be the political decision by existing member states on whether to accept [[britains_exit_from_the_european_union | Britain]] back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. While many senior European figures have expressed openness to [[britains_exit_from_the_european_union | Britain]] rejoining, leaders would need assurance of a permanent commitment to membership to avoid another exit process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

This commitment would require several factors:
*   **Unequivocal Public Commitment:** The British people must unequivocally desire membership, potentially shown by an overwhelming victory for a pro-membership party in a general election or a significant margin in a referendum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
*   **Acceptance of Core EU Projects:** In the past, [[britains_exit_from_the_european_union | Britain]] opted out of fundamental elements like the euro and Schengen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. To rejoin, the UK would need to sign up to both in principle, even if not immediately joining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. This would be a difficult pill for many in [[britains_exit_from_the_european_union | Britain]], even among those favoring rejoining, due to strong commitment to the pound and the political sensitivity of borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

### Timeline for Rejoining

Even if public opinion strongly supports rejoining, it is not likely to happen anytime soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. Neither of the main political parties (Labour or Conservatives) will include rejoining in their manifestos for the next general election, due by January 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. The opposition Labour Party, currently projected to win, explicitly states its policy is to make [[Brexits influence on the unification debate | Brexit]] work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. Assuming a full five-year parliamentary term, rejoining would realistically not be on the political agenda until 2030 at the earliest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

Talks for rejoining, even with minimal divergence, would likely take at least two to three years to complete, followed by up to two more years for ratification by member states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. Under the most optimistic scenario, [[britains_exit_from_the_european_union | Britain]] would not rejoin before 2035 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

Before then, steps can be taken, such as joining EU programs and initiatives, most notably the Single Market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. While this would boost trade and the economy, it would also require a renewed commitment to freedom of movement, which may still be too politically sensitive for either party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. Ultimately, [[britains_exit_from_the_european_union | Britain]] is unlikely to be ready, able, or willing to rejoin the European Union for a considerable time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.

In October 2021, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan declared ambassadors from 10 Western countries, including the United States, France, and Germany, unwelcome in Turkey, sparking a brief diplomatic crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Although a face-saving solution was quickly found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, this incident highlighted a deeper issue that could signal the end of [[turkeys_historical_orientation_towards_europe | Turkey's century-long pivot towards Europe and the West]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The relationship between [[turkeys_relationship_with_nato_and_the_eu | Turkey and its key Western partners]] has become increasingly strained, raising questions about whether Turkey can still be considered part of the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

## Historical Orientation Towards Europe

The strategic orientation of a country is influenced by geographic, ethnic, religious, economic, political, and security factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. For Turkey, this story begins at the end of the First World War with the collapse of the Ottoman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. Turkish nationalist forces, led by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, established the Republic of Turkey, embarking on a path of modernisation and Europeanisation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. This involved pushing Islam out of the public realm and introducing the Latin alphabet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

In 1950, Turkey became a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the primary Western security body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>, and joined the Council of Europe, the continent's key human rights organisation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. A decade later, in 1963, Turkey signed an association agreement with the European Economic Community (EEC), which would later become the European Union, opening the possibility of eventual membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.

## Challenges to European Integration

Despite these initial steps, Turkey's hopes for European integration faced significant hurdles:
*   **Democratic Concerns** Several military coups raised questions about Turkey's commitment to democracy, a core requirement for EU membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.
*   **Regional Tensions** Tensions grew with EU member and fellow NATO partner Greece, particularly over Cyprus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.
*   **Perceived Religious Divide** There was a sense that Turkey, an overwhelmingly Muslim nation despite its secular nature, was being excluded from what many saw as a "Christian club" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. This perception intensified after the Cold War when the EU expanded membership to former communist countries in Central and Eastern Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.

By the late 1990s, relations between Turkey and the European Union were strained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>. Following a breakthrough in relations with Greece, Turkey finally became a candidate for EU membership in 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.

## The Erdogan Era: A Changing Path

Ironically, significant progress towards EU accession seemed to occur after the election of an overtly religious administration in November 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. The Justice and Development Party (AKP), led by Recep Tayyip Erdogan, initially viewed EU membership as a means to expand religious freedom and challenge military power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. Erdogan revitalised efforts to resolve the Cyprus issue and introduced political reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>, leading to formal EU membership discussions opening in 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.

However, Erdogan's political outlook began to shift, leading to growing autocratic tendencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>. Human rights reforms were rolled back, and media freedoms curtailed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>.
*   **2013 Gezi Park Protests** Massive protests across Turkey in May 2013 were met with a harsh crackdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.
*   **2016 Attempted Coup** An attempted military coup in 2016 led to a major purge of suspected opposition, resulting in tens of thousands of arrests and hundreds of thousands of job terminations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>.

### The Osman Kavala Case and Diplomatic Fallout

The case of Osman Kavala, a Turkish businessman and philanthropist arrested in 2017, became a focal point of Turkey's deteriorating relations with the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.
*   **ECHR Ruling** Charged with attempting to overthrow the government, Kavala's case reached the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), which ruled unanimously in December 2019 that he had been deprived of his right to liberty and timely justice, ordering his immediate release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>.
*   **Turkey's Refusal** Despite its obligation as a member of the Council of Europe to adhere to ECHR rulings, Turkey refused to release Kavala <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>.
*   **Infringement Proceedings** In September 2021, the Council of Europe announced it would begin infringement proceedings against Turkey if Kavala was not released by November, potentially leading to Turkey's suspension or expulsion from the organisation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.
*   **Ambassadors' Letter and Crisis** This led to 10 ambassadors, including those from the United States and France, signing a joint letter urging the Turkish government to abide by the Court's ruling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>. Erdogan, furious at the move, announced the ambassadors were no longer welcome in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>. The crisis was defused when the ambassadors released a statement affirming adherence to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which allowed the Turkish government to back down, claiming the countries had "learned their lesson" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>.

## Waning Western Ties and Future Uncertainties

The ambassador incident, while resolved, underscored a growing rift between [[turkeys_diplomatic_crisis_with_the_west | Turkey and its Western partners]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>.
*   **Foreign Policy Shift** Concerns have mounted over Ankara's foreign policy, especially Erdogan's close relationship with [[turkeys_evolving_foreign_relations_especially_with_russia_and_the_us | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>. Europe and the United States are increasingly presented as opponents rather than allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>.
*   **Erosion of Western Norms** Turkey's refusal to adhere to ECHR rulings demonstrates a disregard for the fundamental rules of the Western club, which are prerequisites for membership in the Council of Europe and the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>.

Most observers believe that [[turkeys_geopolitical_strategies_and_alliances | Turkey has already broken with the West]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>. The decision on a final political separation largely rests with the European Union and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>.

### Debates on Turkey's Future in the West
*   **Proponents of a Break** Argue that Turkey can no longer be considered an ally or a country sharing fundamental values. They advocate for halting EU membership talks, suspending or expelling Turkey from the Council of Europe, and even removing it from NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>.
*   **Pragmatists** Contend that EU accession talks have stalled, and Turkey is no longer a realistic candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>. They believe a complete break would worsen the situation, potentially cementing Turkey's partnership with "troublesome forces" like Russia and negatively impacting the Muslim world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:00">[10:34:00]</a>. It is better to keep Turkey in the club, even nominally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:00">[10:59:00]</a>.
*   **Optimists** Despair under Erdogan but hope Turkey may eventually return to a European path. They advocate keeping this possibility alive to encourage pro-Western forces in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:00">[11:06:00]</a>.

The prevailing view is that despite the [[challenges_facing_turkeys_leadership_ambitions | problems Turkey presents]], it is better to keep it part of the West—even in name only—than force a final split <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:00">[11:33:00]</a>. However, this argument becomes harder to sustain with every new crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:45:00">[11:45:00]</a>. The Kavala case is particularly crucial, as Turkey's continued disregard for ECHR rulings may necessitate a decision to protect the integrity of human rights in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>.

After nearly a century, the question remains whether the Turkish Republic will definitively break its relationship with the West, and if the United States and EU will allow that to happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>.

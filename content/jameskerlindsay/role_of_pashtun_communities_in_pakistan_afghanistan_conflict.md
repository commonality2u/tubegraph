The Pashtuns are a significant ethnic group whose presence across the border regions of [[pakistans_geopolitical_relations_with_afghanistan_india_iran_and_china | Pakistan]] and [[pakistans_geopolitical_relations_with_afghanistan_india_iran_and_china | Afghanistan]] plays a crucial role in the ongoing tensions and [[pakistani_taliban_attacks_and_security_challenges | conflicts]] between the two nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. Their historical division by the Durand Line and their influence on both the Afghan Taliban and the Pakistani Taliban (TTP) are central to understanding the complex [[relationship_between_pakistan_and_the_taliban_regime_in_afghanistan | relationship between Pakistan and the Taliban regime in Afghanistan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>.

## Demographics and Distribution

The Pashtuns are a key group in the region, speaking a language related to Iranian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. They are spread across Southern Afghanistan and the West and Northwest of Pakistan, numbering approximately 50 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. In Afghanistan, Pashtuns represent about half of the country's inhabitants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. In Pakistan, they constitute 15% of the population, making them the second-largest group after the Punjabis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. Both countries are predominantly Sunni Muslim, but ethnically diverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

## Historical Context and the Durand Line

The [[historical_context_of_pakistan_and_afghanistan_relations | historical context of Pakistan and Afghanistan relations]] is deeply intertwined with the Pashtun question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. In 1893, after Britain's continued push into Afghanistan, the British formally defined their border along the **Durand Line** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. This boundary divided traditional Pashtun lands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

From the inception of Pakistan in 1947, [[pakistans_geopolitical_relations_with_afghanistan_india_iran_and_china | Afghanistan]] strained relations by questioning the borders of the new Pakistani state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. Afghanistan argued that the Durand Line was never intended to be an official boundary and called for the Pashtun areas to be handed over to its control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. This stance led to significant tensions, with Afghanistan being the only country to vote against Pakistan's membership in the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>. Afghanistan also began supporting Pashtun separatist movements, leading to diplomatic relations being severed in the early 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. These issues persisted even after Afghanistan became a republic in 1973 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

## Role in the Afghan Taliban

The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 transformed the regional dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>. Following the Soviet withdrawal and subsequent civil war, the Taliban emerged, drawing heavily on ethnic Pashtuns educated in Pakistan's religious schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>. Pakistan's military and intelligence establishment saw an opportunity to gain control over its historically troublesome northern neighbour and began supporting the new group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. The Taliban rapidly grew in strength, seizing Kabul by September 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>.

## Role in the Pakistani Taliban (TTP)

Pakistan's decision to join the "War on Terror" after 9/11 led to significant internal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>. In 2004, Pakistan launched a massive military operation in the Pashtun-dominated border area known as the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>. This incursion, involving about 70,000 troops, caused widespread anger among local leaders and the thousands of Pashtuns who had fought for the Taliban in Afghanistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>.

In 2007, following a controversial military raid, a new group, Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), or the Pakistani Taliban, emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>. This group, drawing on various militant factions, launched an uprising to end Pakistan's efforts to control the Pashtun tribal areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>.

The [[relationship_between_pakistan_and_the_taliban_regime_in_afghanistan | relationship between the TTP and the Afghan Taliban]] is complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>. They share close personal and ethnic ties, as well as a similar broad ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>. TTP fighters also participated in attacks against NATO forces in Afghanistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>. However, their agendas differ: the TTP aims to oust Pakistan from tribal areas, while the Afghan Taliban focused on expelling NATO from Afghanistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>.

## Current Dynamics and Implications

The Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan in August 2021 was viewed as a victory by Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>. However, this also heralded a revival of the TTP, which intensified its [[pakistani_taliban_attacks_and_security_challenges | attacks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:00">[11:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:00">[11:28:00]</a>. Despite Islamabad's hopes, the Afghan Taliban showed little willingness to rein in the TTP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a>. Instead, Kabul organized talks between the two sides, leading to a ceasefire that eventually broke down in November 2022, sparking a new wave of attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44:00">[11:44:00]</a>.

The unresolved border issue and the "divided Pashtun nation" have re-emerged as significant points of contention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>. A dispute over a new fence in early 2022 saw the Afghan information minister explicitly raise the unresolved status of the Durand Line and its division of the Pashtun nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:00]</a>.

This apparent refusal by the Afghan Taliban to crack down on the TTP, coupled with references to the contested border and a divided Pashtun nation, causes concern in Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:58:00">[12:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:04:00">[13:04:00]</a>. Pakistan, having nurtured the Afghan Taliban for its own ends, now faces the possibility that the tide is turning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:16:00">[13:16:00]</a>. If the Afghan Taliban embraces its Pakistani offshoot and builds relations with [[pakistans_geopolitical_relations_with_afghanistan_india_iran_and_china | India]], this would mark a dramatic reversal in [[relationship_between_pakistan_and_the_taliban_regime_in_afghanistan | relations between Pakistan and the Taliban]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:22:00">[13:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:27:00">[13:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:00">[13:32:00]</a>.

> [!INFO] Summary
> The Pashtun communities, historically divided by the British-drawn Durand Line, are a central factor in the [[historical_context_of_pakistan_and_afghanistan_relations | historical context of Pakistan and Afghanistan relations]]. Their ethno-linguistic ties form the backbone of both the Afghan Taliban and the Pakistani Taliban (TTP). Afghanistan's long-standing refusal to recognize the Durand Line and its support for Pashtun self-determination continue to be sources of tension. The current [[relationship_between_pakistan_and_the_taliban_regime_in_afghanistan | relationship between Pakistan and the Taliban regime in Afghanistan]] is further complicated by the Afghan Taliban's apparent reluctance to control the TTP, highlighting the ongoing impact of Pashtun identity on regional stability.

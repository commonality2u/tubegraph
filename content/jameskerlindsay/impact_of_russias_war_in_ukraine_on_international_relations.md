While global attention has been fixed on [[russia_ukraine_conflict | Russia's war in Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, a long-standing territorial dispute in Russia's east has escalated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The renewed focus on the southern Kuril Islands, claimed by both Russia and Japan, highlights how the [[russia_ukraine_conflict | war in Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a> is reshaping international relations and reigniting dormant tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## The Unresolved Legacy of World War II

Almost eight decades after the end of the Second World War, Russia and Japan have yet to reach a formal peace treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This is due to their ongoing disagreement over the southern Kuril Islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. These islands are strategically important and possess significant mineral and energy reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Historical Context of the Kuril Islands Dispute
The Kuril Islands are an archipelago of 56 main volcanic islands and many islets, stretching approximately 1,200 kilometers (750 miles) between Hokkaido, Japan, and Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

*   **Treaty of Shimoda (1855)**: Russia and Japan agreed to share Sakhalin Island and divided control of the Kuril Islands. Russia took the northern islands from Urup, while Japan gained sovereignty over the three main southern islands (Iturup, Kunashir, Shikotan) and the Habomai Islets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Treaty of St Petersburg (1875)**: Russia ceded the entire Kuril Island chain to Japan in return for control of all of Sakhalin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **Russo-Japanese War (1904)**: Japan defeated Russia, leading Moscow to cede the southern half of Sakhalin Island to Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. This defeat contributed to the Russian Revolution and the eventual creation of the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **World War II (1945)**: Following the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan on August 8, 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. The USSR invaded southern Sakhalin Island and, despite Japan's surrender on August 15, moved to take the Kuril Islands. By early September 1945, the entire chain was under Russian control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **1956 Peace Declaration**: Moscow and Tokyo signed a landmark declaration formally ending the state of war and re-establishing diplomatic relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. However, they could not sign a formal peace treaty due to disagreements over the Kuril Islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. The declaration stated that Shikotan and the Habomai Islets would be returned to Japan upon a final peace treaty, but Japan insisted on sovereignty over all four areas originally ceded in 1855, calling them "Northern Territories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

### Post-Cold War Developments
With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Japan called on the Russian Federation to formally return the islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. However, Moscow was reluctant, citing Japan's alliance with the United States (fearing militarization) and the islands' economic value, including extensive fishing waters and potential oil and gas reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

In 2016, there appeared to be progress when President Vladimir Putin and then-Prime Minister Shinzo Abe agreed to promote economic cooperation, seemingly acknowledging the Kuril Islands question remained open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. Further talks in 2018 aimed to base discussions on the 1956 peace declaration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

Hopes were short-lived, as in 2020, Russia introduced a constitutional change explicitly outlawing any moves to relinquish territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Russia also increased its military presence on the islands, installing sophisticated anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. By July 2021, Moscow stated the question was closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

## Escalation Amidst the Ukraine War

The situation intensified after [[russia_ukraine_conflict | Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

*   **Japan's Stance**: On February 28, 2022, Japan's Foreign Ministry stated that Russia was in "occupation of the Northern Territories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. Subsequently, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi openly called the islands an integral part of Japan, a clear departure from previous language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   **Russia's Response**: The Russian government countered that the islands were legally transferred as "punishment for Japan's aggression and its alliance with Nazi Germany" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
*   **United States Support**: Washington affirmed its support for Japan's claims over the islands, a stance it has held since the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   **Economic Measures and Sanctions**: Russia signed an amendment exempting businesses on the islands from corporate, property, and land taxes for up to 20 years, a decision condemned by Tokyo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. Relations were further strained by Japan's decision to join Western sanctions on Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>, leading Moscow to add Japan to its list of "unfriendly countries" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. This has raised speculation about potential reprisals, such as banning Japanese fishing vessels from the waters around the islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. Tokyo has also increased monitoring of Russian military activity in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   **Suspension of Peace Talks**: Russia has officially suspended peace talks with Japan over the Kuril Islands issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

## Prospects for Conflict and Resolution

Despite the rising tensions, direct conflict is considered highly unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

> [!INFO] Unlikelihood of Direct Conflict
> Japan is not expected to invade the islands to reclaim them, even with Russia's military preoccupied elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Russia remains a nuclear power, and Japan, like NATO regarding [[russia_ukraine_conflict | Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>, will avoid actions that Moscow would perceive as a direct attack on its territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

The [[russia_ukraine_conflict | current conflict in Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a> is expected to make the Kuril Islands dispute more difficult to resolve, at least for now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. However, Russia's economic isolation [[russia_ukraine_conflict | over Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a> may eventually necessitate rebuilding ties with Western countries, including Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. This future need for economic reconnection could create an opportunity for negotiations leading to a final settlement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

The future of the Kuril Islands dispute, and whether Japan and Russia can finally sign a peace treaty more than 75 years after World War II, largely depends on the outcomes and internal changes within Russia following the end of the [[russia_ukraine_conflict | war in Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. The [[russia_ukraine_conflict | new war in Europe]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a> might, unexpectedly, provide the impetus to resolve this long-standing issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

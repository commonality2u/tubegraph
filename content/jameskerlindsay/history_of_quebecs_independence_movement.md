On October 30, 1995, Quebec narrowly voted against seceding from Canada, with just over 50,000 votes separating the "Yes" and "No" sides out of nearly 5 million ballots cast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Despite this close call, there is now significantly less discussion about [[quebec_independence_movement | Quebec's independence movement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. While the common perception is that independence movements tend to grow until they succeed or are suppressed, this is not always the case, and Quebec serves as a prime example of a movement that has faded over time despite once commanding significant support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Canada and Quebec: A Distinct Identity

Canada, the second largest UN member state by area after Russia, covers nearly 10 million square kilometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Its population is approximately 38 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. As a federal system, Canada comprises 10 provinces and three territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Quebec is the largest province, at 1.5 million square kilometers, comparable in size to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. It is Canada's second most populous province, with around 8.5 million inhabitants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

What distinguishes Quebec is its language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. While Canada is officially bilingual (English and French), about 80% of Canadians speak English as their first language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. In stark contrast, 80% of Quebec's population speaks French as their primary language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

## Historical Roots of Quebec's Identity

The story of European presence in Quebec began in the early 16th century when French explorers and traders established the first settlements of New France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. By the mid-17th century, France's colonial holdings in North America stretched to the Gulf of Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

### British Rule and Preservation of Culture

Following the Seven Years' War, France ceded its North American territories east of the Mississippi River to Britain under the 1763 Treaty of Paris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. Crucially, the Treaty allowed the Catholic, French inhabitants to continue practicing their religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. This was further affirmed by the Quebec Act of 1774, which also confirmed the continued use of French civil law in the province <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

In 1791, after the US War of Independence, Quebec was divided into two parts: predominantly French-speaking Lower Canada and English-speaking Upper Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Tensions between the communities grew, leading to a rebellion in Lower Canada in 1837 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. In 1841, the two territories merged to form the Province of Canada, a move intended to quell French agitation, with English stipulated as the sole official language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

In 1867, Canada confederated with Nova Scotia and New Brunswick to form the Dominion of Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. As Canada expanded, Quebec's borders also changed, assuming its current form in 1927 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. Throughout this period, Quebec maintained its strong Francophone and Catholic identity, increasingly at odds with the rest of Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

## Rise of the Independence Movement

The "Quiet Revolution" began in 1960 with a new liberal provincial government in Quebec, fostering a greater sense of self-confidence that fueled calls for a looser relationship with Canada or even full independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

In response, the Canadian government under Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau (a Quebec native) pushed back against Quebec nationalism, notably by making French an official language of Canada as a whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. However, the separatist mood continued to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

In 1976, the Parti Québécois came to power on a platform of "sovereignty association," proposing that Quebec become largely independent but share certain governmental functions, such as currency, with Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. These ideas were put to a referendum on May 20, 1980, but were rejected by 59.6% of the electorate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. The Parti Québécois did not hold another referendum and was voted out of power in 1985 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

## The 1995 Referendum and Its Aftermath

Less than a decade later, the Parti Québécois returned to power, again advocating for Quebec's sovereignty and calling for another referendum with shared functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

### The Near Miss of 1995

The second referendum took place on October 30, 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. With a remarkably high turnout of 93.5% (4.75 million votes out of just over 5 million registered voters), the proposals were defeated by an incredibly narrow margin of 50.6% to 49.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. This amounted to a difference of just under 55,000 votes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. This event had a significant [[impact_of_the_1995_referendum_on_quebecs_independence | impact on Quebec's independence sentiment]].

### Legal Rulings and the Clarity Act

The close result of the 1995 referendum prompted important developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

The Canadian Government asked the Supreme Court for a ruling on whether Quebec could unilaterally secede <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. On August 20, 1998, the Court ruled that there was no right to unilateral secession under Canadian or international law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. However, it also noted that if Quebec clearly voted to secede, Canada should not deny that right, and both parties should negotiate in good faith, considering the interests of all provinces and the federal government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

This led to the passing of the Clarity Act by the Canadian Parliament in July 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. This Act set out how secession questions would be handled in the future:
*   Any referendum question must be clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   If independence is voted for, subsequent negotiations must include all Canadian provinces and indigenous peoples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   Any act of secession would require a Canadian constitutional amendment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

In essence, Canada was willing to consider secession if done democratically and consensually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Although Quebec has not officially accepted the Clarity Act, it provides a potential framework for future secession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

## Current State of the Independence Movement

A quarter-century after the last referendum, polling indicates a significant decline in support for independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. Today, support for independence ranges from a quarter to a third of the population, with a clear majority opposed to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. This is reflected in voting patterns; the two largest parties in Quebec, which garnered about three-quarters of the vote in the 2018 provincial elections, oppose independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

### Shifting Focus and Identity

The decline in independence sentiment is attributed to a complex array of reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. One key factor is a shift from outright independence to focusing on political and [[cultural_and_linguistic_identity_in_quebec | cultural autonomy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. While support for independence has dropped, Quebec nationalism remains strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. The largest party in Quebec, though not pro-independence, is nationalist and supports greater provincial autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

Further steps have been taken to preserve Quebec's French language identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. Despite French being the sole official language since the 1970s, concerns about English encroachment led to new laws and the establishment of an office to ensure everyday French use, which seems to have eased fears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. This reflects [[contemporary_political_dynamics_in_quebec | contemporary political dynamics in Quebec]].

### Demographic Shifts

[[demographic_changes_and_their_impact_on_quebecs_independence_sentiment | Demographic changes]] also play a crucial role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Unlike many independence movements where youth support is stronger, in Quebec, those over 55 are more likely to support separation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Younger generations appear more comfortable with a dual Canadian and Francophone identity, with only about a quarter supporting independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. This trend suggests a continued decline in independence support in the coming years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

### The Future of the Movement

Despite the decline, it may be too early to declare the [[quebec_independence_movement | independence movement]] entirely over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. It still commands support from a significant portion of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. Polling indicates that while 40% believe the sovereignty movement has passed its prime, nearly half believe it will return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

Immigration could be a crucial factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. The number of English and non-French speakers is projected to increase, with Statistics Canada suggesting the Francophone population could decline to between 69-72% by 2036 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. The question is whether this will dilute independence support or fuel a renewed sense of Francophone nativism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

## Conclusion

Quebec is a unique case study in secession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. Despite centuries under British rule, it has maintained its strong Francophone heritage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. The quest for political and cultural independence intensified in the 1960s, culminating in the remarkably close 1995 referendum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

However, over the past quarter-century, calls for independence have subsided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. While a significant portion of the population still desires sovereign statehood, and Quebec likely remains the most serious independence movement in the Americas, the numbers are considerably lower than they once were <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

While the ambition for statehood is projected to decline, it's too soon to definitively write off the movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. It may well resurface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. Currently, Quebec is one of the few territories globally with an explicit, democratic route to independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. Yet, having secured this right and taken steps to preserve its distinct cultural identity, it appears less inclined to separate from Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. This makes Quebec a perpetually fascinating study for anyone interested in modern secession and independence movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.

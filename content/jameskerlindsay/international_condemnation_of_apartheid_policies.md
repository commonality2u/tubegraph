During the [[apartheid_and_the_creation_of_bantustans_in_south_africa | apartheid]] era, South Africa established four nominally independent states known as Bantustans or homelands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These were designed to perpetuate [[racial_segregation_policies_during_apartheid | racial segregation]], which underpinned white minority rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The [[international_recognition_and_sovereignty_of_bantustans | International Community never recognised these four so-called states]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Reasons for Condemnation

The international community considered the creation of Bantustans to be a unique case where a country was not permitted to declare parts of its territory independent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The homelands were deliberately designed to reinforce the institutionalised racism of the [[apartheid_and_the_creation_of_bantustans_in_south_africa | apartheid]] system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, attracting considerable international condemnation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

South Africa instituted a formal policy of [[racial_segregation_policies_during_apartheid | racial segregation]], known as [[apartheid_and_the_creation_of_bantustans_in_south_africa | apartheid]], in 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. This policy involved the Population Registration Act of 1950, which required all South Africans to be defined by race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>, and the Group Areas Act, which set up separate residential and business areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. These measures led to millions of Black South Africans being forcibly evicted from their lands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

The Bantustans became a key part of the [[apartheid_and_the_creation_of_bantustans_in_south_africa | apartheid]] system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. International criticism against South Africa's racist policies grew, especially after the Promotion of Bantu Self-Government Act in 1959 laid the groundwork for self-rule in these areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a> and the country became the Republic of South Africa in 1961 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. The Homeland Citizenship Act of 1970 further intensified this by making every Black South African a citizen of one of the homelands, regardless of their residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

## United Nations Response

The Bantu Homelands Constitution Act of March 1971, which empowered the government to grant independence to any homeland, sparked an international outcry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

*   In November 1971, the UN General Assembly passed a resolution condemning the creation of self-governing Bantustans and the forced relocation of people, arguing these policies were designed to weaken the rights of Black Africans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   Another General Assembly resolution called upon all governments and organizations not to deal with any Bantustan institutions or accord them any form of recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
*   Despite these warnings, South Africa declared the Republic of Transkei independent on October 26, 1976 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. This act immediately rendered every Black South African assigned Transkei citizenship a foreigner in South Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
*   The UN General Assembly again condemned the move, urging UN members not to recognise these entities as states or have dealings with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. The Security Council reiterated this position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

South Africa remained undeterred, creating three more "independent" Bantustans: Bophutatswana (1977), Venda (1979), and Ciskei (1981), collectively known as the TBVC States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. Crucially, no UN member ever recognised these entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Even neighboring Lesotho resisted pressure from South Africa to recognise Transkei, a stance praised by the UN Security Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

## Demise of Apartheid and Bantustans

The end of [[apartheid_and_the_creation_of_bantustans_in_south_africa | apartheid]] in the late 1980s brought about the demise of the Bantustans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. The UN General Assembly called on the new South African government to peacefully reincorporate the homelands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. On April 27, 1994, the South African Parliament repealed the legislation that created the Bantustans, including the four nominally independent ones and the six others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. South Africa became a united state under a new constitutional order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

The [[international_recognition_and_sovereignty_of_bantustans | international community]] rejected the Bantustans' independence not based on their capacity to be states, but because it was viewed as a cynical move to support a racist system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. Their existence emanated from a desire to support the racist policy of [[apartheid_and_the_creation_of_bantustans_in_south_africa | Apartheid]], which was judged to be a crime against humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. The four independent Bantustans represent the only example of a country granting independence to part of its territory that was rejected by the wider international community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

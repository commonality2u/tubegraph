Cyprus, as the European Union's most easterly member, has gained international attention for its leading efforts in providing aid to Gaza throughout 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The island has emerged as the European Union's outpost in the Middle East, becoming a vital element in broader humanitarian operations in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Historical Context of Humanitarian Hub

The value of Cyprus as a hub for EU humanitarian and crisis management in the Middle East was firmly established in 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. This occurred during the war in southern Lebanon between Israel and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia, when Cyprus became the center of a major international evacuation effort for tens of thousands of foreigners fleeing the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

## The Cyprus Maritime Corridor for Gaza Aid

With the ongoing war in Gaza, Cyprus's role as a humanitarian hub has once again come to the forefront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. The Cypriot government, in collaboration with the EU, the United States, and various other partners, established the Cyprus Maritime Corridor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. This initiative has delivered crucial assistance to nearly 2 million people affected by the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. As tensions between Israel and Hezbollah intensify on the Lebanese border, Cyprus is again preparing to manage potential humanitarian efforts for the region's next conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

## Challenges and Geopolitical Complexities

Despite its long-standing close ties to the Arab world and its significant role in humanitarian relief, Cyprus has recently faced [[threats_to_cyprus_from_hezbollah | threats of attack]] from the Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. These [[threats_to_cyprus_from_hezbollah | threats]] are linked to Cyprus's deepening military cooperation with Israel, which included major joint exercises in May 2023, widely seen as simulating a war against Hezbollah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, warned that if Cyprus allowed Israel to use its airports or bases for attacks on Lebanon, it would be considered part of the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

This situation raises questions about whether Cyprus's close ties to Israel are jeopardizing its humanitarian role in the wider Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

### Response and Diplomatic Stance

The Cypriot government asserts that there is no contradiction between its strong [[cyprus_relations_with_israel_and_the_middle_east | relations with Israel]] and its humanitarian functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. They argue that robust ties with the Israeli government can actually facilitate its role as a humanitarian hub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. Cyprus also maintains very close connections with many Arab countries, including Egypt and Gulf Arab states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.

President Nikos Christodoulides affirmed that Cyprus is not involved in any military conflict planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. The EU has condemned [[threats_to_cyprus_from_hezbollah | threats against Cyprus]], stressing solidarity and indicating that an attack on Cyprus would be considered an attack on the entire Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

Cyprus is still perceived by many across the region as a safe and neutral territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

## Conclusion

Cyprus has become a valuable component of the EU's efforts to provide humanitarian assistance in the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. However, its close bilateral [[cyprus_relations_with_israel_and_the_middle_east | relationship with Israel]] now appears to expose the country to risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. This situation underscores the degree to which Cyprus's geopolitical position has made the EU a frontline actor in the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.

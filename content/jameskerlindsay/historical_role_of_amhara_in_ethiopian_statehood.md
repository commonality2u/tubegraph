The Amhara people have traditionally held a central and defining role in the Ethiopian state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. However, over recent decades, tensions have escalated between the Amhara and the central government, as well as with other dominant ethnic groups in Ethiopia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Amhara Region: Geography and Demographics

The Amhara region is located in the northwest of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. It spans approximately 155,000 square kilometers (60,000 square miles), making it the country's third-largest regional state after Oromia and the Somali region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. It shares an international border with Sudan to its west and is bordered by several other Ethiopian provinces, including Afar to its east, Oromia to its south, Benishangul-Gumuz to its southwest, and Tigray to its north <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

Amhara is home to roughly 30 million people, making it Ethiopia's second most populous region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Most inhabitants are ethnic Amhara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, who are the second-largest ethnic group in Ethiopia, surpassed only by the Oromo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. The Amhara speak a Semitic language and are predominantly Oriental Orthodox Christian, adhering to one of the world's oldest established Christian churches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Historical Dominance in the Ethiopian Empire

Ethiopia, one of the world's most ancient countries, emerged as the Kingdom of Axum nearly 2,000 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. The Ethiopian Empire, also known as Abyssinia, was established in the late 13th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. From its inception, the Amhara largely dominated the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. They held many crucial positions of power within the Ethiopian hierarchy, including that of the emperor, extending their influence across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. The Amharic language and Orthodox Christianity became central to the Ethiopian national identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

## Decline and the Rise of Amhara Nationalism

The traditional Amhara dominance in Ethiopian affairs began to wane after 1974, when the last Ethiopian Emperor, Haile Selassie, was overthrown by a left-wing military coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Although many officers of the new communist regime, known as the Derg, were Amhara, the regime reduced their traditional influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

This decline was further cemented in 1991 when the Derg was overthrown by a coalition of ethnic militias led by the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. In an effort to address longstanding grievances of the country's minorities, the new TPLF government reorganized Ethiopia as a federation along ethnic lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. In 1995, Ethiopia was divided into nine regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Crucially, several areas traditionally controlled by the Amhara were incorporated into the Tigray region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

This [[ethnic_tensions_and_federalism_in_ethiopia | Tigrayan dominance]] in the new federal system and the land transfer fueled Amhara resentment towards the central government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Many Amhara began to abandon their traditional support for an Ethiopian national identity, arguing that their historic place had been undermined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. Instead, they turned to Amhara nationalism, advocating for better representation of their interests within Ethiopia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. This resentment persisted for two decades as the Tigrayans, the fourth-largest group, continued to dominate the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

## Involvement in the Tigray War and Subsequent Discontent

In 2018, Abiy Ahmed Ali, an ethnic Oromo, became the new Ethiopian Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. Initially, this was seen as a positive development for the Amhara, as Abiy Ahmed, perceived as a reformer, worked to reduce the TPLF's power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

However, tensions escalated in 2020 when a dispute over national elections led to the Tigray War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Amhara forces joined the federal government's fight against the TPLF, seeing an opportunity to reclaim territories lost in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. They seized control of the western part of the Tigray region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

Despite the federal government defeating the TPLF in November 2022, the subsequent peace agreement called for the withdrawal of non-Tigrayan forces, including Amhara militias, from western Tigray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. This perceived betrayal by the federal government led to even greater discontent among the Amhara, who felt their contributions were ignored and historical grievances unaddressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. As a result, tensions between Amhara forces and the central government began to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

## Current Conflict and Future Implications

Alongside deteriorating relations with the federal government, problems deepened between the Amhara and neighboring Oromo due to [[impact_of_oromoamhara_relations_on_ethiopian_politics | political suspicions]] and growing confrontations along their boundary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. This backdrop of growing Amhara-Oromo fighting led the Ethiopian government to launch a military operation on April 9, 2023, to disarm local militias in Amhara and bring them under national military control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

This move was met with widespread protests and resistance, spearheaded by a nationalist movement called Fano <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. Fano, a loose affiliation of organizations with considerable popular support among the Amhara, quickly recruited new fighters from the Amhara security forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. By mid-2023, Fano had captured major towns, leading the government to declare a state of emergency on August 4, 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

Despite the Ethiopian National Defense Forces regaining control of many towns, opposition to the government continues, with increasing use of brutal tactics, including artillery bombardment and airstrikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Efforts to find a political solution have failed, partly due to the lack of a defined Fano leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. The ongoing violence and rising lawlessness contribute to a sense that the situation in Amhara is spiraling out of control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

The conflict in Amhara poses a significant threat to Ethiopia's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. As the second-largest ethnic group, a full-scale conflict involving the Amhara would have devastating consequences, not just in human terms but also politically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. The question remains whether Ethiopia can survive if the ethnic group that has historically symbolized Ethiopian identity becomes marginalized and excluded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. The complex [[ethnic_tensions_and_federalism_in_ethiopia | ethnic tensions]] extend beyond Amhara, requiring a precarious balancing act to maintain national unity while addressing competing grievances of various ethnic groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. While Ethiopia has shown resilience to past conflicts, the fundamental role of the Amhara in the country's development means that the current conflict could potentially lead to its disintegration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. Dealing with the conflict in Amhara is thus more critical than many outsiders might appreciate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

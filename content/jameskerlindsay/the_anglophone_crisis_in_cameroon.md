The [[cameroons_anglophone_crisis | Anglophone Crisis in Cameroon]] is considered one of the most serious conflicts in Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It has resulted in thousands of lives lost, hundreds of thousands displaced, and directly affected millions more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Origins of the Conflict

A recurring theme in international relations is how borders drawn during [[colonial_legacy_and_its_impact_on_cameroons_conflict | colonial times]] and decisions made at decolonization have lasting effects, particularly in Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. The [[cameroons_anglophone_crisis | Anglophone Crisis]] in Cameroon, also known as the Anglophone Problem, is a significant example of a conflict stemming from the [[colonial_legacy_and_its_impact_on_cameroons_conflict | legacy of colonialism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Since 2017, fighting has escalated between English-speaking pro-independence armed groups in the west and the French-speaking central government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

Cameroon is located in West Africa, covering 475,000 square kilometers (180,000 square miles), making it the 53rd largest UN member state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Its population is estimated at around 26 million, composed of various ethnic groups and approximately 24 languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. The two official languages, French and English, form the main linguistic [[cameroons_anglophone_and_francophone_divide | divide]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. While the majority speak French, around 20 percent of the population are primarily English speakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

The historical roots trace back to the 19th-century scramble for Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Germany established its most significant imperial holding in the territory of Kamerun, which included modern-day Cameroon and parts of the Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Gabon, and Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. German control was formalized at the Berlin Conference in 1884 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

However, during the First World War, Britain and France seized and divided Kamerun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. France took approximately 80 percent, while Britain controlled the remaining 20 percent, bordering British Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. In 1922, the League of Nations confirmed Britain's control over the British Cameroons, which were administered from Nigeria and divided into Northern and Southern Cameroons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

As decolonization began post-World War II, both British and French Cameroons became UN Trust Territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. On January 1, 1960, the French Cameroons gained independence as the Republic of Cameroon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. The British Cameroons were then given two options: join independent Nigeria or unite with the Republic of Cameroon; full independence was not an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

Referendums were held on February 11, 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. The predominantly Muslim Northern Cameroons voted by 60 percent to join Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. The Southern Cameroons, however, voted by 70 percent to join the Republic of Cameroon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. The UN endorsed this result on April 21, 1961 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Though the process is now contested by Anglophone Cameroonians who argue results were not formally confirmed, it was decided the two parts would unite as a federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. On October 1, 1961, the Southern Cameroons officially joined, forming the Federal Republic of Cameroon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

## Deterioration of the Relationship

The relationship between the English and French-speaking parts of Cameroon soon soured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Despite some Anglophones holding senior positions, like John Foncha (premier of the Southern Cameroons turned prime minister and vice president), the Anglophone minority felt overpowered by the French-speaking majority, which had established a highly centralized federation under autocratic first president Ahmadou Ahidjo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

On May 20, 1972, a decade later, a referendum abolished the federation, granting more powers to the president and renaming the country the United Republic of Cameroon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. The Anglophone region, divided into the North West and South West provinces, saw its powers decline further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. Paul Biya, who replaced Ahidjo in 1982, continued to erode the region's autonomy and changed the country's name back to the Republic of Cameroon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

## Rise of the Anglophone Movement

Against this backdrop, English-speaking groups convened the first All Anglophone Conference in 1993, calling for the restoration of the 1961 federal constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Anglophones, including former prime minister Foncha, began campaigning internationally for autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. In 1994, the Conference reiterated its demands, threatening a declaration of independence if they were not met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

Rather than address concerns, the [[government_and_separatist_dynamics_in_cameroon | government]] further centralized the constitution and launched a crackdown on what it termed separatism, leading to arrests and sporadic violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. By around 2000, political unrest appeared largely quelled, though pro-independence political activity persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

## Current Phase of the Crisis (Post-2016)

The current phase of the [[cameroons_anglophone_crisis | Anglophone Crisis]] began in late 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Protests erupted over increasing numbers of French speakers being posted to Anglophone schools and courts, leading to another government crackdown that quickly escalated into violence as armed groups retaliated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

On October 1, 2017, the anniversary of the Southern Cameroons' incorporation into Cameroon, several groups announced the creation of an independent Federal Republic of [[rise_of_ambazonia_and_the_quest_for_independence | Ambazonia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. Despite many pro-independence organizations favoring a peaceful process, the Cameroon [[government_and_separatist_dynamics_in_cameroon | government]] launched a major armed campaign against dissent in November 2017, leading to increased militancy among groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

By mid-2019, the situation became increasingly unstable, with civilians targeted in addition to clashes between [[government_and_separatist_dynamics_in_cameroon | government forces]] and separatists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. The [[humanitarian_impact_of_the_crisis_in_cameroon | death toll]] rose to several thousands, and over half a million people were displaced, with tens of thousands fleeing to Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. Anglophone militias also targeted schools, which they viewed as a means for the [[government_and_separatist_dynamics_in_cameroon | government]] to impose French; estimates suggested 80 percent of schools in Anglophone regions were closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

In 2019, as fighting threatened to spill into Francophone areas and risk civil war, President Biya announced a 'Major National Dialogue' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. Though widely dismissed by many Anglophone groups as propaganda, the dialogue proposed measures including:
*   Special status for the two Anglophone regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>
*   Election of local governors and reintegration of fighters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>
*   Restoration of the country's former name, the United Republic of Cameroon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>
*   Re-launch of major infrastructure projects in English-speaking regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>

These proposals, while offering some autonomy, fell short of federalism or full independence demanded by many Anglophones, and were deemed insufficient by international observers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

In 2020, as the situation worsened, reports (later denied by the [[government_and_separatist_dynamics_in_cameroon | government]]) emerged of secret ceasefire talks in July with prominent jailed pro-independence figures, including Julius AyukTabe, proclaimed first president of [[rise_of_ambazonia_and_the_quest_for_independence | Ambazonia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

Despite growing international and internal calls for dialogue and [[efforts_for_a_peaceful_settlement_in_cameroons_anglophone_regions | a peaceful settlement]], fighting has continued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. On October 24, 2020, armed fighters attacked a school, killing children, an act condemned by the UN Secretary-General <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. There are growing claims of serious and systematic human rights abuses by both sides, including kidnapping and child soldiers by pro-independence militias, and extrajudicial killings, torture, and cruel punishment by [[government_and_separatist_dynamics_in_cameroon | government forces]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. The [[humanitarian_impact_of_the_crisis_in_cameroon | death toll]] and number of displaced continue to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

## Conclusion

The [[cameroons_anglophone_crisis | Anglophone Crisis in Cameroon]] is a tragic example of how peoples with different historical experiences and cultural traditions, merged into a single state during [[colonial_history_of_cameroon | colonization]] and decolonization, can break down when one group asserts authority and abandons the independence-era political system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

A federal settlement granting extensive autonomy to the Anglophone community was an obvious and seemingly acceptable solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. However, positions have become polarized, with Anglophones deeply mistrusting the central [[government_and_separatist_dynamics_in_cameroon | government]] and determined to achieve an independent [[rise_of_ambazonia_and_the_quest_for_independence | Ambazonia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. Meanwhile, the central [[government_and_separatist_dynamics_in_cameroon | government]] remains determined to retain the territory, despite decades of repression and efforts to suppress Anglophone political and cultural autonomy, which have led many English-speaking Cameroonians to no longer wish to be part of the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

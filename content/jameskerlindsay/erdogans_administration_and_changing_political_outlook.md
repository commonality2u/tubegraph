In October 2021, [[recep_tayyip_erdogans_political_strategy_and_future | Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan]] initiated a brief diplomatic crisis by declaring that ambassadors from ten Western nations, including the United States, France, and Germany, would no longer be welcome in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While a quick resolution was found, this incident underscored a deeper issue that could signal the end of Turkey's century-long alignment with Europe and the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The relationship between Turkey and its key Western partners has become increasingly strained, raising questions about its continued status as part of the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

## Historical Western Orientation

For the past century, Turkey has pursued a European and Western orientation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. Following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire after World War I, the new Republic of Turkey, founded by Mustafa Kemal (Ataturk), embarked on a path of modernization and Europeanization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. This included pushing Islam out of the public sphere and adopting the Latin alphabet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

Turkey joined key Western organizations:
*   North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1950 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>
*   Council of Europe in 1950 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>
*   Signed an association agreement with the European Economic Community (EEC), precursor to the European Union, in 1963, opening the door for potential future membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>

Despite these ties, Turkey's path towards European integration was slow, hampered by military coups that raised questions about its commitment to democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a> and tensions with Greece over Cyprus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. There was also a perception that predominantly Muslim Turkey was being excluded from what was seen as a "Christian club," an impression that intensified with the EU's expansion to former communist countries in Central and Eastern Europe after the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. By the late 1990s, relations were strained, but in 1999, Turkey finally became a candidate for EU membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.

## Erdogan's Rise and Initial Pro-European Stance

Ironically, it was the election of an overtly religious administration in November 2002 that seemed to inject new momentum into Turkey's EU accession process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. The Justice and Development Party (AKP), led by [[erdogans_rise_to_power_and_political_career | Recep Tayyip Erdogan]], a former Istanbul mayor who had been imprisoned for Islamist sedition, appeared to herald a new direction for Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>.

Initially, [[erdogans_impact_on_turkish_domestic_and_foreign_policy | Erdogan]] viewed EU membership as a means to expand religious freedoms and challenge the powerful military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. He revitalized efforts to resolve the Cyprus issue and introduced political reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>, which led to Turkey formally opening EU membership discussions in 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.

## Shifting Political Outlook and Autocratic Tendencies

However, after 2005, [[erdogans_political_strategies_and_authoritarianism | Erdogan's]] political outlook began to change from that of a pro-European reformist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>. This shift was marked by:
*   Growing autocratic tendencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>
*   Rollback of human rights reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>
*   Curtailment of media freedoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>

This came to a head in May 2013, when massive protests across Turkey were met with a harsh crackdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. Three years later, an attempted military coup against the [[erdogans_policies_and_influence | Erdogan]] administration in 2016 led to a major purge of suspected opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>. Tens of thousands were arrested, and hundreds of thousands lost their jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.

One prominent case was that of Osman Kavala, a Turkish businessman and philanthropist arrested in this purge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>. Charged with attempting to overthrow the government, Kavala's prolonged pre-trial detention led him to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), which unanimously ruled in December 2019 that he had been deprived of his right to liberty and timely justice, ordering his immediate release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>. Despite its obligation as a Council of Europe member to adhere to ECHR rulings, Turkey refused to release him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. As a result, in September 2021, the Council of Europe initiated infringement proceedings against Turkey, potentially leading to suspension or expulsion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.

## The Diplomatic Crisis and its Implications

This refusal prompted ambassadors from ten countries, including the United States and France, to sign a joint letter urging the Turkish government to comply with the ECHR ruling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>. The letter highlighted that Turkey's failure to do so undermined democracy and the rule of law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>. Furious at this move, [[recep_tayyip_erdogans_political_strategy_and_future | Erdogan]] announced that the ambassadors were no longer welcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.

The crisis was quickly defused when the involved countries stated their adherence to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which prohibits diplomats from interfering in the internal affairs of host states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>. This statement, while ambiguous, allowed the Turkish government to back down, declaring its satisfaction that the countries had "learned their lesson" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>.

However, the underlying issues remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>. [[challenges_and_controversies_during_erdogans_governance | Erdogan's]] announcement further underscored the widening rift between Turkey and its Western partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>. Beyond domestic trajectory concerns, Ankara's foreign policy has shifted, notably by forging a close relationship with Putin's Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>. Furthermore, [[erdogans_impact_on_turkish_domestic_and_foreign_policy | Erdogan]] has increasingly blamed Turkey's problems on the West, presenting Europe and the United States as opponents rather than allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>.

The dispute also highlighted Turkey's disregard for the fundamental rules of the Western club, particularly adherence to ECHR rulings, which is a prerequisite for membership in both the Council of Europe and the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. This disregard suggests the potential for Turkey's final estrangement from the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>.

## Debates on Turkey's Future in the West

The decision on a final political separation largely rests with the European Union and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>.

### Arguments for a Break
Some argue that the time has come to make a definitive break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>. Proponents of this view contend that Turkey can no longer be considered an ally or a country sharing fundamental values with its Western partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>. They advocate for ending EU membership talks, suspending or expelling Turkey from the Council of Europe if it fails to comply with obligations, and even removing it from NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>.

### Arguments for Maintaining Ties (Pragmatists)
Conversely, pragmatists argue against a complete rupture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>. They acknowledge that EU accession talks have stalled and Turkey is not a realistic membership candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>, but believe that cutting ties completely would worsen the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:00">[10:34:00]</a>. They fear Turkey would cement partnerships with other "troublesome forces" like Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:00">[10:38:00]</a> and that such a move could have negative consequences in the Muslim world, where it might be perceived as proof of Western opposition to Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>. They advocate for keeping Turkey within the "club," even nominally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:00">[10:59:00]</a>.

### Arguments for Maintaining Ties (Optimists)
Optimists, while despairing of Turkey under [[erdogans_political_strategies_and_authoritarianism | Erdogan]], hope for a future return to the European track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:00">[11:04:00]</a>. They believe it is better to keep this possibility alive and encourage pro-Western forces in Turkey, rather than forcing a break that might reduce choices to religious or secular nationalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>. However, even within this group, many question if Turkey has passed the point of no return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

The prevailing view among observers is that, despite the significant challenges [[the_transformation_of_turkey_under_erdogans_leadership | Turkey]] presents, it is better to keep it notionally part of the West than to force a final split <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:00">[11:33:00]</a>. However, this argument becomes increasingly difficult to sustain with each new crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:45:00">[11:45:00]</a>. If the Turkish government continues to ignore the ECHR, action may be necessary to protect the integrity of human rights in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>. The Osman Kavala case, in particular, may force a fundamental decision regarding Turkey's place in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a>.

[[erdogans_impact_on_turkish_domestic_and_foreign_policy | Turkey]] has always had a complex relationship with the West, despite its secular, European-oriented founding and membership in key Western organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:00">[12:18:00]</a>. However, the past decade under [[erdogans_policies_and_influence | Erdogan's]] administration has challenged this relationship in unprecedented ways, marked by domestic challenges to democratic values and human rights, and an increasingly nationalistic foreign policy, including close ties with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a>. The question remains whether the Turkish Republic is on the verge of finally breaking that relationship, and if Western powers will allow it to happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>.

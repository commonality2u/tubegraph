The [[quebec_independence_movement | Quebec independence movement]] historically represented one of the most significant secessionist movements globally, nearly achieving separation from Canada in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Despite coming "incredibly close" to independence in the 1995 referendum, Quebec has largely faded from news regarding secession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## The 1995 Referendum and its Aftermath
On October 30, 1995, Quebec held a referendum on independence, which was narrowly defeated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. Out of almost 5 million votes cast, just over 50,000 separated the sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The final result was 50.6% against the proposal and 49.4% in favour, a margin of just under 55,000 votes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. The turnout was remarkably high at 93.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

The [[impact_of_the_1995_referendum_on_quebecs_independence_sentiment | impact of the 1995 referendum on Quebec's independence sentiment]] led to significant developments in the relationship between Quebec and the Canadian federal government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

### Supreme Court Ruling
In response to the close vote, the Canadian Government requested a ruling from the country's Supreme Court on whether Quebec could unilaterally secede <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. On August 20, 1998, the Court ruled that there is no right to unilateral secession under Canadian or international law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. However, it also noted that if Quebec clearly voted to secede, Canada should not deny them that right, and both parties should negotiate in good faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

### The Clarity Act
Following the Supreme Court's ruling, the Canadian Parliament passed the Clarity Act in July 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. This act established a framework for future secession questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>:
*   Any referendum question must be clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   If there is a vote for independence, subsequent negotiations must involve all Canadian provinces and Indigenous peoples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   Secession would require an amendment to the Canadian constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

Although Quebec has officially refused to accept the Clarity Act, it provides a potential framework for its future secession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

## Current State of the [[quebec_independence_movement | Quebec Independence Movement]]
A quarter-century after the 1995 referendum, support for independence in Quebec has significantly declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. Current polling indicates support from only a quarter to a third of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. A clear majority would now vote against independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. This trend is also reflected in provincial voting figures, where the two largest parties, which polled approximately three-quarters of the electorate in 2018, oppose independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

Despite the decline in support for outright independence, Quebec nationalism remains strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. The largest political party in Quebec, while opposing independence, supports greater autonomy for the province <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

## Factors Influencing Contemporary Dynamics

### Shift Towards Political and Cultural Autonomy
A key reason for the decreased focus on outright independence is a shift towards prioritizing political and [[cultural_and_linguistic_identity_in_quebec | cultural autonomy]] within Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. This means maintaining a strong sense of Quebec identity and self-governance without full separation.

### Preservation of [[cultural_and_linguistic_identity_in_quebec | Cultural and Linguistic Identity]]
Quebec has taken further steps to preserve its French language identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. While French has been the sole official language since the 1970s, concerns persisted about the encroachment of English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. New laws to tighten enforcement and the establishment of an office to ensure the everyday use of French in civil administration have helped ease these fears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

### [[demographic_changes_and_their_impact_on_quebecs_independence_sentiment | Demographic Shifts]]
[[demographic_changes_and_their_impact_on_quebecs_independence_sentiment | Demographic changes]] are playing a crucial role in the decline of separatist support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Unlike many other regions where pro-independence sentiment is stronger among the youth, in Quebec, support for separation tends to be among those over 55 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Younger generations appear more at ease with having both a Canadian and Francophone identity, with only about a quarter supporting independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. This suggests that support for independence is likely to continue declining in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

## Future Outlook for Independence
Despite the current decline, it is perhaps "too early to say that the independence movement is at an end in Quebec" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. While less pronounced than before, it still commands significant support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. Polling indicates that almost half of Quebecers believe the sovereignty movement will "one day return," even if 40% think it has had its day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

Immigration may be a crucial factor in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. The number of English and non-French speakers is expected to increase, with Statistics Canada projecting the Francophone population to decline to 69-72% by 2036 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. The question remains whether this will further dilute support for independence or "feed a renewed sense of Francophone nativism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

## Quebec's Unique Position as a Case Study
Quebec remains a fascinating case study for secession and independence movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. Despite coming under British rule in the 18th century, it has maintained a strong Francophone heritage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. While the quest for political and cultural independence intensified from the 1960s, leading to the near-successful 1995 referendum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>, calls for independence have subsided in the past quarter-century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.

Quebec is currently in the unique position of having an explicit route to independence through the [[canadian_federal_political_system | Canadian federal political system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. However, having secured this right and taken steps to preserve its distinct [[cultural_and_linguistic_identity_in_quebec | cultural identity]], it now appears less inclined to separate from Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.

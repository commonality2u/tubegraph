In June 2021, Bulgaria once again blocked the initiation of [[bulgaria_and_north_macedonia_eu_accession_dispute | European Union accession]] talks with neighbouring North Macedonia, escalating a long-standing dispute centered on history and language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This issue, often seen as petty, highlights the significant role identity plays in [[international_relations_and_national_identity_in_the_balkans | international relations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Defining Nationhood
Unlike a state, which confers citizenship, the concept of nationhood is more fluid, linking people through shared language, history, and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Sometimes, a single nation may span two states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, or peoples who once shared bonds may come to view themselves as distinct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. The disagreement between Bulgaria and North Macedonia is a contemporary example where one group views another as part of a single nation, while the other asserts a separate identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This dispute is currently derailing North Macedonia's path toward EU membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Geographical and Demographic Context
Both Bulgaria and North Macedonia are located in Southeast Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   **Bulgaria**: Covers 110,000 square kilometres (around 40,000 square miles), making it the 103rd largest UN member out of 193 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Its population is approximately 7 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   **North Macedonia**: To Bulgaria's immediate west, it spans 26,000 square kilometres (10,000 square miles), making it the 145th largest UN member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Its population is estimated at 2.1 million, based on a 2002 census <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

Both nations are predominantly Slavic-speaking Christian Orthodox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, but also have significant non-Slavic Muslim minorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. In Bulgaria, ethnic Turks constitute about 9% of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, while in North Macedonia, ethnic [[national_identity_and_aspirations_of_albanians | Albanians]] are thought to comprise around 35% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. The core of the current dispute lies in their increasingly divergent interpretations of the past and ethnolinguistic origins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## Historical Origins of the Dispute
The story largely begins with the decline of the Ottoman Empire in the late 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   **1878 Treaty of Berlin**: Established the Principality of Bulgaria as an autonomous state within the Ottoman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Bulgarian Territorial Claims**: The nascent Bulgarian state claimed several neighbouring areas still under Ottoman rule, including Thrace and Macedonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   **Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (VMRO)**: Emerged in the 1890s, dedicated to the liberation of the Macedonian region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. However, Macedonia was also claimed by neighbouring Greece and Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Balkan Wars and World War I**:
    *   In 1912, Bulgaria allied with Greece, Serbia, and Montenegro to expel the Ottomans from Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Bulgaria gained Thrace but only a small part of Macedonia, with the majority taken by Greek and Serb forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
    *   During World War I, Bulgaria sided with Germany and captured the Serbian-held part of Macedonia, but this control was short-lived, with Serbia retaking the region in September 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   **Interwar Period and World War II**: The area became part of the newly established Kingdom of Yugoslavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Despite this, Bulgaria maintained claims, again occupying most of Serbian Macedonia and parts of Greek Macedonia during World War II by siding with Nazi Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. This control also proved temporary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

## Yugoslavia's Influence on Macedonian Identity
The Second World War marked a crucial turning point, as the northern part of Macedonia gained autonomy rather than being reintegrated into Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. It became the Socialist Republic of Macedonia, one of the six constituent republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   **Fostering a Distinct Identity**: In the subsequent years, a deliberate effort was made to foster a distinct Macedonian identity, emphasizing a separate history, language, and culture from neighbouring Bulgaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   **Language Recognition**: In the 1970s, Macedonian, though mutually intelligible with Bulgarian, was officially registered as a separate language by the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

## Independence and the Dispute with Greece
This sense of nationhood became prominent with the disintegration of [[impact_of_yugoslavia_on_macedonian_identity | Yugoslavia]] in the early 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   **Declaration of Independence**: On September 8, 1991, Socialist Macedonia voted to become a separate sovereign state, the Republic of Macedonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
*   **[[historical_background_of_north_macedonia_and_greece_name_dispute | Name Dispute with Greece]]**: This immediately triggered a dispute with Greece, which accused the new country of harbouring territorial claims against its own region of Macedonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Athens blocked its membership in several organizations, including the European Union, until a new name was agreed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   **[[North Macedonia and Greece peace agreement | Prespa Agreement]] (2018)**: After nearly 30 years of UN mediation, Athens and Skopje reached an agreement in June 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. The Republic of Macedonia (or FYROM, as it was known at the UN) officially became the Republic of North Macedonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. This agreement was widely seen as paving the way for the country to open [[impact_of_north_macedonias_political_changes_on_eu_integration | European Union accession talks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

## The Bulgarian-North Macedonian Identity Dispute
The jubilation was short-lived, as another identity dispute, this time with Bulgaria, emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   **Core of the Dispute**: Unlike Greece, Bulgaria did not dispute the country's name or the existence of a Macedonian state; in fact, Bulgaria was the first country to recognize the Republic of Macedonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. Instead, Bulgaria disputed the existence of a separate Macedonian nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   **Bulgarian Perspective**: Bulgaria views the Slavic population of Macedonia as part of the broader Bulgarian nation and considers the Macedonian language a dialect of Bulgarian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   **Macedonian Constitution Clause**: Relations were further strained by a clause in the Macedonian Constitution allowing the country to protect the interests of Macedonians living in neighbouring states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Bulgaria interpreted this as a potential pretext for interference in its domestic affairs or even a territorial claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

## Attempts at Resolution and Renewed Tensions
*   **1999 Joint Declaration**: The two countries signed an 11-point joint declaration in 1999, which appeared to settle the matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Macedonia formally renounced any claim to Bulgaria's territory and clarified its constitution could not be interpreted as a basis for interfering in Bulgaria's internal affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Bulgaria seemingly settled the language issue by explicitly acknowledging the declaration was concluded in "Bulgarian and Macedonian" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   **Resurgence of Nationalism**: Despite the agreement, tensions continued. A nationalist government in Macedonia intensified tensions with both Bulgaria and Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. The Museum of the Macedonian Struggle, for example, presented Bulgaria in a negative light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   **Disputes over Historical Figures**: The countries engaged in an acrimonious dispute over the national identity of key VMRO members, such as Gotse Delchev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
*   **Bulgaria's EU Leverage**: Bulgaria, which joined the European Union in 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>, began threatening to block Macedonia's EU accession talks unless these points of difference were resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

## Recent Political Developments
*   **2017 Friendship Treaty**: In 2017, a more moderate government in Macedonia eased tensions, signing a friendship treaty on August 1, 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. This treaty recognized each other's territorial integrity and established a joint commission to address historical differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   **Lack of Progress and Bulgarian Demands**: However, little progress was made. In October 2019, the Bulgarian government issued over 20 demands that had to be met before it would permit EU accession talks with North Macedonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. It also advised the EU to stop referring to the "Macedonian language," suggesting "the official language of the Republic of North Macedonia" instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   **2020 Veto**: A year later, Sofia vetoed the start of membership negotiations with North Macedonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. This move, widely seen as driven by narrow nationalist reasons, was heavily criticized by Bulgaria's European partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
*   **North Macedonia's Stance**: Skopje reacted with anger, with Deputy Prime Minister Nikola Dimitrov stating, "Who we are is our business. It's a question for the Macedonian people. We think that this should by no means be a precondition for our European future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
*   **Continued Stalemate**: In the following six months, despite a change in the Bulgarian government and last-minute negotiations, no breakthrough was achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. On June 22, 2021, Bulgaria again blocked the opening of formal EU accession talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.
*   **International Criticism**: Bulgaria has lost public relations battle and EU patience has run out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. A European diplomat described Bulgaria's stance as "incomprehensible, indefensible and destabilises the Western Balkans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

## The Enduring Identity Question
The dispute raises complex questions about [[international_relations_and_national_identity_in_the_balkans | national identity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.
*   **Bulgaria's View**: Bulgaria accepts the existence of a sovereign state of North Macedonia, despite historical claims and efforts to seize its territory in the early 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. However, it cannot accept the notion of a distinct Macedonian national identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. Sofia believes that Macedonian identity emerged as a deliberate Yugoslav policy to demonize Bulgaria, and that Slavic Macedonians are "really and truly Bulgarians" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.
*   **North Macedonia's View**: Macedonians assert their own separate national identity that demands acknowledgment and respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.
*   **Irony**: Paradoxically, Bulgaria's current actions are seen as doing more than anything to cement that very Macedonian identity it denies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

In January 2020, [[Britains exit from the European Union | Britain]] formally left the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. While initially hailed as an opportunity for an independent global role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, there has been little evidence of the promised benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Instead, mounting evidence points to severe economic damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, with polls indicating [[public_opinion_on_rejoining_the_eu | public opinion]] is increasingly open to rejoining the EU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The decision to leave remains a central issue in British politics seven years after the vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, with growing calls for reconsideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Background to Britain's Exit
Britain's relationship with European integration has historically been ambivalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. While it recognised the advantages of cooperation, it kept the European Economic Community (EEC) at arm's length, focusing on rebuilding ties with the Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. The UK eventually joined the EEC on January 1, 1973, alongside Ireland and Denmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

From the outset, Britain's commitment was primarily economic, not political <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Tensions grew in the 1980s, despite Britain leading the formation of the Single Market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Conservative governments under Margaret Thatcher became increasingly opposed to greater political integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Subsequent governments also held back from major European projects like the euro and Schengen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

In 2014, following a strong performance by the UK Independence Party (UKIP) in European parliamentary elections, Prime Minister David Cameron pledged a referendum on EU membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. After negotiations to amend membership terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>, a highly divisive debate ensued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. The Leave campaign focused on sovereignty and limiting immigration, arguing that Brexit would restore independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. On June 23, 2016, the UK voted to leave by 52% to 48% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

The subsequent "hard Brexit" pursued by the government involved cutting ties to all EU institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Negotiations to trigger Article 50 (the leaving clause) took several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a> and created severe problems in Northern Ireland, where EU membership underpinned the Good Friday Agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

## Consequences of Brexit
Since leaving, Brexit has not delivered on its promises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. Britain has experienced a significant economic downturn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. The Office for Budget Responsibility estimates a 4% drop in British GDP due to Brexit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. Shortages of EU workers have contributed to inflation and interest rate increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>, and new rules have made trade difficult for many sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. New trade deals have offered minimal benefits, failing to offset the cost of reduced trade with the EU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. It is also harder for British citizens to live and work across the continent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>, and few promised domestic benefits have appeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This has led to growing public discontent, with a clear majority now viewing Brexit as a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

## The Process of Rejoining the EU
Britain cannot simply reverse Brexit; it must rejoin the EU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. This involves a two-part process:

### 1. Procedural Alignment
The UK must ensure full alignment with the EU's body of laws, known as the *acquis communautaire* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. This is expected to be the easier part, given Britain's long history as a member and relatively few divergences since leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

### 2. Political Decision by Member States
The more challenging aspect is the political decision by existing EU members to accept Britain back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. While some senior European figures have expressed openness to the UK rejoining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, leaders will seek assurances of a permanent commitment to prevent another exit process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

This commitment would likely require several factors:
*   **Unequivocal Public Commitment**: The British people must clearly desire membership, demonstrated either by an overwhelming victory for a pro-membership party in a general election or, more likely, a referendum won by a significant margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
*   **Acceptance of Core EU Elements**: Britain would need to sign up to fundamental elements of EU membership, specifically the euro and Schengen, in principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. While immediate adoption wouldn't be required, accepting them as requirements would be a tough pill for many in Britain, even among those in favour of rejoining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

## Challenges and Timeline for Rejoining
Rejoining the EU is not likely to happen soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

*   **Political Party Stance**: Neither of the main political parties (Labour or Conservatives) will include rejoining on their manifestos for the next general election, due by January 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. The Labour Party, currently projected to win, officially aims to "make Brexit work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
*   **Earliest Political Agenda**: Assuming a full five-year parliamentary term, rejoining would realistically only be on the political agenda by 2030 at the earliest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
*   **Negotiation and Ratification**: Even with minimal divergence, talks are estimated to take at least two to three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. Ratification by member states could then take up to an additional two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.
*   **Optimistic Scenario**: Under the most optimistic scenario, rejoining could happen in 2035 at the earliest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

While steps can be taken before then, such as joining EU programs and initiatives like the Single Market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>, this would require a renewed commitment to freedom of movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. This remains a politically sensitive issue for both major parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. The simple reality is that Britain is unlikely to be ready, able, or willing to rejoin the European Union for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.

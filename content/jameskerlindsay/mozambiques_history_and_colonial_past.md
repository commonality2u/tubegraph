Mozambique, located in southeast Africa, boasts a 2,500-kilometer coastline along the Indian Ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:09">[01:21:09]</a>. It spans 800,000 square kilometers (310,000 square miles), making it the 35th largest among the 193 United Nations members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. Its population is approximately 30 million, ranking it 46th globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

The majority of Mozambique's population descends from groups speaking Bantu languages of southern Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. The country also has smaller communities of Europeans, Arabs, South Asians, and Chinese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. Religiously, about half the population is Christian, divided between Catholics and various Protestant churches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. Around 20 percent are believed to be Muslim, though some estimates suggest this figure could be significantly higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. Interestingly, despite Muslims being a minority, Mozambique is one of the 57 members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and the only member from southern Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

## Early History and Islamic Presence

While Mozambique's history stretches back millennia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>, its recorded story significantly begins with the arrival of Muslim traders and travelers in the 10th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. These traders established the first Islamic presence in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.

## The Portuguese Colonial Period

A pivotal development occurred 500 years later (around the 15th century) with the arrival of the Portuguese, who established a trading presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. This presence gradually expanded, leading to the formal establishment of the territory as a colony known as Portuguese East Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.

Unlike many other European powers that began decolonizing their Asian and African territories after the Second World War, Portugal steadfastly resisted, insisting that its colonies were an integral part of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.

## The Fight for Independence

This resistance led to the emergence of a Marxist guerrilla movement, the Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (FRELIMO), in the early 1960s, which aimed to fight against Portuguese rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. FRELIMO was primarily centered in the north and, within a few years, gained control over much of the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. Despite the independence of most neighboring countries, largely from British colonial rule, the Portuguese government refused to relinquish its hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.

Independence for Mozambique ultimately came following a left-wing military coup in Portugal, known as the Carnation Revolution, in April 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. This event led to Portugal's withdrawal from its overseas colonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. On June 25, 1975, Mozambique officially became independent under a FRELIMO government and joined the United Nations later that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.

## Post-Independence Civil War

Just two years after gaining independence, Mozambique plunged into a brutal civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. The Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO), a guerrilla movement backed by South Africa, fought to overthrow the FRELIMO government, which was supported by the Soviet Union and Cuba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. This devastating conflict lasted 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.

The war concluded as the Cold War drew to a close <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>. In 1992, a UN-backed peace deal was signed, leading to multi-party elections two years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>. Despite occasional tensions, including a renewed RENAMO insurgency between 2013 and 2019, Mozambique began a period of development following the end of the civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.

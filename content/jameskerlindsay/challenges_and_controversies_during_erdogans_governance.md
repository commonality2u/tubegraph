For two decades, [[recep_tayyip_erdogans_political_strategy_and_future | Recep Tayyip Erdogan]] has been the dominant figure in Turkish politics, fundamentally transforming the country and its global standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. However, this period has been increasingly marked by his authoritarian rule, steering Turkey in a "troubling direction" both domestically and internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Initial Skepticism and Early Concerns
When [[recep_tayyip_erdogans_political_strategy_and_future | Erdogan]] became prime minister in 2003, many were suspicious of his motives, fearing he would introduce an overtly religious agenda and isolate Turkey from the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>. While he initially focused on European Union membership and related reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>, by 2011, allegations of electoral fraud began to taint the general elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>.

## The Gezi Park Protests: A Turning Point
A significant shift occurred in May 2013, when police violently dispersed protesters attempting to block a park development in Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>. This incident rapidly escalated into widespread, violent nationwide demonstrations involving hundreds of thousands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>. Although the government quelled the unrest, [[erdogans_political_strategies_and_authoritarianism | Erdogan]] responded by clamping down on opposition and becoming increasingly autocratic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>.

## Consolidation of Power and Authoritarianism
Following the protests, [[erdogans_political_strategies_and_authoritarianism | Erdogan's]] focus shifted to consolidating his power. In 2014, he ran for and won the presidency, a role typically ceremonial, and appointed a compliant prime minister to do his bidding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>.

### The 2016 Military Coup Attempt and Its Aftermath
On July 15, 2016, a military coup attempt occurred but quickly collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>. The government responded with a massive crackdown, blaming a dissident religious leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>. This led to thousands being jailed and suspected opponents of the [[erdogans_political_strategies_and_authoritarianism | AKP]] being purged from the civil service, military, judiciary, and higher education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>.

### Constitutional Changes and Executive Presidency
Further consolidating his authority, [[erdogans_political_strategies_and_authoritarianism | Erdogan]] introduced a series of constitutional changes in 2017, later approved by referendum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>. These changes abolished the prime minister's post and created an executive presidency, similar to that of the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>.

## Current Domestic Concerns
Since 2017, significant concerns have continued to grow both within Turkey and internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>. Domestically, Turkey is viewed as a "profoundly illiberal state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>, characterized by:
*   Heavily controlled media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>.
*   Rife human rights abuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>.
*   Serious worries about the democratic system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>.
*   A struggling economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>.
*   Persistent allegations of high-level corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>.
*   [[erdogans_political_strategies_and_authoritarianism | Erdogan's]] growing "megalomania," evidenced by building a massive presidential palace, legislating against insulting the president, and renaming the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>.

## Foreign Policy Divergence
[[erdogans_impact_on_turkish_domestic_and_foreign_policy | Erdogan's foreign policy]] has increasingly diverged from the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>. His growing authoritarianism has effectively ended hopes for Turkish EU membership, with talks halted for the past decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:00">[10:08:00]</a>. There are also concerns about Turkey's reliability as a NATO ally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>.
*   [[erdogans_impact_on_turkish_domestic_and_foreign_policy | Erdogan]] has built ties across the Balkans, Africa, and Central Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>.
*   He has formed a "strange relationship" with Vladimir Putin, including purchasing a Russian anti-aircraft missile system despite U.S. objections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>.
*   Turkey has maintained an ambivalent stance on Ukraine, continuing to trade with Russia even as NATO partners impose sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>.

## Upcoming Elections and Legacy
As Turkey approached the May 2023 elections, many saw it as an opportunity to unseat [[recep_tayyip_erdogans_political_strategy_and_future | Erdogan]] and reverse the constitutional reforms that centralized power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>. Despite a slump in his poll ratings, partly due to the government's perceived failure in handling the devastating 2023 earthquake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:19:00">[11:19:00]</a>, the election remained tight. A coalition of six opposition parties aimed to unseat him, but divisions within the opposition and the presence of other candidates threatened to split the vote, potentially allowing [[recep_tayyip_erdogans_political_strategy and_future | Erdogan]] to remain in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:00">[11:35:00]</a>.

Despite initial positive reforms during his first decade in power, such as attempts to resolve the Cyprus issue, introducing significant domestic political and social reforms, and opening talks with the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a>, [[the_transformation_of_turkey_under_erdogans_leadership | Erdogan's]] second decade has seen Turkey move in a "genuinely worrying direction" both internally and externally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:00">[12:32:00]</a>. This has led to calls for Turkey's expulsion from NATO and a decline in its reputation as a reliable Western ally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a>. While the legacy of the [[the_transformation_of_turkey_under_erdogans_leadership | Erdogan]] era is complex, he has undeniably transformed Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49:00">[12:49:00]</a>.

Over the course of 2023, growing fears have emerged regarding the [[rise_of_sikh_separatist_sentiment_in_india | rise of Sikh separatist sentiment in India]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This battle for an independent Sikh state, known as Khalistan, has a long and violent history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Global Sikh Diaspora

While approximately 22 million Sikhs reside in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, an estimated 3 million more live elsewhere around the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Large Sikh communities are found in Canada, Britain, the United States, and Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Historical International Engagement

From the 1970s, elements within the extensive Sikh diaspora became increasingly vocal in their calls for an independent Sikh Homeland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. This sentiment coalesced in 1980 with the establishment of the National Council of Khalistan by [[modern_developments_and_figures_in_sikh_separatism | Jagjit Singh Chohan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Chohan, a former Punjabi Finance Minister, served as an exile leader for the independence movement from his base in London <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

### Worldwide Attention in 1984

The quest for an independent Punjabi Sikh State gained worldwide attention in 1984 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. This period saw growing international support for independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. The [[impact_of_operation_blue_star_and_1984_antisikh_riots | events of 1984]], including Operation Blue Star, which involved Indian troops storming the Golden Temple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>, and the subsequent assassination of Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>, profoundly affected the Sikh community both in India and abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. Internationally, these events fueled Sikh sentiment and attracted many to the independence cause, igniting the Khalistani movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

### International Terrorist Attack

The heightened international sentiment also tragically led to one of the world's worst terrorist attacks: in 1985, Sikh separatists bombed an Air India flight from Toronto, killing all 329 people on board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

## Diminishing Support and International Clampdown

By the turn of the millennium, the armed campaign for Khalistan in India appeared to be waning, and many Sikhs seemed disillusioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Within the diaspora, the passage of time also seemed to temper feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. The movement for an independent Khalistan appeared to be slowly declining, a process aided by an increasingly aggressive clampdown on Sikh militants by Western governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. For instance, in 2001, Britain proscribed Babbar Khalsa as a terrorist organization, a designation it retains today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:10:02]</a>.

## Recent International Developments

Despite the perceived decline, recent years have seen renewed attention to the international aspects of Sikh separatism.

*   **Sikhs for Justice:** In 2018, the Indian government banned the U.S.-based group "Sikhs for Justice," accusing it of destabilizing the country's peace, unity, and integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   **Diplomatic Missions:** In 2023, the Indian government raised concerns over the security of its diplomatic missions in Canada following large protests outside its Consulate in Vancouver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:33]</a>.
*   **UK Government Report:** A new government commission report in the United Kingdom highlighted a growing pro-Khalistan extremist element within the British Sikh community, much to the anger of community leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:46]</a>.

Although a violent new phase of [[historical_context_of_sikh_separatism_and_khalistan_movement | Sikh separatism]] in Punjab seems unlikely presently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, these international developments demonstrate that the idea of an independent Sikh homeland has not lost its appeal, either in India or abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:13:03]</a>.

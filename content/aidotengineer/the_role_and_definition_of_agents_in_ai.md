## Introduction to AI Engineering and Agents
The field of AI engineering is undergoing rapid development, maturing and spreading across various disciplines [01:19:17]. Historically, AI engineering talks have sought to landmark the state of the industry, from the rise of the AI engineer to the maturation of the discipline [01:05:08]. However, there is ongoing debate about the nature of AI engineering, with some seeing it as an extension of machine learning (ML) with "a few prompts" [01:41:00], and others viewing it primarily as software engineering that calls Large Language Model (LLM) APIs [01:47:00]. It is projected that AI engineering will emerge as its own distinct discipline, with the AI component growing beyond its current 10% share compared to software engineering [01:55:00].

A significant shift in the focus of the AI Engineer Summit has been its pivot to being an [[role_of_ai_agents_and_agentic_frameworks | agent engineering]] conference [02:44:00]. This decision was made based on audience interest, as top-performing talks from the previous year indicated a strong desire for "all the [[role_of_ai_agents_and_agentic_frameworks | agentic things]]" [03:20:00]. This specialization means saying "no" to other areas like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), open models, and GPUs, to concentrate specifically on [[role_of_ai_agents_and_agentic_frameworks | agents]] [02:53:00].

## Defining "Agent"
Before delving into the [[role_of_ai_agents_and_agentic_frameworks | role of AI agents]], it is crucial to define what an agent is [05:25:00]. Perspectives vary depending on the background:
*   **Machine Learning (ML)**: Often views an [[role_of_ai_agents_and_agentic_frameworks | agent]] in terms of reinforcement learning environments, focusing on actions achieving goals [05:41:00].
*   **Software Engineering (SWE)**: Tends to be more reductive, potentially seeing an [[role_of_ai_agents_and_agentic_frameworks | agent]] as a simple "for loop" [05:49:00].

Simon Willison, considered a "patron saint" in the AI engineering community, has crowdsourced over 300 definitions of what an [[role_of_ai_agents_and_agentic_frameworks | agent]] is [06:01:00]. Common themes among these definitions include:
*   Being goal-oriented [06:17:00]
*   Utilizing tools [06:17:00]
*   Involving control flow [06:20:00]
*   Running long processes [06:20:00]
*   Having delegated authority [06:22:00]
*   Completing small, multi-step tasks [06:23:00]

OpenAI also recently released a new definition for [[role_of_ai_agents_and_agentic_frameworks | agents]] [06:52:00], which is expected to influence future developments [07:03:00].

## Why [[development_and_challenges_of_ai_agents | Agents]] are Working Now
The current emergence and effectiveness of [[role_of_ai_agents_and_agentic_frameworks | AI agents]] are attributed to several factors [07:12:00]:

*   **Improved Capabilities**: AI capabilities, particularly in reasoning and tool use, have significantly grown from 2023 to 2025, reaching human baselines around the present time [07:19:00].
*   **Model Diversity**: The market share of OpenAI has diversified, dropping from 95% two years ago to 50% now, with new frontier model labs emerging [07:51:00]. This increased competition is seen as exciting for 2025 [08:05:00].
*   **Reduced Cost of Intelligence**: The cost of GPT-4 level intelligence has decreased by 1,000 times in the last 18 months, making advanced AI more accessible [08:14:00].
*   **RL Fine-tuning Options**: New options for Reinforcement Learning (RL) fine-tuning are becoming available [08:28:00].
*   **[[multiagent_systems_in_ai | Multiagent Systems]]**: Significant work is being done in [[multiagent_systems_in_ai | multi-agents]] [08:49:00].
*   **Faster Inference**: Improvements in hardware are leading to faster inference times [08:50:00].

## [[challenges_and_benefits_of_ai_agents | Challenges and Benefits]]
Despite the excitement, there has been skepticism. Many leaders, including Satya Nadella, Roman, Greg Brockman, and Sam Altman, predict 2025 will be "the year of [[role_of_ai_agents_and_agentic_frameworks | Agents]]" [04:20:00]. However, some were initially skeptical, and the term "agents" was even noted as a buzzword people were tired of hearing [04:48:00]. An interesting reversal occurred, as OpenAI initially advised companies to remove "agents" from their branding but later suggested putting it back on [05:15:00].

### Agent Use Cases and Production
In terms of practical applications, certain [[building_effective_ai_agents | agent use cases]] have found clear product-market fit (PMF):
*   **Coding Agents** [09:12:00]
*   **Support Agents** [09:12:00]
*   **Deep Research Agents** [09:15:00]

However, there are also "anti-use cases" that developers are urged to avoid demonstrating, such as [[role_of_ai_agents_in_workflow_automation | agents that book flights]] or Instacart orders, as users often prefer to handle these tasks themselves [09:24:00].

### Impact on User Growth and [[the_impact_and_future_potential_of_ai_and_agents | Future Potential]]
The growth of AI products, particularly ChatGPT, is tightly linked to reasoning capabilities and the deployment of [[role_of_ai_agents_and_agentic_frameworks | agents]] [10:41:00]. OpenAI reported 400 million users, a 33% growth in three months [09:46:00]. ChatGPT's user base is projected to reach one billion users by the end of the year, quintupling its September usage [10:28:00]. This rapid growth suggests that the ability to ship [[role_of_ai_agents_and_agentic_frameworks | agentic models]] directly correlates with increased user adoption [10:09:00].

The [[role_of_engineering_teams_in_ai_agent_production | role of AI engineering]] is now evolving towards building [[role_of_ai_agents_and_agentic_frameworks | agents]], much like ML engineers build models and software engineers build software [11:00:00]. This shift indicates significant opportunities for those involved in the development and deployment of [[role_of_ai_agents_and_agentic_frameworks | AI agents]] [10:54:00].

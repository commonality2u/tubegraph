Data indicates that specific metropolitan areas are significantly outperforming their general tech market share in the realm of AI.

## San Francisco: Still a Major Hub

San Francisco continues to be a dominant location for startup engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
*   Approximately 29% of all startup engineers are based in San Francisco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
*   While slightly down from a high of 33% in 2013, this figure has been ticking up again since 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
*   For big tech companies, 50% of engineers still reside in the San Francisco Bay Area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

More specifically for AI, San Francisco leads the pack:
*   35% of all engineers in AI reside in San Francisco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   This percentage is greater than Seattle (22%) and New York (10%) combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

## Other Key Locations

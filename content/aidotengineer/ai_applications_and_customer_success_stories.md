This article explores the approaches to [[ai_implementation_and_best_practices | AI implementation]] and highlights several [[case_studies_and_practical_examples_of_AI_implementation | practical examples]] of how Anthropic's large language models are being used to solve real business problems and enhance customer experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The insights shared are based on hundreds of customer interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## About Anthropic
Anthropic is an [[ai_in_enterprise_and_startups | AI safety]] and research company dedicated to building safe and effective large language models (LLMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Founded by leading experts in AI a few years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, they have released multiple iterations of their Frontier models, emphasizing safety techniques, research, and policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

Their most recent model, Sonnet 3.5 new, launched in late October of the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Sonnet is a leading model in the code space, performing at the top of leaderboards for agentic coding evaluations like Sbench <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### Interpretability Research
Anthropic focuses on various research directions, including model capabilities, product research, and [[ai_in_enterprise_and_startups | AI safety]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. A distinguishing area of their research is interpretability, which involves reverse-engineering models to understand how and why they "think" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. This research is still in its early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a> and approaches interpretability in building stages:
*   **Understanding** Grasping AI decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Detection** Understanding specific behaviors and labeling them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **Steering** Influencing the AI's input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   **Explainability** Unlocking business value from interpretability methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

Interpretability aims to significantly improve [[ai_in_enterprise_and_startups | AI safety]], reliability, and usability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. For example, understanding feature activations at the model level can help identify recognized patterns, such as a group of neurons activating when famous NBA players are mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

An example of model steering is "Golden Gate Claude," where the model's activation in the "Golden Gate" direction was amplified. This resulted in Claude suggesting painting a bedroom "red like the Golden Gate Bridge" when asked about bedroom paint colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

## AI Applications and Customer Engagement
Anthropic encourages customers to focus on using [[ai_in_enterprise_and_startups | AI]] to solve core product problems, moving beyond basic applications like chatbots and summarization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. They work closely with [[ai_native_companies | AI-native companies]] and startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

### Examples of AI Applications:
*   **Onboarding and Upskilling Platforms:** Instead of just summarizing course content or providing Q&A chatbots, AI can hyper-personalize course content based on individual employee context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. It can dynamically adapt content to be more challenging for fast learners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a> or update material based on individual learning styles (e.g., creating visual content for visual learners) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   **Diverse Industries:** Anthropic's models are impacting various industries, including taxes, legal, and project management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. These companies are using AI to drastically enhance their [[voice_ai_and_its_applications_in_enhancing_customer_experience | customer experience]], making products easier to use and more trustworthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. This includes achieving high-quality outputs where hallucination is unacceptable, such as in tax preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

## Customer Success Story: Intercom
Intercom, an [[voice_ai_and_its_applications_in_enhancing_customer_experience | AI customer service platform]], has an AI agent called Finn, which is considered a market leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. Anthropic partnered with Intercom to enhance Finn's capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

The collaboration began with a two-week sprint where Anthropic's applied AI team worked with Intercom's data science team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. They compared Intercom's hardest prompt for Finn against a prompt developed with Claude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. Following positive initial results, a two-month optimization sprint was undertaken to fine-tune and optimize all of Intercom's prompts for best performance with Claude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

This effort led to Anthropic's model outperforming the previous LLM in Intercom's benchmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. Intercom then launched "Finn 2," which demonstrated impressive metrics:
*   Can solve up to 86% of customer support volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   51% resolution rate "out of the box" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.
*   Anthropic's own support team adopted Finn and saw similar resolution rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.
*   Enhanced "human element" features, including tone adjustment and answer length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.
*   Improved policy awareness, such as refund policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

Intercom uses a resolution-based pricing model, creating an incentive for the model to be truly helpful in solving customer problems rather than just deflecting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

## Best Practices and Common Mistakes in [[ai_implementation_and_best_practices | AI Implementation]]
Based on their extensive customer interactions, Anthropic has identified common pitfalls and best practices for [[ai_implementation_and_best_practices | AI implementation]]:

### 1. Testing and Evaluation
*   **Common Mistake:** Building a robust workflow and *then* trying to build evaluations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. Evals should direct you toward the desired outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. Other mistakes include struggling with data for eval design, or "trusting the vibes" by only running a few queries without sufficient, representative samples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.
*   **Best Practice:** Understand that evaluations are crucial for empirically navigating the "latent space" of a use case to find an optimized point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. Evals are your "intellectual property" that enable competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.
    *   Set up telemetry for back-testing architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.
    *   Design representative test cases, including "silly examples" that might occur in real-world use (e.g., asking a customer support agent how to kill a zombie in Minecraft) to ensure appropriate model response or rerouting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.

### 2. Identifying Metrics
*   **Common Mistake:** Not clearly defining the balance between intelligence, cost, and latency for a specific use case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. Most organizations can optimize for one or two of these, but rarely all three simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.
*   **Best Practice:** The stakes and time sensitivity of the decision should drive optimization choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. For example:
    *   A customer support use case might prioritize a response within 10 seconds due to customer behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.
    *   A financial research analyst agent can take 10 minutes to respond because the subsequent capital allocation decision is highly important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.
    *   Consider UX approaches to manage latency, such as "thinking boxes" or redirecting users to other pages while the model processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

### 3. Fine-tuning
*   **Common Mistake:** Viewing fine-tuning as a "silver bullet" without understanding its costs or limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>. Fine-tuning can limit a model's reasoning in fields outside the specific fine-tuned domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>. Many attempt fine-tuning without a clear eval set or success criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>.
*   **Best Practice:** Try other approaches *first* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. Fine-tuning should only be considered if intelligence requirements cannot be met otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>. Justify the cost and effort of fine-tuning, and avoid letting it slow down [[ai_product_development_iteration | product development iteration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>.

## Other Methods for AI Performance Improvement
Beyond basic prompt engineering, various other methods and [[ai_application_frameworks_and_architecture | architectural decisions]] can drastically improve the success of an [[ai_in_enterprise_and_startups | AI]] use case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>:
*   **Prompt Caching:** Can significantly reduce cost and increase speed without sacrificing intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>.
*   **Contextual Retrieval:** Improves the effectiveness of retrieval mechanisms, feeding information to the model more efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.
*   **Citations:** An out-of-the-box feature that can be applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>.
*   **Agentic Architectures:** A key architectural decision for advanced AI applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>.

Hubert Mishtella, from Novartis, discusses the [[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents | agentic enterprise]] and what CEOs need to understand about AI, focusing on workflows, networks, and individual perspectives to prepare organizations for the future impact of [[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## The Rise of AI Agents
It is predicted that in as little as three years, organizations could be run by [[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. An [[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents | AI agent]] is defined as a large language model (LLM)-based application that exhibits a certain degree of autonomy in its behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

Key characteristics and capabilities of [[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents | AI agents]] include:
*   **Composition**: They are composed of a language model that integrates and executes specific tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   **Planning**: Execution happens in a step-by-step fashion using different tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   **Adaptability**: The use of tools can be adjusted based on the outcomes of previous steps, known as "dynamic action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   **Advanced Capabilities**: These include reasoning for multi-step planning, adaptability for dynamic work, persistent memory, contextual knowledge (e.g., via Retrieval Augmented Generation), interactive workspaces, and the ability to navigate graphical user interfaces (computer-using agents) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

Companies should already be working on evolving their digital assets to be used as tools for [[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## The Workflow Perspective
A workflow is the execution of a specific process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Technology can be used in two ways:
*   **Automation**: Substituting a specific step with technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
*   **Augmentation**: Making a step quicker or better with technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

While machine learning enabled some automation before, [[agentic_workflows_and_their_levels_of_autonomy | agentic workflows]] represent a significant difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. [[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents | AI agents]] can tackle a broader range of tasks by operating on cognitive steps, acting as a "glue" to compose tasks together without human intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This enables the automation and delegation of not just one, but multiple steps in a process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

To build [[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents | agents]], organizations must first identify their workflows and deeply understand the context around them, including data, systems, transformations, and steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. This context is often implicit, residing in employees' heads or distributed across teams and systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

## The Network and Persona Perspective
Relying solely on traditional roles and job titles is insufficient for applying [[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents | AI agents]] effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. To leverage [[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents | AI agents]], it's crucial to understand the specific tools, planning, and behavioral conditions required for each task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

A more helpful approach is to define different "archetypes" or "personas" for contributors within a workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. Examples of such personas include:
*   **Silent Achiever**: High performance with lower communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   **Individual Contributor**: Strong in both communication and performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
*   **Connector**: Links non-adjacent teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
*   **Multiplier**: Enhances the work of other team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Knowledge Hub**: Provides domain expertise or necessary information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

Defining personas helps project how [[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents | AI agents]] might impact workflows and employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. For example, a silent achiever with access to a coding assistant could become so productive they can perform work previously requiring multiple people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. Similarly, an [[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents | AI agent]] can magnify a multiplier's impact across the entire team, and knowledge hubs are particularly prone to substitution by [[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents | AI agents]] that can dynamically support all team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

Understanding these archetypes at a global organizational level allows for identifying common patterns across different workflows, leading to optimized agent development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.

## Emerging Patterns and New Roles
The advent of [[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents | AI agents]] brings about several emerging patterns:
*   **Commoditization of Intelligence and Domain Knowledge**: These become cheap and easily available, no longer a primary edge for employees or companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.
*   **Shift in Employee Focus**: Employees and companies need to pivot towards multi-disciplinary know-how or much deeper specialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.
*   **Increased Value of Context Understanding**: This will gain more value compared to mere intelligence or domain expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.
*   **AI Supercharges "Doers"**: People who perform tasks can do even more and quicker, potentially becoming "10x" or even "100x" engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.
*   **Polarization of Positions**: There will be less "middle ground," leading to new specializations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>.

New roles are expected to appear in AI-mature organizations, such as:
*   Workflow Miner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>
*   Human-[[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents | AI Orchestrator]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>

## Enabling AI Adoption
To enable widespread adoption and democratization of [[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents | AI agents]] within an organization, a phased approach is essential:
1.  **General Assistants**: Provide access to common [[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents | AI assistants]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.
2.  **Individual Assistants**: Offer personalized assistants per employee, with memory, context understanding, and personal databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>.
3.  **Employee-Built Agents**: Empower employees to quickly build their own agents using coding assistants, low-code, or no-code tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. This requires "cognitive self-awareness" from employees to translate their mental steps into defined actions for an agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>.
4.  **Digital Twins**: Create "digital twins" of employees to retain organizational knowledge and expertise, allowing for "time travel" to reconstruct past processes and ask questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.
5.  **Multi-Employee Agents**: Develop [[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents | agents]] that serve entire teams or workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>.
6.  **Swarm of Agents**: Progress towards interconnected swarms of [[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents | agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.

This progression is enabled by the maturing software stack around LLMs and [[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.

## Challenges and Opportunities
### Challenges
*   **Adoption**: A significant [[challenges_in_aidriven_architecture_design | challenge]] is cultural readiness for [[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents | AI agents]] to drive interactions and delegate subtasks *to* humans, rather than humans delegating to agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.
*   **Ethics of Autonomy**: As machines gain more freedom, they will require clearly defined moral standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>. This includes defining the values [[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents | AI agents]] should uphold and resolving potential conflicts between humans and AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>. This necessitates engaging with morality, ethics, and philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>.

### Opportunities
[[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents | AI agents]] present interesting opportunities, such as:
*   Simulating synthetic reality before real-life activities in marketing or labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>.
*   Proactively understanding regulatory loopholes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>.
*   Finding merger and acquisition (M&A) opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>.

True AI is built incrementally, with every step verified and refined through collaborative effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Manish Sanwal, Director of AI at Newscorp, focuses on AI reasoning, explainability, and automation, aiming to build AI that is smarter, more structured, and self-correcting using Layered [[chain_of_thought_reasoning_in_ai | Chain of Thought reasoning]] with [[agent_frameworks_and_orchestration_layers_in_ai_engineering | multi-agentic systems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Multi-Agentic Systems: The Foundation

[[agent_frameworks_and_orchestration_layers_in_ai_engineering | Multi-agentic systems]] are collections of specialized AI agents that collaborate to tackle complex tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Each agent is designed to handle a specific part of an overall problem, rather than relying on massive, monolithic systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

**Advantages of Multi-Agentic Systems:**
*   **Specialization** Each agent can be finely tuned for a specific task, leading to improved accuracy and performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Flexibility and Scalability** Individual agents can be updated or improved without overhauling the entire system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, contributing to [[building_scalable_ai_systems | building scalable AI systems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Reliability and Fault Tolerance** If one agent encounters an issue, others can often compensate, ensuring the overall system remains reliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

By integrating these well-coordinated agents, a system becomes inherently more robust and effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. When [[chain_of_thought_reasoning_in_ai | Chain of Thought reasoning]] is incorporated, each agent not only performs its task but also explains its decision-making process step by step, enhancing transparency and resiliency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Understanding Chain of Thought (CoT)

[[chain_of_thought_reasoning_in_ai | Chain of Thought]] is a method that guides AI to think through a problem step by step, rather than simply guessing an answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Traditionally, Large Language Models (LLMs) are given a detailed prompt and asked for a final answer, often jumping directly to a conclusion without revealing their reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

[[chain_of_thought_prompting | Chain of Thought prompting]] asks the model to outline every step of its reasoning process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. By breaking down a complex problem into manageable steps, the model demonstrates how it processes information and the path it takes to reach a conclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

**Key Benefits of Traditional CoT:**
*   **Transparency:** Users can see each stage of the reasoning process, which helps in understanding how the model tracks the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   **Opportunity for Fine-tuning and Debugging:** If a mistake is spotted in an intermediate step, the prompt or process can be adjusted to correct errors before the final answer is provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

In essence, [[chain_of_thought_reasoning_in_ai | Chain of Thought]] transforms the AI's internal reasoning into a viable and verifiable sequence, making the entire process more interpretable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

### Limitations of Traditional CoT

While [[chain_of_thought_reasoning_in_ai | Chain of Thought]] makes AI reasoning transparent, it comes with several limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>:
*   **Prompt Sensitivity:** The process is highly sensitive to how prompts are phrased; even slight changes can lead to vastly different outputs, complicating reproducibility and reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
*   **Lack of Real-time Feedback:** There is no built-in mechanism to verify or correct mistakes during the step-by-step reasoning process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **Cascade of Errors:** If an early inference is flawed, it can cause a cascade of errors that compromises the integrity of the entire process, as there are no ongoing checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **Incomplete Conclusions:** When faced with problems involving multiple interdependent factors, [[chain_of_thought_reasoning_in_ai | Chain of Thought]] can sometimes miss critical connections, leading to oversimplified or incomplete conclusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

These [[challenges_in_building_reliable_ai_agents | challenges in building reliable AI agents]] stem from its sensitivity to prompt design, lack of real-time feedback, and unverified reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

## Layered Chain of Thought (LCoT) Prompting

Layered [[chain_of_thought_prompting | Chain of Thought prompting]], or "layered CoT," is designed to overcome the limitations of standard [[chain_of_thought_reasoning_in_ai | Chain of Thought]] methods by integrating a verification step at every stage of the reasoning process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

This approach works in two steps:

1.  **Generation of Initial Thought:** An AI agent produces an initial thought, which is the first piece of reasoning generated from the input prompts. At this stage, the model formulates an early hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
2.  **Verification Against Knowledge Base:** Before moving on, the generated thought is immediately verified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. This involves cross-referencing the output against a structured knowledge base or an external database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. This verification might include a fact-checking algorithm, a consistency check through contextual reasoning, or an ensemble model to check for accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. This step ensures that only accurate and reliable information influences subsequent reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

This is an iterative process: a new thought is repeatedly generated, verified, and then processed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. The chain of reasoning is built step by step, with each link confirmed before the next is added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

### Benefits of Layered CoT

The additional verification step offers significant advantages:
*   **Self-Correction:** Verification at each step allows the system to catch and correct errors early, preventing mistakes from propagating through the entire reasoning chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   **Robustness Against Prompt Variability:** Because each step is independently verified, the overall process becomes less sensitive to small changes in input, leading to higher reproducibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   **Increased Trustworthiness:** Each verified step ensures the final output is built on a foundation of accurate and validated information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Transparency:** Breaking down reasoning into discrete, verifiable steps makes the AI thought process much more transparent, allowing for easier auditing and interpretation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

Layered [[chain_of_thought_reasoning_in_ai | Chain of Thought]] transforms AI reasoning into a robust, iterative framework where every step is checked for accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. This approach mitigates the inherent weaknesses of traditional [[chain_of_thought_reasoning_in_ai | Chain of Thought]] and leads to more reliable, reproducible, and interpretable AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

## Conclusion

Layered [[chain_of_thought_prompting | Chain of Thought prompting]] overcomes the limitations of traditional [[chain_of_thought_reasoning_in_ai | CoT]] by adding a verification step after each thought generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. This method can be seamlessly implemented using existing LLM tools and integrates perfectly within [[agent_frameworks_and_orchestration_layers_in_ai_engineering | multi-agentic systems]], where each specialized agent contributes to a robust overall system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. Layered CoT enhances both accuracy and reproducibility by ensuring every inference is validated before proceeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

The future of AI is not just about building bigger models, but about creating systems that are structured, explainable, and reliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. Prioritizing transparency, self-correction, collaboration, and validation lays the foundation for truly trustworthy AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

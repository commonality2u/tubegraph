Munir, CEO and co-founder of Porsche AI, shares insights from his journey as a recent founder of an AI startup, drawing on his previous product roles at big tech companies like Stripe, Google, and Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Porsche AI, co-founded with Emma, is an open-source SDK for building production agents with a focus on regulated industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## [[user_problems_and_discovery_in_ai_startups | User Problems and Discovery]] in AI Startups

User problem identification and discovery in AI is significantly different from traditional tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **Undefined Problems** Conventional user problems often have a discernible shape and adjacency to known issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. However, in AI, users frequently don't know what their problems are; instead, user problems emerge as a property of the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. This is akin to starting a "Soulslike game" where "nothing makes sense at first" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   **Rapid Change** The capabilities of the technology are evolving extremely quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. This means traditional three-to-six-month roadmaps are not effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. Instead, companies must make directional bets and iterate very rapidly by releasing products and observing user reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **Hypothesis-Driven Iteration** The anchor for focus becomes hypothesis-driven, deliberate iteration, rather than conventional roadmaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Creating Narratives** Unlike traditional user storyboards and critical user journeys, these tools often feel obsolete in the AI space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. It's more like "No Man's Sky," where you have to create your own narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Founders must help users overcome initial inertia, work with them to create narratives, and anchor on specific use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This process eventually leads to more familiar territory where product refinement can occur against tangible problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

## Velocity as a Table Stakes

The product development process in a small AI startup can be incredibly gratifying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **Rapid Development Cycle** Unlike large organizations requiring numerous sign-offs, a small team can go from an idea to a released product—including spec, design, testing, and release—within a few hours or days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   **Critical Importance of Velocity** In AI, velocity is not merely a "nice to have"; it is "table stakes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. The inability to release quickly and effectively means being "out of the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
*   **Seizing Opportunities** Opportunities that allow a company to stand out and accelerate its growth appear and disappear very quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Examples include new standards like MCP, agent-to-agent protocols, or diffusion models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. It's crucial to react swiftly and build products at the forefront of these technological breakthroughs to grow brand and cement presence in the developer or user community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

## Outreach, Awareness, and Adoption

One of the toughest aspects of starting an AI company is the lack of scaffolding for outreach, awareness, traffic, and adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   **Navigating Hype and Noise** The AI space is currently in "full-on hype and meme wars," making it difficult to discern signal from noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.
*   **Lack of Brand Advantage** Without the advantages of a larger brand, it feels like playing "Crash Bandicoot" without boosters or "Mario Kart" without items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
*   **Building Advocacy** Unlike launching a product at a major company where a single tweet from leadership can generate awareness, startups must find advocates and credible industry voices to speak on their behalf and act as force multipliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. People primarily follow people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   **Strategic Partnerships** To build brand awareness and drive traffic without a large company's established channels, finding allies is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. These allies can be other startups at a similar stage or slightly ahead, interested in the same space with synergy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Partnering, cross-marketing, and cross-selling are vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. Even having a product listed in the integration documentation of another company (e.g., BrowserBase) can be a significant channel to drive users to your website or GitHub repository <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

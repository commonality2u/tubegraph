During a "Frontier Feud" competition held in New York City, a survey of 100 AI Engineers was conducted to identify common sentiments within the industry, including which buzzwords people are tired of hearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

## Buzzwords AI Engineers are Tired of Hearing

When asked to "name a buzzword everyone in AI is tired of hearing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53">[13:53]</a>, the survey revealed several terms that AI professionals are fatigued by:

*   **Agents** While considered a very good guess, "agents" was not the top answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56">[13:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:15">[15:15]</a>. This term is often related to [[function_calling_in_ai | function calling]] and autonomous AI systems.
*   **Multimodality** This buzzword was suggested but did not appear on the survey's official board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:56">[14:56]</a>.
*   **Co-pilots** Another suggested term, but it was not among the top answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:12">[15:12]</a>.
*   **AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)** This was identified as the number one answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:30">[15:30]</a>, indicating widespread fatigue with the term among AI engineers.
*   **Deep Seek** This term was suggested but was not on the survey's board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53">[15:53]</a>.
*   **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)** This was listed among the additional answers of terms people are sick of hearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:21">[16:21]</a>.
*   **Prompt Engineering** Similarly, "prompt engineering" was also identified as a buzzword that AI engineers are tired of hearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:25">[16:25]</a>.

### Related Concepts and Discussion

The survey also touched upon other aspects of the AI industry, including:

*   **Influential AI Researchers**: The survey asked participants to name the most [[influential_ai_researchers | influential AI researcher]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27">[05:27]</a>.
*   **AI Tools**: In a "fast money" round, participants were asked to name an [[tool_usage_and_development_in_ai_frameworks | AI tool]] that engineers love, with "Cursor" being the number one answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:29">[17:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:04">[18:04]</a>.

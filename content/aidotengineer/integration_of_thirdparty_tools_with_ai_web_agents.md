Retriever.com, an AI web agent implemented as a Chrome extension, offers advanced [[ai_integration_and_tool_calling | AI integration and tool calling]] capabilities that extend beyond simple web interactions, allowing for seamless [[role_of_ai_agents_in_workflow_automation | workflow automation]] by connecting with various third-party tools and APIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Dynamic Function Calling
Retriever emphasizes a dynamic [[importance_of_tool_calling_for_ai_agents | function calling]] approach, distinguishing itself from systems that rely on a predefined set of connectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. Users can define and set up custom function calls, allowing the AI agent to interact with virtually any API or third-party tool by providing the necessary information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. This makes Retriever's [[integration_of_tool_calling_in_agent_frameworks | integration of tool calling in agent frameworks]] highly extensible and scalable compared to competitors that build custom, limited integrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.

### Example: WhatsApp Integration
A practical demonstration of Retriever's capabilities involves its [[ai_integration_and_tool_calling | integration]] with WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. By selecting a Google Sheet containing customer phone numbers, a user can prompt Retriever to send messages to those numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. The AI agent identifies each number and invokes the WhatsApp tool to send the messages, confirming success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. This functionality demonstrates the potential for automating social communications across platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp with a single click <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

## Advantages for Productivity
Retriever is focused on [[developing_ai_agents_for_productivity | productivity]] and [[role_of_ai_agents_in_workflow_automation | workflow automation]], seeing AI as a perfect solution for automating manual and repetitive tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. By facilitating advanced [[automation_of_web_tasks_using_ai_web_agents | automation of web tasks using AI web agents]] and third-party integrations, it significantly reduces the burden of such tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

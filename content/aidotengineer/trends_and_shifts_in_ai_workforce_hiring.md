Heath Black, Managing Director of Product at SignalFire, shares insights gleaned from SignalFire's proprietary AI/ML platform, Beacon, regarding current trends and shifts in AI workforce hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Beacon tracks over 650 million employees, 80 million companies, and 200 million open-source projects, enabling SignalFire to build ranking systems and market insights to power their firm and support portfolio companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

This data is used to identify the right people, in the right locations, at the right time, and close them with the right narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

## Dcredentialization in AI Hiring
One significant trend observed over the last decade is a stark "de-credentialization" in AI hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. AI startups are increasingly hiring engineers without PhDs or degrees from prestigious schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

In 2015:
*   27% of engineer hires were from top schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
*   16% had PhDs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

By 2023:
*   These numbers declined by approximately 50%, with 15% from top schools and 7% with PhDs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

Even for research scientists, less than half (about 40%) hold advanced degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. This shift reflects a change in market focus from foundational ML research (around 2015) to applying models to real-world usage, emphasizing ML Ops, product experience, and understanding user interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

> [!tip] Hiring Implications
> *   Work experience now far surpasses education in importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Focus on the body of work, including open-source contributions for new workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
> *   Assess if a PhD researcher is truly necessary or if an experienced engineer will suffice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
> *   Consider removing or softening academic requirements in job postings to attract experienced talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

## Talent Mobility and Location
There has been a significant shift in [[the_role_of_location_in_ai_talent_concentration | AI talent concentration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Historically, AI talent was centered at large tech companies like Google, Uber, Meta, and Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Over time, this talent has concentrated in nine companies collectively referred to as the "AI V-League" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Interestingly, traditional tech giants are now actively recruiting from these AI V-League companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

Beacon also tracks net employee movement between AI V-League companies. For example, OpenAI has a positive flow of talent from DeepMind, while Cohere shows a negative trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. Understanding where people are coming from and where they are going is crucial for effective filtering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

Despite debates about its demise, San Francisco remains a leading hub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>:
*   San Francisco makes up about 29% of all startup engineers, slightly down from 33% in 2013, but ticking up since 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
*   New York and Seattle have doubled their market share of engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   50% of big tech engineers still reside in the San Francisco Bay Area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

Specifically for AI:
*   San Francisco leads, with 35% of all AI engineers residing there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   Seattle accounts for 22%, and New York for 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
*   These three cities disproportionately attract [[ai_engineering_trends | AI talent]] and funding, with San Francisco accounting for nearly 38% of all early-stage funding into AI startups in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

> [!tip] Location and Funding Markets
> *   [[the_role_of_location_in_ai_talent_concentration | Location]] still matters, even in a distributed world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. San Francisco, Seattle, and New York are premier locations for AI talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
> *   Monitor location and funding markets to see where talent and capital are flowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

## Timing in Recruitment
Effective recruitment involves finding the right people at the right time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. This means identifying when individuals are most likely to leave their current roles and when they are likely to join a company at your stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

Analyzing retention rates of AI V-League companies can help identify "poachability scores" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. For example, Anthropic has about a 66% four-year retention rate, while Perplexity hovers around 43-44% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.

Generational behavior also plays a role:
*   In 2023, nearly 27% of Gen Z left their jobs, more than double the rate for Gen X <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
*   Within four years of graduating, Gen Z averages 2.2 jobs, compared to 1.1 for Gen X <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. This may be due to slower promotion rates, market layoffs, or a greater willingness of Gen Z to take risks and bet on themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.

SignalFire's "historical composition" tool provides insights into target companies' organizational structures at different points in time, revealing who the first engineers were, or who led sales growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. This helps in understanding a candidate's risk profile, motivations, and potential as a "10x hire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

> [!tip] Strategic Timing
> *   Understand when competitors are likely to lose people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.
> *   Track changes in target profiles to identify potential shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.
> *   Study generational patterns of job changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.
> *   Know when people join and leave companies to identify 10xers and those likely to join your stage of company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.

## Crafting the Narrative Beyond Compensation
Relying solely on pay and equity as recruitment narratives is no longer sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>.
*   From November 2022 to November 2024, the average tech salary increased by only 1.6%, with a sharp decline in equity granted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.
*   [[future_trends_in_ai_agent_pricing | AI Engineers]] are in high demand, commanding a 5% salary premium and a 10-20% equity premium over other engineering roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. This makes already expensive roles even more costly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.
*   The use of equity as a selling point has declined due to concerns over valuations, the cost of liquid capital to exercise shares, and rapid market shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. In Q2 2024, only 33% of people exercised vested shares, down from 55% a couple of years earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.

Companies must focus on non-monetary aspects of their narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>:
*   A close-knit environment and collaboration with founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.
*   Speed and lack of friction in getting work done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>.
*   A big mission and opportunities for career growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>.
*   Exploding markets and the chance to solve complex problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.

Drawing on Kurt Vonnegut's concept of story shapes, companies should understand their own narrative arcâ€”their triumphs, where they are today, and where they are going <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. This enables a compelling story that goes beyond compensation alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.

> [!tip] Narrative Strategy
> *   Salary and equity should not be the sole selling points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>.
> *   Articulate the unique non-financial benefits and opportunities your company offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.
> *   Understand and communicate your company's story arc to attract top talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.

## Conclusion
In a competitive landscape where many companies are "fishing in the same engineering pond," using recruiting data provides a significant edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>. Just as data is used to build products and models, it should be leveraged to build effective teams, as the team itself is a company's most valuable product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.

Key takeaways for [[building_and_recruiting_ai_teams | recruiting AI talent]]:

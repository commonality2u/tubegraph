The fourth pattern of AI-native development focuses on capturing and organizing knowledge derived from the development process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. This ensures that past problems are not repeated and valuable insights are retained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

## Sources of Knowledge

Knowledge can be derived from various aspects of the software development lifecycle:

### Production Issues
Learning from experiences in production is crucial. Information gathered from [[development_and_deployment_of_observability_platforms | production environments]] can be used to inform and improve code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

### Incident Response
Analysis of incidents provides valuable lessons on what failed and what practices or technologies to avoid or improve upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

### Codebase as Lessons
Existing code can be transformed into lessons, which is particularly useful for reducing the onboarding time for new team members or preserving knowledge when someone leaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Much knowledge is typically lost in these transitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

### Feature Memory and Decisions
It's common for features to be tried, dismissed, and then re-attempted later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. By maintaining a "feature memory," teams can track past decisions and avoid redoing work or repeating mistakes. Decisions, often scattered across tickets or architecture diagrams, can be centrally captured as organized knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

## AI's Role in Knowledge Capture

[[Integration of AI into Development Environments and Editors | AI can facilitate]] the capture of knowledge directly within the workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. As developers chat and code, an [[agentic_editors_in_software_development | AI agent]] can identify and prompt the saving of important information as knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. This creates a beneficial loop where both humans and AI learn concurrently, fostering continuous knowledge retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

> "when we actually do this more in the flow we we chat we we code and all of a sudden the agent says I think this is important let's save this as knowledge we kind of get a very beneficial loop I both for actually the the human and both for the eye to kind of learn at the same time and keeping that like knowledge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>

## Benefits of Organized Knowledge
Organized knowledge serves multiple purposes:
*   **Assisting Others**: It helps other team members with their questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.
*   **Improving Solutions**: It contributes to improving the coding of solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

This pattern, along with others, demonstrates that [[Impact of AI on development workflow | AI's impact on development workflow]] extends beyond mere coding assistance, moving developers into roles traditionally associated with operations, QA, architecture, product ownership, and data engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. This shift allows developers to act more like senior developers who engage in broader activities beyond just writing code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

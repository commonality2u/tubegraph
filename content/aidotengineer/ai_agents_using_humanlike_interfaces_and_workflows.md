Hai, a company founded by Steven Moon, is focused on [[ai_agents_and_agentic_workflows | building Enterprise AI agents]] that operate within existing security boundaries, leveraging decades of enterprise infrastructure rather than creating parallel systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The primary challenge in [[developing_ai_agents_and_agentic_workflows | deploying AI agents]] is ensuring these "digital workers" respect enterprise security, compliance, and established workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## A New Computing Paradigm

As AI Engineers, we are witnessing a unique moment where software applications can understand humans directly and use the same interfaces as people do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a new computing paradigm, enabling [[ai_agents_and_agentic_workflows | AI agents]] to reason requests, understand context, and interact naturally through existing channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## The Pitfall of Parallel Systems

Despite this potential, the current trend in [[developing_ai_agents_and_agentic_workflows | deploying AI agents]] in enterprises often falls back into old patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Each new [[ai_agents_and_agentic_workflows | AI agent]] frequently becomes another external system, requiring new portals, credentials, and security reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Instead of embracing the new paradigm where agents interact like humans, many approaches are inadvertently building more barriers between users and new capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

Sacha Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, observed a "fundamental shift" in business software, suggesting that "SaaS is dead," implying that [[ai_agents_and_agentic_workflows | AI agents]] will become the primary way users interact with business systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Yet, many organizations are still building new [[ai_agents_and_agentic_workflows | AI agent]] portals and dashboards, recreating an obsolete pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Enterprise AI Agents as Employees

Ideally, enterprise [[ai_agents_and_agentic_workflows | AI agents]] should function like any other employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This means:
*   Following security policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>
*   Using approved systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>
*   Staying within data boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>
*   Accessing only necessary information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>
*   Being monitored and audited like human staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>

The good news is that enterprises already possess the necessary infrastructure: secure compute environments, identity management, data governance, compliance frameworks, and audit capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. These systems, refined over decades, allow for the execution of [[ai_agents_and_agentic_workflows | AI agents]] within existing private clouds and security boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Modern AI infrastructure supports running agents in private clouds, keeping data within tenants, utilizing existing security controls, leveraging current workflows, and maintaining complete oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. The technology is available to deploy AI with the same privacy controls applied to human employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

> "Every time we reflexively create a new interface for [[ai_agents_and_agentic_workflows | AI agents]], we're potentially solving yesterday's problem. We're building translation layers between humans and machines at exactly the moment when machines can finally understand us directly." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>

Before creating new portals or dashboards, the question should be whether the new capability can be delivered through systems users already know and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

## Leveraging Existing Enterprise Infrastructure

AI engineers often overlook the power of existing enterprise infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Platforms like Microsoft 365 are battle-tested and integrated into enterprises' security and compliance frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. By [[building_effective_ai_agents | building effective AI agents]] on these platforms, they inherit the trust and infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### The IT Department as HR for AI Agents

Jensen Wong's observation that "the IT department of every company is going to be the HR department of [[ai_agents_and_agentic_workflows | AI agents]] in the future" perfectly captures this transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. IT teams can provision [[ai_agents_and_agentic_workflows | AI agent]] accounts using existing Active Directory tools, apply standard security policies, set permissions via familiar interfaces, and use current audit and monitoring tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. This means no new systems to learn; [[ai_agents_and_agentic_workflows | AI agents]] are managed like any other employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. The IT department thus becomes the HR department for the [[ai_agents_and_agentic_workflows | AI workforce]], managing onboarding, access, commissions, and monitoring through familiar systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### Agent-to-Agent Communication

Email provides a powerful pattern for agent-to-agent communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Just as humans use email for collaboration, [[ai_agents_and_agentic_workflows | AI agents]] can email each other to share data and coordinate work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This ensures:
*   Every interaction is fully logged and auditable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
*   Permissions are automatically enforced through existing systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   Data flows are transparent and controllable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

This framework allows for [[building_effective_ai_agents | building effective AI agents]] that are observable and controllable at enterprise scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. While Microsoft's ecosystem is one example, these patterns are applicable to Google Workspace or other enterprise platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

## Conclusion

The key insight for AI Engineers is the ability to leverage existing enterprise infrastructure rather than building parallel systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. These platforms offer built-in identity management, established security controls, proven compliance frameworks, and enterprise-grade APIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. This approach allows engineers to focus on [[building_effective_ai_agents | building new capabilities]] and solving new problems, instead of reinventing infrastructure that already functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

The future of Enterprise AI is not about building new interfaces for agents, but about enhancing existing systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. By choosing universal and trusted methods like email, or by integrating with existing document management systems, internal messaging platforms, and workflow tools, organizations can rethink [[implementing_ai_agents_in_daily_operations | AI agent integration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

Since software agents can now directly understand human intent, each existing system becomes a potential gateway for [[ai_agents_and_agentic_workflows | AI capabilities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. This represents a fundamental shift in how enterprises approach [[implementing_ai_agents_in_daily_operations | AI adoption]] and application development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Instead of asking what new tools are needed, the focus shifts to which existing systems can be enhanced with [[ai_agents_and_agentic_workflows | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. The most powerful solutions may not be new interfaces, but rather the "quiet intelligence" added to tools customers already trust and use daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

The era of mandatory translation layers between humans and machines is ending, giving way to direct understanding and seamless [[ai_agents_and_agentic_workflows | AI collaboration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

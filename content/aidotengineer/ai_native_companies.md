**AI native companies** are organizations fundamentally built with AI agents at their core, not merely as an add-on feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. This contrasts sharply with [[ai_enhanced_vs_ai_native_organizations | AI-enhanced businesses]] that might use AI for efficiency but could still function without it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. In an AI native model, AI is an engine driving product, operations, and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

## Defining AI Native

An **AI native company** is built from the ground up with AI agents integral to everything, augmenting human productivity and intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. AI is embedded into the foundation of their product, operations, and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. If AI agents were removed from such a company, employees would be significantly less productive, bogged down by mundane tasks, and unable to move as fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Their products would feel old, unintelligent, and less useful, failing to offer the 10x or 100x customer empowerment that AI provides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

In essence, an AI native business operates like a car on autopilot, directed by humans, rather than a car with only driver assist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Every employee focuses on higher-level navigation and company success, while routine tasks and micro-decisions are offloaded to AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

This [[patterns_of_ai_native_development | AI native model]] is not just a tech trend; it redefines team building, workflow design, and even hiring roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

## Characteristics of an AI Native Company

While still in early stages, several defining attributes characterize an AI native company:

### AI at the Core of Everything
AI is not confined to one team or feature; it permeates every aspect, including product development, customer support, and operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Each department is expected to have agents performing routine and key daily work, with integrated interfaces for seamless handoffs between departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

### Humans as Conductors
In an AI native environment, people transition from being "cogs in a machine" to "conductors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. This requires a different hiring profile and company organizational chart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

*   **Flatter, Leaner Structure:** Organizations become flatter and leaner, with middle management layers shrinking as intelligent systems handle coordination and execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
*   **Rapid Development:** Teams can prototype ideas and get refined requirements in hours, with agents contributing to messaging, copy, and documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.
*   **Networked Organization:** The future organizational chart is envisioned as a network of humans and AI working together, rather than a traditional pyramid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

### Experimentation and Iterative Culture
An iterative, experimental culture is ingrained in the company's DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. With AI handling routine tasks and aiding in prototyping, humans can truly focus on what matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. Agents that learn and improve over time, such as Cognition's Devine, become powerful tools, documenting code and understanding company processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

These attributes — AI at the core, humans as orchestrators, rapid experimentation, and self-learning agent evolution — combine to create an organization that feels entirely different from a traditional company, operating on a completely new model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

## The Typical AI Native Workday

A significant new aspect of the workday in an AI native company is overseeing what AI agents are doing or have done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

*   **Morning Routine:** A typical morning might involve checking on agent activities, reviewing progress, and kicking off new tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. For instance, speaking to a language model like ChatGPT to kick off bigger thinking tasks, which might then lead to agents like "Devon" creating pull requests for bugs or documentation issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.
*   **Human-Agent Collaboration:** Employees act as "lead manager types" for their AI agent counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. This includes orchestrating "content marketing swarms" of multiple agents to optimize copy, determine social posting times, and schedule automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. This approach leverages human expertise with async workloads, preparing tasks for review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

This leads to flatter team structures and new job titles that combine domain expertise with AI know-how, such as "AI Engineer" or "AI Customer Lead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

## Rethinking Hiring for AI Native Companies

The shift to an AI native model necessitates a rethinking of the hiring process and the types of individuals hired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.

### AI Fluency as a Must-Have
Curiosity and adaptability become highly demanded traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. **AI fluency** becomes a mandatory skill, similar to expecting an office worker to know how to use a word processor and keyboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. Companies will seek candidates efficient at directly guiding agents, utilizing their expertise through these agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. Skepticism arises if candidates are unfamiliar with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.

### New Leadership Qualities
For leadership roles, the focus shifts to whether candidates understand how to use and integrate agents and can bring in people with AI fluency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.

### Onboarding for an Agent-Native Environment
Onboarding processes will also change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. New hires might spend their initial weeks solely focused on setting up their agents to perform their job effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>. It may even be reasonable to attach an engineer to a new team to ensure their agents are properly set up and running <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.

## A Profound Shift and Unfair Advantage

The transition to AI native companies represents a profound shift, much like the industrial revolution or the advent of the car industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. AI agents are expected to be deeply embedded in every aspect of business, requiring a rethinking of roles, skills, culture, and operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.

This shift moves businesses from merely using AI as a tool to being built around AI as a core primitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. An example of this impact is the ability to build an entire agent cloud infrastructure from scratch in just a few weeks with a small team, a feat considered unheard of previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>.

Experienced founders and tech leaders are challenged to fully embrace this paradigm shift, potentially needing to "check some of that experience at the door" and critically rethink what remains valid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>. As PWC noted, companies only using AI for small efficiency gains are falling behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

The call to action for businesses is to start from first principles, reimagine, and refit their company and culture for this future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>. This means rewiring processes so that human-to-agent teams can scale impact exponentially, redesigning organizational charts, redefining roles, and rethinking hiring skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. While this involves significant change and potential friction, it also offers an "unfair advantage" to those who adopt it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>.

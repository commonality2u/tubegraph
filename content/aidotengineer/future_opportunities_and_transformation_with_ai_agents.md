Hbert Mishtella, who leads AI researchers in drug design at Novardis, presented at the AI Engineer World's Fair 2025 on the topic of "Agentic Enterprise: What your CEO must know about AI" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The presentation covered various angles of AI, including workflows, networks, and individual perspectives, focusing on how organizations can prepare for the future impact of [[future_of_ai_agent_ecosystems | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

Organizations may be run by [[the_impact_and_future_potential_of_ai_and_agents | AI agents]] in as little as three years, a statement considered realistic given the current pace of AI development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Defining AI Agents
An [[the_impact_and_future_potential_of_ai_and_agents | AI agent]] is an application based on a large language model (LLM) that exhibits a degree of autonomy in its behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. They use an LLM to "glue together" specific functions, executing steps with planning and dynamically adjusting tool usage based on previous outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This capability provides a new level of functionality previously almost exclusive to humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

To leverage [[the_impact_and_future_potential_of_ai_and_agents | AI agents]], companies should work on evolving their digital assets to be used as tools for or even as [[the_impact_and_future_potential_of_ai_and_agents | AI agents]] themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

### Key Capabilities of AI Agents
[[building_effective_ai_agents | AI agents]] offer several capabilities that enable complex tasks:
*   **Multi-step Planning and Reasoning** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>
*   **Adaptability for Dynamic Work** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>
*   **Persistent Memory** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>
*   **Contextual Knowledge** (e.g., Retrieval Augmented Generation or RAG for specific knowledge not in the LLM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>
*   **Interactive Workspaces** (e.g., sandboxes or canvases for iterative collaboration on tasks like code or art) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>
*   **Computer Vision** (allowing agents to navigate graphical user interfaces and automate steps previously done by humans or robotic process automation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>

## Workflow Perspective: The Agentic Workflow
A workflow is the execution of a defined process, often involving sequential steps that can be commoditized or specialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Technology can be used for automation (substituting a step) or augmentation (doing a step quicker or better) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. While machine learning could achieve some of this before, [[the_impact_and_future_potential_of_ai_and_agents | AI agents]] introduce an "agentic workflow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

[[the_impact_and_future_potential_of_ai_and_agents | AI agents]] differ because they can:
1.  Tackle a broader set of tasks by operating on cognitive steps, often represented in natural language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
2.  Act as a "glue" between tasks, composing them together without human intervention, requiring human feedback only when necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

This enables the automation and delegation of multiple steps simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

**Key Takeaway:** To start building [[building_effective_ai_agents | agents]], organizations must first identify their workflows and understand the exact context around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. This context, including data, systems, transformations, and steps, is often unrecorded and exists only in employees' heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

## Network Perspective: Personas and Transformation
Relying solely on traditional roles and job titles is insufficient for applying [[the_impact_and_future_potential_of_ai_and_agents | AI agents]] because it doesn't convey the tools, planning, or behavioral conditions needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. A more helpful approach is the network perspective, where each contributor to a workflow is viewed as a "persona" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

Examples of personas include:
*   **Silent Achiever:** Low communication, high performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   **Individual Contributor:** Good communication and performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   **Connector:** Links non-adjacent teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
*   **Multiplier:** Enhances others' work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Knowledge Hub:** Provides domain expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

Defining personas helps project how [[the_impact_and_future_potential_of_ai_and_agents | AI agents]] might [[the_impact_and_future_potential_of_ai_and_agents | impact]] workflows and employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. For example, a silent achiever with a coding assistant might become so productive they can handle tasks previously requiring multiple people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. An [[the_impact_and_future_potential_of_ai_and_agents | AI agent]] could magnify a multiplier's impact across an entire team, or largely substitute a knowledge hub persona by dynamically supporting all team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. This leads to overall efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

**Key Takeaway:** Looking at personas is a helpful first step for organizations and people to adapt to AI, making it easier to project and plan for [[development_and_challenges_of_ai_agents | the development of different agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

## Emerging Patterns and New Roles
When considering how humans and [[the_impact_and_future_potential_of_ai_and_agents | AI agents]] can best perform tasks, ambiguous workflows or those requiring subjectivity are better suited for humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. Repetitive, tedious tasks or those requiring perfect, consistent execution are ideal for [[the_impact_and_future_potential_of_ai_and_agents | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.

Emerging patterns include:
*   **Commoditization of Intelligence and Domain Knowledge:** These become cheap and easily available, no longer a primary edge for employees or companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.
*   **Shift to Multi-disciplinary Know-how or Deeper Specialization:** Employees and companies must pivot to these areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.
*   **Context Understanding Gains Value:** In contrast to intelligence or domain expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.
*   **AI Supercharges Doers:** Individuals who perform and do can achieve significantly more (e.g., 100 times engineer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.
*   **Polarization in Positions:** Leading to new specializations and less middle ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>.

New roles might appear in AI-mature organizations, such as:
*   **Workflow Miner** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>
*   **Human-AI Orchestrator** (managing human-AI interaction) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>

## Enabling Organizational Adoption and Democratization
To democratize and adopt [[the_impact_and_future_potential_of_ai_and_agents | AI agents]], organizations can follow a step-by-step approach:
1.  **Access to General Assistants:** Providing basic access, which is likely already in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.
2.  **Individual Assistants:** Offering personalized assistants per employee with memory, context understanding, and personal databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>.
3.  **Employee-Built Agents:** Enabling employees to build agents quickly using no-code, low-code, or coding tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. This requires cognitive self-awareness to translate mental steps into explicit, buildable processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>.
4.  **Digital Twins:** Creating "time travelers" and memory to retain organizational knowledge, allowing an [[the_impact_and_future_potential_of_ai_and_agents | agent]] to represent an employee's experience and provide access to past expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.
5.  **Multi-Employee Agents:** Agents serving entire teams or workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>.
6.  **Swarm of Agents:** Advanced systems with multiple interacting [[the_impact_and_future_potential_of_ai_and_agents | agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.

This progression is now possible due to the maturing software stack around LLMs and [[the_impact_and_future_potential_of_ai_and_agents | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.

## [[challenges_and_benefits_of_ai_agents | Challenges and Opportunities]]

### [[challenges_and_benefits_of_ai_agents | Challenges]]
Common [[challenges_and_benefits_of_ai_agents | challenges]] include groundedness, hallucinations, guardrails, and security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>. Two critical [[challenges_and_benefits_of_ai_agents | challenges]] are:
*   **Adoption:** The social readiness for [[the_impact_and_future_potential_of_ai_and_agents | AI agents]] to drive interactions and delegate subtasks to humans, rather than just being delegated to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>.
*   **Ethics of Autonomy:** Defining explicit values for [[the_impact_and_future_potential_of_ai_and_agents | AI agents]] to uphold and resolving conflicts between human and [[the_impact_and_future_potential_of_ai_and_agents | AI agent]] decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>. As John Lennox stated, "the greater the machine's freedom, the more it will need a moral standards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>. This necessitates engaging with morality, ethics, and philosophy to operate technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>.

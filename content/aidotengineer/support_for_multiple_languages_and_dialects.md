Quen 3, the latest series of [[building_and_deploying_large_language_models | large language models]] developed by the Went team, significantly expands its support for various languages and dialects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

## Enhanced Language Coverage
Quen 3 supports over 119 languages and dialects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. This is a substantial improvement compared to its predecessor, Quen 2.5, which only supported 29 languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Detailed lists of supported languages and dialects are available for review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

## Impact and Benefits
This broad language support is designed to facilitate global applications of Quen models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Previously, many users, particularly those utilizing open web models, faced limitations due to insufficient language support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. The expanded support aims to empower more people to effectively use [[challenges_and_solutions_in_using_large_language_models | large language models]] in their respective domains and languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

This article summarizes insights from a survey of 100 [[the_evolution_and_current_state_of_ai_engineering|AI Engineers]] and discussions during a "Frontier Feud" event, highlighting current trends and considerations in AI engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Current Industry Perspectives

### Model Deployment and Architecture
There is a predicted trend towards the majority of deployed models being on-device within a year and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. This shift suggests a move towards smaller models that are orchestrated together and potentially hyperspecialized for specific tasks, rather than solely relying on larger cloud-based models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

One participant's "hot take" suggests that [[the_evolution_and_current_state_of_ai_engineering|Transformers]] may not be the final architecture, with a future possibility of models being built using biological materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

### Model Selection Considerations
When [[the_evolution_and_current_state_of_ai_engineering|AI engineers]] choose models, the top considerations identified by the survey are:
*   **Cost** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>
*   **Latency** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>
*   **Accuracy/Performance** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>
*   **Open Source vs. Closed Source** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>

### Workforce and Disruption
Predictions suggest a significant shift in the [[trends_and_shifts_in_ai_workforce_hiring|AI workforce]], with at least one of the leading five individuals currently training large models potentially no longer doing so by the end of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

Jobs perceived to be most at risk of AI disruption include:
*   Software Engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>
*   Content creation/Writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>
*   Data Entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>

### AI Tools and Preferences
Popular [[the_evolution_and_current_state_of_ai_engineering|AI tools]] favored by engineers include:
*   Cursor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>
*   Model APIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>

### [[buzzwords_in_ai|Buzzwords]] and Areas of Fatigue
[[the_evolution_and_current_state_of_ai_engineering|AI Engineers]] are reportedly tired of hearing the following [[buzzwords_in_ai|buzzwords]]:
*   [[the_emergence_and_significance_of_agent_engineering|Agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>
*   AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>
*   RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>
*   Prompt Engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>

### Challenges and Nightmares
The biggest nightmares for an [[role_of_ai_engineering_in_reliability|AI engineer]] at 2 AM include:
*   Hardware failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>
*   An outage of the model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>
*   Cuda errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>

## Future Directions for Software Architecture
It is suggested that the future of conversations will involve more than just one-on-one interactions with a bot, with most conversations potentially having at least two other bots present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This points to a trend of increased multi-agent interaction and orchestration. There's also an emphasis on human cognitive involvement, with a "tech hot take" suggesting that people should spend time with paper and pencil for "non-AI interrupted thoughts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, perhaps to generate better content for AI models that will eventually represent individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

An upcoming large-scale survey on the [[the_evolution_and_current_state_of_ai_engineering|state of AI engineering]] is planned to delve deeper into tools and workflows used by [[the_evolution_and_current_state_of_ai_engineering|AI Engineers]], aiming for greater industry transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>.

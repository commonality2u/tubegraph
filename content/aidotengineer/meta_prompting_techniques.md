[[Techniques and patterns in AI orchestration and prompt engineering | Prompt engineering]] is a nuanced process, and one effective strategy is **Meta Prompting** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## What is Meta Prompting?
Meta prompting involves using large language models (LLMs) themselves to assist in the prompt engineering process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. This means leveraging an LLM to:
*   Create prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>
*   Refine existing prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>
*   Improve the overall quality of prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>

It's essentially using an AI to help you build better AI interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

## Purpose and Benefits
The core idea behind meta prompting is that prompt engineering can be complex, and LLMs can provide assistance in this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

## Tools and Frameworks
Several frameworks and tools exist to facilitate meta prompting:
*   **Various Frameworks**: There are many frameworks available, some requiring "voting knowledge" and others not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **Free Tools**:
    *   Anthropic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>
    *   OpenAI's playground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>
    *   Prompt Hub: Offers a meta prompting tool that allows users to select their model provider (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic). It then runs a tailored meta prompt, recognizing that prompts optimized for one model might not be optimal for another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Prompt Hub also includes a co-pilot feature for iterating on prompts and providing feedback, built on principles similar to "Tech Grad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

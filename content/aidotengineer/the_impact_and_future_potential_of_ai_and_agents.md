The AI Engineer Summit has pivoted to focus on [[role_of_ai_agents_and_agentic_frameworks | agent engineering]], indicating a significant shift in the industry's direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. This strategic decision involves saying "no" to other areas like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), open models, and GPUs, to concentrate solely on the domain of agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. This focus is partly driven by the high engagement with "agentic" talks on YouTube from previous years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

## Defining an Agent

For any conference on agents, defining the term "agent" is a necessary public service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
From various perspectives:
*   **Machine Learning (ML)**: Agents are viewed in the context of reinforcement learning environments, focusing on actions to achieve goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   **Software Engineers**: May reductively define an agent as "a for loop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

Simon Willison, considered a "patron saint" in the AI engineering community, has crowdsourced over 300 definitions of what an agent is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Common themes among these definitions include:
*   Goal orientation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>
*   Tool use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>
*   Control flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>
*   Long-running processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>
*   Delegated authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>
*   Small, multi-step task completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>

OpenAI also introduced a new definition for agents, which is an important development to monitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

## Why Agents are Gaining Traction Now

The question arises: why are agents effective now, when they weren't a year or two ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>? Several factors contribute to their current viability:

*   **Improved Capabilities**: Models demonstrate better reasoning and tool use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. Capabilities have been steadily growing and are hitting human baselines around the present time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   **Model Diversity**: OpenAI's market share has decreased from approximately 95% two years ago to 50%, leading to a more diverse landscape of models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. The emergence of new Frontier Model Labs challenges OpenAI's dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   **Lower Cost of Intelligence**: The cost of GPT-4 level intelligence has decreased by 1,000 times in the last 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. Similar cost reductions are beginning for O1-level intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
*   **RL Fine-tuning Options**: The availability of reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning options is also a contributing factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
*   **Multi-agents and Faster Inference**: Advancements in multi-agent systems and faster inference capabilities, supported by improved hardware, are also playing a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

## Impact and [[future_opportunities_and_transformation_with_ai_agents | Future Potential]]

The saying "2025 is the year of Agents" is a common prediction by industry leaders like Satya Nadella, Roman, Greg Brockman, and Sam Altman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. While there has been skepticism and fatigue around the term "agents" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, OpenAI's shifting stance—from advising against "agents" in branding to now recommending it—signals a growing belief in their importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

### Agent Use Cases and Anti-Use Cases

Agent technology shows promise in specific areas:
*   **Product-Market Fit (PMF)**: Coding agents and support agents currently have PMF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. Deep research agents are also gaining PMF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
*   **Emerging Use Cases**: "Everything plus agent works," such as agent + RAG, agent + sentiment analysis, and agent + search, are seen as simple formulas for financial success in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

However, there are also "anti-use cases" for agents:
*   Booking flights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>
*   Booking Instacart orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>

### Growth Trajectory and Future of AI Engineering

OpenAI reported 400 million users, a 33% growth in three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. The growth of ChatGPT, particularly after a period of stagnation, is tightly linked to the shipment of agentic models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Agentic models have doubled ChatGPT's usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Projecting this trend, ChatGPT is expected to reach one billion users by the end of the current year, quintupling its user base from September of the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

The growth of any AI product is expected to be closely tied to its reasoning capabilities and the number of agents it can provide to users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. This massive scale suggests that by year-end, one-eighth of the world's population will be using ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

The job of an AI engineer is evolving towards building agents, similar to how Machine Learning Engineers build models and Software Engineers build software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. This highlights the transformative [[future_opportunities_and_transformation_with_ai_agents | potential]] and [[impact_of_ai_and_agents_on_infrastructure | impact]] of agents in the AI landscape.

Prepaid credits have become a widely adopted and common pricing model within the [[ai_agent_pricing_strategies | AI agent pricing]] space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. This model allows businesses to manage cash flow, mitigate risk, and offer flexible consumption options to their users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01:00">[16:01:00]</a>.

## Benefits of Prepaid Credits

Prepaid credits offer several advantages for companies pricing AI agents:

*   **Immediate Cash Flow**
    Prepaid models enable businesses to receive upfront payments, which is particularly beneficial for "cogs-heavy" (cost of goods sold) businesses that cannot absorb the risk of a pay-as-you-go credit model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05:00">[16:05:00]</a>.
*   **Fraud Counteraction**
    By requiring users to put money down upfront, prepaid credits can help counteract fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:22:00">[16:22:00]</a>.
*   **Easy Discounting Mechanism**
    Instead of having to discount every line item in complex pricing structures, companies can simply discount the conversion rate from credits to dollars. This simplifies the discounting process, especially when a company has multiple SKUs with varying unit rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:34:00">[16:34:00]</a>.
*   **Managing Fluctuating Demand**
    AI products often experience seasonal or fluctuating demand. A prepaid credit model allows customers to receive credits upfront and then burn them down over the course of a year, which is attractive to consumers and helps manage usage peaks and troughs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:00">[16:51:00]</a>.
*   **Generalization Across Use Cases**
    Prepaid credits are versatile, serving as a trial motion for small companies and a commitment motion for large, multi-million dollar deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:07:00">[17:07:00]</a>.

## Practical Implementation

Companies like Unify use credits within their tiered pricing structures, often alongside [[cost_management_in_ai_projects | usage limits]], caps, and seat-based pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. Clay, a go-to-market tool, also utilizes an upfront payment model consistent with prepaid credits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09:00">[16:09:00]</a>.

> [!info] Transparency in Credit Usage
> Providing customers with the ability to monitor their credit allotment and usage over time is crucial for transparency and helps users understand their spending on AI agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:51:00">[18:51:00]</a>. This also allows them to set spend caps and throttle use cases, giving them more control over their expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:46:00">[18:46:00]</a>.

Luma Labs exemplifies how a credit system can offer significant flexibility in pricing, alongside other levers such as platform choice (web/iOS), mode (relax mode), and rate limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:20:00">[15:20:00]</a>.

## Future Outlook

Looking ahead to 2025, while there's an expectation for a race to the bottom in pricing for some verticals due to increased competition and commoditization of inputs, there's also a trend towards offering effectively unlimited plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:51:00">[17:51:00]</a>. This might reduce the emphasis on granular credit management for some services, but the core benefits of prepaid models for cash flow and managing specific workloads are likely to remain relevant.

The [[Model context protocol MCP | Model Context Protocol (MCP)]] ecosystem, while exciting, faces several challenges for its users, particularly regarding fragmentation and installation friction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:04">[02:47:04]</a>. These are part of the broader [[Problems faced by MCP developers | problems faced by MCP developers]] and [[Challenges in the MCP ecosystem | challenges in the MCP ecosystem]] identified by Henry, CEO of Smithery and a member of the [[Model context protocol MCP | MCP]] steering committee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>.

## User Problems in the MCP Ecosystem
The [[Model context protocol MCP | MCP]] ecosystem, along with new services targeting AI agents, has introduced a range of new issues for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.

### Fragmentation
One significant issue is fragmentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:06">[02:48:06]</a>. An increasing number of [[Model context protocol MCP | MCP]] servers are being deployed daily, making it difficult for users to locate high-quality ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:08">[02:50:08]</a>. The [[Model context protocol MCP | MCP]] committee is actively addressing this by developing an official registry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:49">[02:56:49]</a>. However, merely having a registry does not fully resolve the problem; determining how to assign reputation to high-quality [[Model context protocol MCP | MCPs]] remains an open question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:05">[03:06:05]</a>.

### High Friction Installation
Another problem encountered by [[Model context protocol MCP | MCP]] users is the high friction associated with installation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:02">[03:14:02]</a>. Many [[Model context protocol MCP | MCP]] GitHub repositories feature a five-step installation process, which complicates setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:04">[03:16:04]</a>. Beyond the installation difficulty, there is also the risk of installing an insecure [[Model context protocol MCP | MCP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:21">[03:25:21]</a>.

AI simulation offers a revolutionary approach to design, enabling teams to accelerate need finding and create "invisible interfaces" that are seamless and intuitive for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This method seeks to address the current "AI trust gap" by delivering better user experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## The Current State of AI in UX: A Trust Gap

Recent research from December 2024 by Edelman highlights a significant "AI trust gap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>:
*   Only 32% of US adults trust [[AI in enterprise applications | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   Only 44% of adults globally feel comfortable with how businesses use [[AI in enterprise applications | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

This trust gap is often attributed to "AI slop," where [[AI in enterprise applications | generative AI]] (GenAI) fails by providing incorrect information or non-sensical outputs, such as a search result suggesting eating rocks daily or a website offering a car for $1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. While some website creators are "stuffing [[AI in enterprise applications | AI]] chatbots" everywhere and calling it "magic," the true magic of GenAI lies in its ability to allow users to interact with machine learning models using natural language—a significant [[AI technological advancements | UX revolution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## The Opportunity: Invisible Interfaces Through AI

Inspired by Don Norman's concept of "invisible interfaces" from *The Invisible Computer*—software so seamless users forget they are using it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>—the opportunity is to use [[AI in workflow automation and augmentation | AI]] to design interfaces that genuinely feel like magic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. This is achieved not by superficial chatbot integration, but by accelerating the "need finding" process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

### The New Design Life Cycle with [[AI simulation in design | AI Simulation]]

Traditional design processes, pre-ChatGPT, are data-driven, relying on qualitative observations, quantitative data, and ethnographic studies to guide prototyping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The proposed new approach for design in an [[AI in workflow automation and augmentation | AI]] era draws parallels to pilot training in a complex cockpit environment, which heavily utilizes simulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

The goal is to empower designers to work with "invisible users" in the form of [[AI simulation in design | AI simulation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. This turns data artifacts from need finding into active participants in the design process, providing designers with a mini feedback cycle to enhance design outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

### Accelerated Need Finding Process in the [[AI simulation in design | AI Simulation]] Era

The new process for need finding retains core similarities with existing methods but introduces key differences in components and workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>:

1.  **Define Audience**: Start with robust data representing target audiences, including demographic, psychographic, and contextual information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. Huge, for instance, uses its "Live" data platform for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
2.  **Intent Mapping**: Transform this data into "intelligent twins"—active simulations representing user behaviors, desired outcomes, needs, and motivations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. These intelligent twins become active participants in the design simulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
3.  **Identify Specific Tasks**: Brief intelligent twins to evaluate interfaces by focusing on specific tasks, similar to how a human designer might conduct a heuristic analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
4.  **Conduct Analysis**: Leverage the scale and speed of intelligent twins to perform audits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
5.  **Refine Insights**: Roll up high-level insights or dive into granular details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
6.  **Develop Design Alternatives**: Generate focused design briefs for human teams based on [[AI simulation in design | AI acceleration]], computer vision models, and human-in-the-loop observation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

## Example Project: Global Sports Website Audit

To illustrate the methodology, a sample project audited global sports websites from the perspective of a business seeking to partner with sports leagues worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

*   **Audiences**: Two personas were defined: a "casual fan" new to the sport and a "super fan" who is lifelong and savvy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
*   **Tasks**: Across three different sports websites (basketball, Olympics, English Premier League), a series of tasks were briefed for navigation, information architecture, and fan engagement categories, with four tasks per category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   **Simulation**: This allowed for the simulation of 72 [[AI simulation in design | AI simulated actions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

**Findings**:
*   All audited sites performed well in navigation tasks (the starting place for a fan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   However, success rates dropped significantly as fans delved deeper into content browsing, information architecture, and engagement pathways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

This audit highlights user pain points, demonstrating how the methodology can help understand and solve them, thereby helping to repair the "AI trust gap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. The methodology's ability to operate at different levels of altitude (broad or deep) allows for the creation of focused design briefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

## Future Considerations and Limitations

As [[AI technological advancements | AI tools]] accelerate, it will become easier to create new designs, emphasizing the importance of focusing on the "why" (strategy and problem-solving for users) rather than just the "how" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. For example, the MCP protocol from Anthropic is already showing potential for turning prototype components in Figma into actual code components in React or Node.js <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

This methodology is still experimental and in early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. Key areas for improvement include:
*   **Reproducibility**: Standardizing parameters like briefing instructions, simulated audience dimensions, number of audit runs, and task completion/failure parameters in a code repository <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **Test and Control Methodology**: Applying a test and control approach to isolate the strengths of [[AI simulation in design | intelligent twins]] for design need finding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. This will help understand how [[AI simulation in design | intelligent twins]] can be used alongside or complementary to human teams across different industries, geographies, and domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

## Conclusion

To repair the current "AI trust gap," the focus should shift from poorly implemented [[AI in enterprise applications | GenAI]] chatbots to creating better websites, mobile apps, and interfaces that offer clarity and simplicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. [[AI simulation in design | AI simulation]] is a powerful tool to empower design teams, enabling them to gather insights smarter, faster, and better, ultimately leading to interfaces that restore user trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

The advent of AI and agents is profoundly [[the_impact_and_future_potential_of_ai_and_agents | redefining how companies build teams]], design workflows, and, crucially, what roles they hire for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. This shift is compared to transformations seen during the industrial revolution and the automobile age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

## Reshaping Organizational Structure and Roles

In an AI-native or agent-native company, AI is not merely an add-on but is central to how work gets done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This fundamental integration leads to significant changes in organizational design and individual roles:

*   **Humans as Conductors**: Employees transition from being "cogs in a machine" to "conductors" orchestrating AI agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. This implies a new focus on higher-level navigation and strategy, while routine and mundane tasks are offloaded to AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
*   **Flatter, Leaner Structures**: The need for middle management layers shrinks as intelligent systems handle much of the coordination and execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. The organizational chart is expected to look less like a pyramid and more like a network of humans and AI working together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
*   **New Titles and Hybrid Roles**: Future job titles are likely to combine domain expertise with AI know-how, such as "AI Engineer" or "AI Customer Lead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. This [[impact_of_ai_on_organizational_structure_and_roles | shift impacts organizational structure and roles]] across all departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.
*   **Agent Managers**: The emergence of roles like "agent manager," a manager specifically tasked with managing AI workers, is already occurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. This means managing agents can become someone's full-time job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Evolving Hiring Criteria

The shift to an AI-native model necessitates a rethinking of the entire hiring process and the attributes desired in candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.

*   **AI Fluency as a Must-Have**: Just as word processor proficiency became standard for office jobs, AI fluency is becoming a mandatory skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. Companies will actively seek candidates proficient in guiding AI agents to perform tasks and leverage their expertise through these agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.
*   **Emphasis on Curiosity and Adaptability**: These qualities are increasingly in high demand for creative and leadership roles, and for an agent-native company, they are considered essential for new hires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.
*   **Skepticism Towards AI Inexperience**: Recruiters may become skeptical of candidates unfamiliar with AI, viewing it as a "warning flag" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.
*   **Leadership Hiring Focus**: When hiring VPs or other leaders, the spotlight will be on their ability to utilize AI agents and bring in other team members who possess AI fluency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] The PWC report states: "If you're only using AI for a small efficiency gain, then you're falling behind because there's companies that they're not just using it for a small efficiency gain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>. This applies to hiring as well, as merely tweaking existing processes won't suffice.

## Changes in Onboarding and Support

The onboarding process itself will transform to align with the agent-native model:

*   **Agent Setup Focus**: New hires are expected to spend their initial weeks primarily setting up their AI agents to perform their job functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.
*   **Dedicated Engineering Support**: It may become standard practice to attach an engineer to a team to ensure their agents are properly set up and running effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.

This [[trends_and_shifts_in_ai_workforce_hiring | profound shift in the AI workforce hiring]] means companies must step back and rethink their entire structure, culture, and processes from first principles to embrace a future where human-to-agent teams can scale impact exponentially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>.

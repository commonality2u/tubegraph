## Tech Hot Takes on the Future of AI

Participants shared their insights into the future of [[advancements_in_ai_and_future_implications | AI technology]]:

*   **Market Consolidation in Model Training**: One prediction suggested that out of the current "fiveish people training big models today," at least one will no longer be doing so by the end of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   **[[applications_and_future_of_ai_technology | AI]] as Therapists**: [[advancements_in_ai_and_future_implications | AIs]] are believed to make very good therapists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   **Importance of Human Thought**: Engineers in the [[ai_industry_trends_and_challenges | AI industry]] should dedicate time to "non-[[applications_and_future_of_ai_technology | AI]] interrupted thoughts" to ensure good content for future [[applications_and_future_of_ai_technology | AI models]] that represent users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **On-Device Models and Specialization**: Within a year and a half, the majority of deployed [[advancements_in_ai_model_technology_and_performance | AI models]] are predicted to be on-device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. This trend favors smaller, orchestrated models that are hyperspecialized for specific tasks, rather than solely relying on larger models requiring external data transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **[[applications_and_future_of_ai_technology | AI]] in Dating**: A futuristic view suggested that dating apps will evolve to have [[applications_and_future_of_ai_technology | AIs]] dating each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **Beyond Transformers**: The Transformer architecture may not be the final design for [[advancements_in_ai_model_technology_and_performance | AI models]], with the eventual development of models using biological materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
*   **Multi-Bot Conversations**: Future conversations are expected to involve at least two other bots in the room, moving beyond one-on-one interactions with a single bot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

## State of AI Engineering Survey

A massive survey on the state of [[the_future_of_ai_engineering | AI engineering]] is currently underway, aiming to provide deeper insights into the tools and workflows used by [[evolution_of_ai_engineering_and_tools | AI Engineers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>. The results will be presented at the June [[the_future_of_ai_engineering | AI Engineer]] World Fair, promoting industry transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>.

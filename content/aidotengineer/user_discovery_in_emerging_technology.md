Munir, CEO and co-founder of Porsche AI, shares insights from his journey of transitioning from big tech companies like Stripe, Google, and Amazon to founding an [[transition_from_big_tech_to_ai_startup | AI startup]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. His experience is particularly useful for individuals looking to start their own companies in the current [[AI Engineering Trends | AI]] space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Porsche AI, founded in June of the previous year with co-founder Emma, is an open-source SDK for building production agents with a focus on regulated industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## User Problems and User Discovery in AI

User problem definition and discovery in the current [[AI Engineering Trends | AI]] landscape feel significantly different from traditional product roles in big tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

### The "Soulslike Game" Analogy
In conventional product development, user problems typically have a discernible shape and adjacency to familiar issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. For example, a user at Stripe wanting card issuance for their balance is a problem anchored in existing payment products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. However, in an [[AI Engineering Trends | AI]] startup, especially when building from scratch, it feels like playing a "Soulslike game" for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Users don't necessarily know what their problems are; instead, they sort of know they want to use [[AI Engineering Trends | AI]] and recognize an opportunity, but the specific user problems emerge as a property of the space itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. The rapid pace of technological change further complicates this, as what is possible with [[AI Engineering Trends | AI]] is constantly evolving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

Instead of conventional three-to-six-month roadmaps, companies must make directional bets and rapidly iterate on them by releasing products and observing user reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. The primary anchor for the team becomes a hypothesis-driven, deliberate iteration process, providing necessary focus in a rapidly changing environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

### The "No Man's Sky" Analogy
Traditional user storyboards and critical user journey definitions become largely irrelevant in this context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. This environment is akin to starting "No Man's Sky," where there's no clear story arc or mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. Instead, the product team must create their own narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

A crucial aspect of [[AI Accelerated Need Finding Process | AI Accelerated Need Finding Process]] is helping users overcome their initial inertia when trying [[AI Engineering Trends | AI]] for specific use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. This involves working collaboratively with users to create these narratives and help them anchor on a specific use case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. Once a use case is established, it becomes more familiar territory, allowing for iteration and refinement of the product against defined problems and challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. This stage is like "colonizing the planet in No Man's Sky," where actual problems become clearer and the problem space is more scoped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

### Rapid Product Development in AI
The product development process in [[AI Engineering Trends | AI]] is highly gratifying due to its speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Unlike the lengthy sign-off processes in big tech, an [[AI Engineering Trends | AI]] startup can go from an idea to a released product (including spec, design, testing) within hours or a few days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

However, velocity is a fundamental requirement, not a bonus, in [[AI Engineering Trends | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. Opportunities that allow products to stand out, like new standards (e.g., MCP), agent-to-agent protocols, or diffusion models, emerge and disappear rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Being able to react quickly and build products at the forefront of these technological breakthroughs is essential for brand growth and cementing presence in the developer or user community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

### Challenges in Outreach and Awareness
Gaining outreach, awareness, traffic, and adoption presents a significant challenge for new [[AI Engineering Trends | AI]] startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. In the current [[AI Engineering Trends | AI]] space, which is characterized by hype and "meme wars," it's difficult to distinguish signal from noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. Without the brand advantages of a larger company, it feels like playing Crash Bandicoot or Mario Kart without any boosters or power-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

Key learnings for gaining visibility include:
*   **People follow people:** Unlike big tech, where a tweet from a founder can launch a product, startups need to find credible advocates and industry voices to act as force multipliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   **Finding allies:** To compensate for the lack of brand association and established channels, startups should find allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. These can be other startups at a similar stage or slightly ahead, interested in synergistic partnerships for cross-marketing and cross-selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Getting a product listed in the integration documentation of a larger company (like Browserbase) can also serve as a significant channel for driving traffic to a website or GitHub repository <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

This area has been a steep learning curve and a massive challenge, but also a significant source of learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

Outcome-based pricing, also known as success-based pricing, is an [[ai_agent_pricing_strategies | AI agent pricing strategy]] where customers pay based on the successful results or outcomes delivered by the AI agent, rather than traditional metrics like usage volume or time. This model demonstrates a company's confidence in its product's ability to deliver value and aligns pricing with the customer's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.

## Characteristics

*   **Payment for Success:** Customers only pay when a desired outcome is achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.
*   **ROI Guarantee:** This model often effectively provides an ROI (Return on Investment) guarantee for the tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.
*   **Confidence Indication:** It signals the provider's high confidence in their product's performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.

## Examples in Practice

### Intercom's Finn

Intercom, a successful company, has adopted [[ai_agent_pricing_strategies | outcome-based pricing]] for its AI agent, Finn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. While offering traditional tiered models (Essential, Advanced, Expert), Finn also includes a 99-cent cost per resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. This means customers pay specifically for each successful resolution of customer support tickets that Finn handles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.

### Chargeflow

Chargeflow, a chargeback recovery tool, exemplifies [[ai_agent_pricing_strategies | outcome-based pricing]] by charging a percentage per recovered chargeback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. Customers do not pay anything unless a chargeback recovery is successful, providing a clear ROI guarantee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

## Future Trends

In [[future_trends_in_ai_agent_pricing | 2025]], there is an expectation for a continued lean into outcome or success-based pricing models for AI agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:16:00">[18:16:00]</a>. This will necessitate clearer discussions around defining success and establishing robust guarantees and service level agreements (SLAs) from providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:20:00">[18:20:00]</a>.

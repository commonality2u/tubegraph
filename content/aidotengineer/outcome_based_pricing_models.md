Outcome-based pricing models are a strategy where customers pay for a product or service based on the measurable results or successes it achieves for them, rather than on usage, features, or time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. This approach demonstrates confidence in the product's effectiveness and aligns pricing with the value delivered to the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.

## Examples in Practice

### Intercom Finn
Intercom's AI agent, Finn, utilizes an outcome-based pricing model. While they offer a traditional tiered model (Essential, Advanced, Expert), a key component of their [[ai_agent_pricing_strategies | AI agent pricing strategies]] is a $0.99 cost per resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. This means customers only pay when Finn successfully resolves a customer support ticket, aligning payment directly with the agent's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.

### Chargeflow
Chargeflow, a chargeback recovery tool, charges a percentage per recovered chargeback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. This is a clear example of outcome-based pricing, as users pay nothing unless a chargeback recovery is successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. This model provides an effective ROI guarantee on their tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.

## Future Trends

It is expected that [[future_trends_in_ai_agent_pricing | future trends in AI agent pricing]] will increasingly lean into outcome or success-based pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:16:00">[18:16:00]</a>. However, this shift will require greater clarity on guarantees and Service Level Agreements (SLAs) provided by vendors, leading to more discussions around clear definitions of "success" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:20:00">[18:20:00]</a>. This will also involve more investment in monetization R&D to provide customers with greater control and visibility over their usage and spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:35:00">[18:35:00]</a>.

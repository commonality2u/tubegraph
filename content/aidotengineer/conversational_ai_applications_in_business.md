Sierra is a [[voice_ai_and_its_applications_in_enhancing_customer_experience | conversational AI platform]] designed for businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. While often associated with chat experiences and customer service, Sierra is expanding its reach to include a broader range of customer interactions and touch points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. By the end of the year, most of its interactions are expected to be over the phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

Current applications for Sierra's platform include:
*   Sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>
*   Subscription management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>
*   Product recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>
*   Various other aspects of the customer experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>

## The Evolution of AI and Iterative Improvement

Reflecting on the history of AI, significant advancements have been made in a relatively short period, often within the last decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. As far back as 2016, AI was in its "caves," with researchers at Google working on problems like distinguishing between Chihuahuas and blueberry muffins for what would become Google Lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

Google Lens, initially capable of identifying plants, has evolved significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Today, it allows users to:
*   Search and shop what they see <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>
*   Translate non-Latin character sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>
*   Help with math homework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>
*   Still identify flowers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>

This evolution highlights the importance of consistent, step-by-step iteration over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Just as software development relies on a life cycle for continuous improvement, so too must AI development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## Case Study: Chubbies and Duncan Smothers

[[case_studies_and_practical_examples_of_ai_implementation | Chubbies]], a clothing company, partnered with Sierra to implement an [[ai_agents_beyond_chatbots | AI agent]] named Duncan Smothers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Chubbies recognized that in 2025, just as businesses needed websites and mobile apps previously, they now require an [[developing_ai_agents_for_productivity | AI agent]] to represent their business and assist customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

Duncan Smothers is designed to be both highly capable and engaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Examples of Duncan's capabilities include:
*   **Sizing and Fit:** Providing empathetic assistance and product recommendations based on customer measurements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   **Inventory Tracking:** Informing customers about product availability and suggesting alternative items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   **Package Tracking and Refunds:** Providing multiple tracking numbers for orders and initiating refunds autonomously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

The results for Chubbies include helping more customers more quickly and with higher satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. This demonstrates the potential of [[ai_in_enterprise_and_startups | AI in enterprise]] to take autonomous actions beyond merely answering questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

## The Agent Development Life Cycle (ADLC)

Sierra treats every AI agent as a product, requiring a fully featured developer and customer experience operations platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. This approach involves dedicated agent engineering and product management teams working closely with customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

The challenge with large language models (LLMs) is that they are non-deterministic, slow, expensive, and creative, unlike traditional software which is deterministic, fast, cheap, and rigid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. The Agent Development Life Cycle (ADLC) at Sierra is a methodology designed to leverage the strengths of LLMs while integrating traditional software where beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

### Quality Assurance in ADLC
A key component of the ADLC is Quality Assurance (QA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. Customers have access to Sierra's Experience Manager, allowing them to:
*   Review every conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>
*   View high-level performance reports in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>
*   Provide feedback on agent performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>

When an issue is reported (e.g., incorrect inventory information), it leads to an issue being filed, a test being created, and ultimately a new release once the test passes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. Over time, Sierra agents grow from having a handful of tests at launch to hundreds and thousands as they improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. This feedback loop is essential for [[evaluation_metrics_for_ai_conversational_systems | continuously improving AI conversational systems]].

The ADLC also identifies opportunities for agents to go "above and beyond," such as an agent having a budget to delight customers by arranging direct delivery of items not available online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. Initially, this process was manual, but with advancements in AI, AI is now being integrated into each stage of the life cycle to speed up improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

## Voice AI and Responsive Agent Design

Sierra launched general availability for its [[voice_ai_and_its_applications_in_enhancing_customer_experience | Voice AI and its applications in enhancing customer experience]] capabilities in October <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. For large customers like SiriusXM, this allows them to answer customer calls immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

Sierra's approach to voice is similar to responsive web design:
*   Under the hood, it's the same platform and agent code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.
*   The agent is responsive to the channel (e.g., chat, phone) and modality (e.g., text, voice) through which a customer reaches out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>.
*   Customization is possible for phrasing or parallelizing requests to achieve lower latency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>.

## Empathy in AI Design

A fascinating aspect of building with AI is that large language models can remind us of ourselves: they can be unpredictable, slow, and not great at math <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. However, this also allows designers to approach AI development with a new form of empathy, putting themselves in the "shoes of the robot" or the "primordial soup of the Jell-O" to create better experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.

When considering multimodal agents (like those combining text and voice), a key design question is how an agent would perform if it only received transcribed text with a few hundred milliseconds of delay and had to respond instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. Sierra aims to build robust systems that allow LLMs to have the same inputs and experiences as humans, leading to richer and more effective AI applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.

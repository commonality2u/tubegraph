Munir, CEO and co-founder of Porsche AI, shares insights from his journey as a recent AI startup founder, transitioning from product roles at large technology companies like Stripe, Google, and Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This presentation aims to be particularly useful for those considering starting their own company or those in a similar stage in the AI space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## User Problem Discovery in AI

Munir notes a significant difference in user problem discovery and defining user problems in AI startups compared to his previous experiences in big tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

### Uncharted Territory

Traditionally, user problems often have a discernible shape and adjacency to familiar issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. For example, at Stripe, a user's need for card issuance related to their Stripe balance had a clear anchor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. However, in an AI startup, it feels akin to playing a "Soulslike" game for the first time, where understanding how to combine elements (like gear in a game) is initially unclear, even if the general goal (like increasing stats) is known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

### Emergent Problems

Users in the AI space often don't fully articulate their problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. They recognize a desire to use AI and see potential opportunities, but the actual user problems are often an emergent property of the space, yet to be defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. This is complicated by the rapid evolution of technology and what's possible with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### Dynamic Roadmaps and Iteration

Unlike conventional three-to-six-month roadmaps, AI development necessitates making directional bets and iterating very rapidly by launching products and observing user reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. The team's focus and anchor become hypothesis-driven, deliberate iteration, rather than traditional roadmaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

### Building New Narratives

Established practices like user storyboards and critical user journeys often become less relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Munir likens this to playing *No Man's Sky*, where players initially lack a clear story arc or mission and must create their own narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

Instead, AI startups must:
*   Help users overcome the initial inertia of adopting AI for specific use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
*   Collaborate with users to establish these narratives and anchor on a particular use case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   Once a use case is identified, the process moves towards more familiar territory, where the product can be refined against that specific use case and its associated challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. This is like "colonizing a planet" in *No Man's Sky*, leading to more tangible and scoped problem spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

This dual aspect presents both an opportunity and a [[challenges_of_starting_an_ai_company | challenge]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

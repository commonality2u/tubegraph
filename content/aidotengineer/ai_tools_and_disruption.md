## Industry Benefiting Most from AI

The industry expected to benefit most from [[ai_in_enterprise_applications | AI]] is Healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.

## Hot Takes on AI Development and Trends

Various "tech hot takes" shared during the event provide a glimpse into future [[evolution_of_ai_engineering_and_tools | AI engineering]] and trends:

*   **Future of Model Training**: It's predicted that at least one of the current major players training large models today will no longer be doing so by the end of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   **[[ai_in_workflow_automation_and_augmentation | AI]] as Therapists**: [[ai_technological_advancements | AI]] are suggested to make really good therapists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   **Non-[[ai_in_workflow_automation_and_augmentation | AI]] Interrupted Thinking**: Professionals in the [[ai_technological_advancements | AI]] industry should dedicate 20 minutes daily to paper-and-pencil thinking, uninterrupted by [[ai_technological_advancements | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This is considered important for providing good content for [[ai_technological_advancements | AI]] models to be trained on, especially when [[ai_technological_advancements | AI]] models represent individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **On-Device Models and Smaller Models**: A significant trend towards the majority of deployed models being on-device within a year and a half, with smaller, hyperspecialized models orchestrated together, rather than solely relying on larger models and external data processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **[[ai_in_enterprise_applications | AI]] Dating [[ai_in_enterprise_applications | AI]]**: In the future, dating apps might feature [[ai_technological_advancements | AI]]s dating each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **Beyond Transformers**: Transformers are not seen as the final [[scaling_ai_models_and_their_impact_on_development_tools | AI architecture]], with eventual models being built using biological materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
*   **Multi-[[ai_agents_in_devops | Bot]] Conversations**: One-on-one chatting with an [[ai_agents_in_devops | AI bot]] is considered boring, suggesting that future conversations will involve at least two other [[ai_agents_in_devops | bots]] in the room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   **"Token Wall"**: The idea of hitting a "token wall" in [[ai_technological_advancements | AI]] development is dismissed as a "skill issue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

## Future of AI Engineering

An upcoming "State of [[evolution_of_ai_engineering_and_tools | AI Engineering]]" survey is being conducted to provide greater transparency in the industry regarding tools and workflows used by [[challenges_and_innovations_in_ai_engineering | AI Engineers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>.

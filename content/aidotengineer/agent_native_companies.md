An "agent native" or [[ai_enhanced_vs_ai_native_businesses|AI native company]] is a business model where AI is central to how work gets done, rather than just an add-on or a tool used for specific tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. This approach redefines team building, workflow design, and even hiring roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>.

Imagine a workday where instead of checking email, you review the status of tasks completed by your AI agent co-workers overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. These agents pull you into things that require your attention, have been completed, or need approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. At Agentuity, the startup presenting this concept, it's common to suggest having an agent like "Devon" handle tasks, which often results in a pull request ready for review by the end of a stand-up meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. This shift is so profound that a startup recently posted a job opening for an "agent manager" – a manager specifically for AI workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.

## [[ai_enhanced_vs_ai_native_businesses|AI Enhanced vs. AI Native Businesses]]

The distinction between an [[ai_enhanced_vs_ai_native_businesses|AI enhanced business]] and an [[ai_enhanced_vs_ai_native_businesses|AI native business]] is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>:

*   **AI Enhanced Business**: Uses AI sporadically, perhaps for efficiency gains, but would still function without it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>. This is likened to a car with driver assist features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>.
*   **AI Native (Agent Native) Business**: Built from the ground up with [[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents|AI agents]] at its core, augmenting human productivity and intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. AI is embedded in the foundation of the product, operations, and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. It's the engine driving the company forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.

If you remove agents from an agent native company, employees would be significantly less productive, bogged down by mundane and unfulfilling tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. For example, at Agentuity, an agent handles change logs and documentation, a task engineers would find undesirable if removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>. Without AI, such companies would move slower, incur higher costs, and their products would feel outdated and less useful compared to competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. In an agent native business, every employee focuses on higher-level strategic navigation and company success, while routine tasks and micro-decisions are offloaded to agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.

## What Makes a Company Agent Native?

While still in early stages, several defining attributes characterize an agent native company:

### AI at the Center of Everything
AI is not confined to one team, feature, or aspect of culture; it's ubiquitous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>. Departments like product, customer support, and operations are expected to have agents performing routine and key daily work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>. These departments utilize agent interfaces and handoffs, integrating seamlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>. Removing agents would lead to a "human scramble" and a significant loss of productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>.

### Humans as Conductors
In an [[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents|AI native company]], people transition from being cogs in a machine to conductors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>. This shift necessitates a different hiring profile and a flatter, leaner organizational chart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>. Middle management layers shrink because intelligent systems handle much of the coordination and execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>. For instance, detailed product requirements can be created, and agents can begin building and drafting messaging and documentation within a day of a deep-dive discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>. This culture encourages rapid prototyping, where agents facilitate more iterations and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>. The org chart resembles a network of humans and AI working together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>.

### Experimentation and Iterative Culture
While common in tech startups, this principle reaches its full potential in an [[ai_enhanced_vs_ai_native_businesses|AI native company]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>. With AI handling routine work and assisting with prototypes, humans can truly focus on critical matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>. Agents working within the company can continuously learn and improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>. For example, using Cognition's Dev'in, an agent can learn and document code over time, becoming a significant "superpower" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>.

These attributes—AI at the core, humans as orchestrators, rapid experimentation, and self-learning agent evolution—create an organization fundamentally different from traditional companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>.

## The Typical Agent Native Workday

A significant new aspect of the typical workday in an agent native company is overseeing what AI agents are doing or have done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>. A common routine might involve:
*   **Morning**: Starting the day by reviewing a log of tasks, often leveraging AI chatbots (like GPT-3 or deep research tools) during a walk or drive to kick off bigger thinking or product ideas, providing documents, links, or conversation transcripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>. Agents like "Devon" might already be generating pull requests for bugs or documentation issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>.
*   **Mid-day**: By lunchtime, reviewing numerous pull requests, collateral, and emails generated by agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:00">[12:34:00]</a>.

Every employee can become a "lead manager" type, not necessarily managing people, but managing their [[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents|AI agent]] counterparts responsible for their job functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:00">[12:46:00]</a>. This includes orchestrating content marketing agent swarms to optimize copy and schedule social media posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>. This approach leverages human expertise with asynchronous agent workloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:00">[13:19:00]</a>.

This leads to flatter team structures and new titles that combine domain expertise with AI know-how, such as "AI Engineer" or "AI Customer Lead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:28:00">[13:28:00]</a>.

## Rethinking Hiring

The hiring process and the type of talent sought change significantly for an agent native company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:00">[14:03:00]</a>.
*   **AI Fluency is a Must-Have**: Just as keyboard proficiency is expected for an office job, AI fluency becomes a fundamental requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:00">[14:41:00]</a>. Companies will actively assess a candidate's ability to guide [[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents|AI agents]], learn tips and tricks, and utilize their expertise through agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26:00">[15:26:00]</a>. Skepticism arises if candidates are unfamiliar with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53:00">[15:53:00]</a>.
*   **Changed Hiring Criteria**: When hiring for senior roles like a VP, the focus shifts from just their human network to their ability to use agents and bring in people who also possess AI fluency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:25:00">[16:25:00]</a>.
*   **Different Onboarding**: The onboarding process is also rethought. New hires might spend their first few weeks solely focused on setting up their agents to perform their job effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:27:00">[17:27:00]</a>. It may even become standard to attach an engineer to a new team to ensure their agents are operational and built out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:19:00">[17:19:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

The rise of agent native companies represents a profound shift, akin to the industrial revolution or the advent of the automobile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:42:00">[17:42:00]</a>. [[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents|AI agents]] are becoming deeply embedded in every business aspect, requiring a re-evaluation of roles, skills, culture, and operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:06:00">[18:06:00]</a>. This is not merely about businesses using AI as a tool, but about businesses being built *around* AI as a core primitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:22:00">[18:22:00]</a>.

The transition from "driver-assisted" to "AI-automated" business models presents immense opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:31:00">[18:31:00]</a>. For example, a small team of six or seven people at Agentuity built an entire agent cloud infrastructure from scratch in just a few weeks, a feat previously considered impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:48:00">[18:48:00]</a>.

For founders and tech leaders, the challenge is to fully embrace this paradigm shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:21:00">[19:21:00]</a>. This may mean setting aside years of traditional experience and adopting a first-principles approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:30:00">[19:30:00]</a>. As a PWC report noted, merely using AI for small efficiency gains means falling behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:55:00">[19:55:00]</a>. The admonition is to step back, reimagine, and refit companies and cultures for this future, rewiring processes so that human-to-agent teams can scale impact exponentially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:12:00">[20:12:00]</a>. This includes redesigning org charts, redefining roles, and rethinking hiring skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:35:00">[20:35:00]</a>. This significant change, while potentially painful, can provide an "unfair advantage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:43:00">[20:43:00]</a>.

The ultimate question for companies is: Is your company merely *using* AI, or is it ready to be *built around* AI? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:50:00">[20:50:00]</a>

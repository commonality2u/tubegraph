The Alma score is a concept developed to provide users with a sense of how holistically well they are eating, beyond just calories and macros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:14">[02:14:14]</a>.

## Purpose and Development
Alma realized through [[human_reviews_of_ai_outputs | user feedback]] that individuals wanted to understand the quality of their food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:40">[02:21:40]</a>. This was due to the understanding that "1,000 calories could be had a million different ways," and not all of it is equal in terms of quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.

The Alma score concept was developed with the academic adviser at Harvard University, Dr. Eric Prim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:52">[02:30:52]</a>.

## Functionality
The Alma score is designed to be a simple score out of 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:53">[02:38:53]</a>. Its purpose is to easily steer users throughout the day towards consuming more foods that are fundamentally good for their health, based on decades of scientific research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:43">[02:41:43]</a>. Conversely, it aims to nudge users away from items known to be less beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:17">[02:51:17]</a>.

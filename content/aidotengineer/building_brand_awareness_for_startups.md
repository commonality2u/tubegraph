Munir, CEO and co-founder of Porsche AI, shares insights from his journey transitioning from product roles at big tech companies like Stripe, Google, and Amazon to founding an [[AI in enterprise and startups | AI startup]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. His experience is particularly relevant for those considering or currently engaged in a [[transition_from_big_tech_to_ai_startup | transition from big tech to AI startup]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Challenges of Building Awareness from Scratch

Building outreach, awareness, traffic, and adoption for a new startup from scratch is one of the toughest and most underestimated challenges for founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Unlike big tech companies that benefit from established brand recognition and internal support structures, startups have minimal "scaffolding" around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. In the current AI space, which is characterized by intense hype and "meme wars," it's difficult to distinguish signal from noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

Munir describes this challenge using video game analogies:
*   It's like playing *Crash Bandicoot* without any boosters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   Or, playing *Mario Kart* without the ability to fire red or green shells at competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

This area has presented the steepest learning curve for Munir and Porsche AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

## Strategies for Brand and Product Awareness

### Leveraging Credible Voices
Unlike launching a product at a company like Stripe, where a simple tweet from leadership can generate instant awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>, startups must actively seek out advocates. It is crucial to find credible voices within the industry who can speak on behalf of the startup and use their platforms as "force multipliers" to spread awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

### Strategic Partnerships and Cross-Marketing
Without the inherent advantages of a large brand's website or existing marketing channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>, startups should find allies. These allies can include:
*   Other startups at a similar stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   Slightly more established startups that see synergy and are interested in the same space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

Finding ways to partner, cross-market, and cross-sell is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. Even seemingly small achievements, such as getting a product listed in the integration documentation of another company (e.g., Browserbase), can serve as a significant channel to direct users to the startup's website or GitHub repository for product discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

Despite the challenges, Munir emphasizes that this difficult learning curve is part of the journey and a significant opportunity for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

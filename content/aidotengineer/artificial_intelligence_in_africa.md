Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the world, extending its influence beyond tech circles to wider conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. For Africans, this transformation specifically applies to the continent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Evolution of AI

AI is not a new concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>:
*   **Neural Networks**: Concepts fundamental to AI, like neural networks, emerged around 1950 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Machine Learning**: This concept appeared in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Deep Learning**: More recent discussions have focused on deep learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   **Agentic AI**: The conversation has shifted from generative AI to agentic AI, which focuses on the decisions AI can make <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Africa's Position in the AI Landscape

While Africa is often perceived as nascent in the AI phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>, its people are deeply immersed in technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Kenya, for instance, ranks as the third-highest daily user of ChatGPT globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. Despite this, Africa is often underrepresented in global discussions about new AI startups and patents, frequently positioned below other continents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

This perceived lack of resources presents a unique opportunity for [[challenges_and_potential_for_ai_growth_in_africa | innovation]], as "when you don't have much, that's where you actually produce some of the best innovations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. African countries have a history of leveraging technology to overcome challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. The African fintech space, for example, has developed unique products like M-Pesa, enabling money transfers via cell phone numbers, a game-changer for moving money across regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

Projected fintech revenue growth in Africa between 2021 and 2030 indicates the continent's potential to become a global player in fintech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. Many companies in South Africa are already specializing in the AI space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

## AI Market Growth and Impact in Africa

The international market size for AI in Africa is projected to experience a 17-fold jump between 2020 and 2030, with billions of dollars in investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. The key question is whether this growth truly impacts Africa and its people, not just the technology or markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

### Tackling African Challenges with AI Thinking

Africa often faces "red tape measures" like politics, tax laws, and finances that prevent systemic change, leading to over-engineered solutions rather than addressing the core problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. For instance, the long queues at Home Affairs offices in South Africa are commonly approached with solutions like ticket systems or hiring more staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. However, a different approach, leveraging AI's analytical capabilities, could consider automatically initiating ID or passport applications once a person reaches the qualifying age, eliminating the need for individuals to start the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. This type of [[advancements_in_ai_and_future_implications | innovative thinking]] is not limited to Africa but could solve global problems related to important documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

Examples of this innovative mindset are already present:
*   **Farmer Wings (Nigeria)**: Used to deliver medicine to remote areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.
*   **Project Cumulus (Morocco)**: Produces drinking water from the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.

These are groundbreaking innovations, not just continentally but globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.

## Mindset and Potential for Africa

Africa possesses immense potential, creativity, opportunities, and technological usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. A significant hindrance to its "uprising" (the uprising that AI provides) is sometimes how Africans perceive themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. There's a tendency to feel "below par" or needing to do "over and above" to match other regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>. This mindset can shape how others view the continent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>.

Despite this, global players are investing in Africa's space and using its resources to activate major processes, such as African innovators contributing to the Chinese car revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>. Africa holds about 30% of the world's earth minerals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. Currently, these minerals are often exported, repackaged into finished products elsewhere, and then bought back into the continent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>. This raises the question of whether Africa is recognizing its true potential and the power of unity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>.

Other countries, like China, have transformed their positions by prioritizing internal development before serving the international market, becoming a "global factory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>. Africa's unique position, with fewer resources, drives creativity and allows for rapid development of solutions, many of which are global in scope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>.

## The Future of AI in Africa

AI adoption in Africa is not new, with significant investment in companies and learning spaces, including universities and even primary/high schools, where AI opportunities are being discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:20">[00:23:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>. The South African AI market alone is projected to see close to a 72 million Rand difference in the next 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>.

Africa needs to reimagine how it is perceived and recognize its immense potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>. This means moving beyond theoretical discussions about AI and actively engaging with the available tools and resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>. The question remains: What does AI mean for Africans, and how can it unlock the continent's existing potential, positioning it as an active player on the global stage rather than just a participant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>?

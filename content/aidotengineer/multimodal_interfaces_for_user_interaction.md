Alma, an AI nutrition companion, has gained significant insights into [[improving_user_experience_with_multimodal_interaction | improving user experience with multimodal interaction]] through its development process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. Initially, there was a focus on determining a single "winning" modality for user interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

## Benefits of Multimodal Interaction
The development team at Alma discovered that users highly value the flexibility of [[multimodal_ai_systems | multimodal AI systems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Instead of prioritizing one specific modality, it's crucial to offer users a variety of options that make sense for their context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

### Examples of Modalities in Alma
Alma enables users to interact in several ways for nutrition tracking:
*   **Voice** The voice interface allows users to track meals quickly, such as logging breakfast, lunch, and dinner in under 10 seconds, transforming a previously laborious exercise into a simple one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   **Photo** Users can take a picture of their food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Text** Users can text their food entries to Alma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

Users appreciate that Alma makes it easy to "talk to, to take a photo, or to text," adapting to their current situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. This flexibility contributes significantly to a positive [[user_experience_design_with_ai | user experience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> The key lesson learned is to provide users with as many different modalities as are relevant and sensible for their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

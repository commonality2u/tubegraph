[[Evaluation and feedback in AI systems | Evaluating]] AI models, especially large language models (LLMs), is inherently challenging. LLMs are prone to hallucination and are difficult to [[Evaluation and feedback in AI systems | evaluate]], particularly in conversational settings where objective metrics are scarce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. When dealing with audio and voice agents, these challenges intensify, making development even more arduous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Challenges in AI Agent Evaluation
Building robust AI applications, especially voice agents, goes beyond simple API calls and prompt engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. Several issues highlight the need for comprehensive [[Evaluation and feedback in AI systems | evaluation]]:

*   **Difficulty in Measuring Performance** It's challenging to ascertain how well an AI system is performing, especially in conversational AI where there's no perfect "ground truth" or objective historical data to measure against <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.
*   **Agent Behavior Challenges** AI agents often struggle to maintain a balance, either following up too little or too much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. They might rephrase questions in unhelpful ways or get stuck in "rabbit holes" of chitchat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   **Transcription Inaccuracies** Voice models, even with advanced tools like OpenAI's Whisper, can produce surprising or nonsensical transcripts from silence or background noise, impacting user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   **Complexity from Band-Aid Solutions** Incrementally adding multiple agents to fix issues (e.g., drift detection, next question agents, transcript hiding agents) leads to a complex system with many prompts, making debugging difficult and increasing the risk of introducing regressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

## Solutions and Best Practices for AI Evaluation

To address these [[Challenges in AI agent evaluation | challenges]], a systematic approach to [[Evaluation and feedback in AI systems | evaluation]] is crucial:

*   **Define Metrics and Automated Test Suites**
    *   Develop a set of specific metrics to measure desired attributes of the conversation (e.g., clarity, completeness, professionalism) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.
    *   Implement an automated test suite that uses an LLM as a "judge" to score conversations against these metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. This provides a more objective, metrics-driven iteration process, moving away from subjective "vibes-driven" development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.

*   **Utilize Synthetic Conversations for [[Testing and evaluation of AI models | Testing]]**
    *   Even without perfect ground truth data, create synthetic conversations by using LLMs to simulate various user personas (e.g., "snarky teenager," different job functions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.
    *   Run the AI agent through many synthetic interviews to measure performance against a broad population of expected users and automate testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>.

*   **Implement Out-of-Band Checks and Tool Use**
    *   Introduce separate "side agents" (e.g., a "drift detector" or "next question agent") operating in the text domain to listen to the conversation transcript and make decisions about the conversation's direction, relevance, or progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.
    *   Use "tool use" to constrain and instrument LLM behavior, requiring the LLM to call specific tools to advance the conversation, thereby providing insights into its state and intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.
    *   When adding goals and priorities as first-class concepts to interview plans, inform the LLM not just *what* to ask but *why*, helping it guide follow-up questions and rephrasing more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

[[Improving AI evaluation methods | Evaluations]] are critical for [[Evaluation and feedback in AI systems | measuring success]] and guiding development in all LLM-based projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>. Even in domains without objective truth, harnessing [[Evaluation and feedback in AI systems | evaluations]] can lead to a robust development process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>.

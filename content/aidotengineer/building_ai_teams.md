Heath Black, Managing Director of Product at SignalFire, shares insights on [[hiring_and_building_effective_ai_teams | building AI teams]] based on data from SignalFire's proprietary AI/ML platform, Beacon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:03">[02:29:03]</a>. Beacon tracks over 650 million employees, 80 million companies, and 200 million open-source projects, generating market insights and ranking systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:04">[02:33:04]</a>. The goal is to identify and attract the right talent by focusing on filtering, location, timing, and narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:04">[03:02:04]</a>.

## 1. Filters: Identifying the Right People

When [[hiring_and_building_effective_ai_teams | building AI teams]], it's crucial to apply the right filters in talent searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:30">[03:30:30]</a>. SignalFire data reveals significant trends changing how companies should filter for AI talent:

### De-credentialization of AI Talent
Over the past decade, there has been a stark de-credentialization in AI hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:10">[03:49:10]</a>.
*   **Engineers**: [[tiny_teams_in_ai_startups | AI startups]] are increasingly hiring engineers without PhDs or prestigious schooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:35">[03:53:35]</a>.
    *   In 2015, 27% of engineer hires were from top schools, and 16% had PhDs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.
    *   In 2023, these numbers dropped to 15% and 7% respectively, a 50% decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.
*   **Research Scientists**: While about 40% of research scientists have advanced degrees, this still makes up less than half of those in such roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.

This shift is attributed to a market focus change from foundational ML research (2015) to real-world application, MLOps, product experience, and understanding user interaction with models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

### People Mobility and the "AI V-League"
Historically, AI talent was concentrated in large tech companies like Google, Uber, Meta, and Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. This has shifted, with talent now massively concentrating in what SignalFire calls the "AI V-League" – a group of nine companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>. These established tech giants are now actively trying to recruit from the "AI V-League" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>.

Understanding net employee movement between these companies is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. For example, OpenAI has a positive flow of talent from DeepMind, while Cohere experiences a negative trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>.

#### Takeaways for Filtering:
*   Work experience now far surpasses education in importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>. Focus on a candidate's body of work, including open-source contributions or personal projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>.
*   Assess whether a PhD researcher is truly necessary, or if an experienced engineer will suffice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>.
*   Consider removing or making academic requirements "soft" in job postings to broaden the talent funnel to those with relevant experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>.

## 2. Location: Where to Find Talent

Despite debates about the demise of certain tech hubs, location still significantly matters in [[hiring_and_building_effective_ai_teams | building AI teams]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>.
*   **San Francisco**: Makes up about 29% of all startup engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>. While slightly down from its 2013 peak of 33%, it has been ticking up since 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>. For big tech, 50% of engineers still reside in the San Francisco Bay Area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>.
*   **AI Specifics**: San Francisco leads with 35% of all AI engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. Seattle accounts for 22%, and New York for 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>. These markets are "punching well above their weight" in terms of AI hiring and talent concentration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>.
*   **Funding Correlation**: San Francisco receives nearly 38% of all early-stage funding into [[tiny_teams_in_ai_startups | AI startups]], compared to 26% of total early-stage funding in the U.S <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>. This indicates a strong correlation between funding and talent concentration.

#### Takeaways for Location:
*   Data, not social media debates, determines a market's viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>.
*   Location still matters significantly, even in a distributed work environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>.
*   San Francisco, Seattle, and New York are the premier locations for AI talent and funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>.
*   Continuously monitor location and funding markets to observe talent and capital flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>.

## 3. Timing: When to Engage Talent

Finding the right person is as much about timing as it is about talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>. Timing involves knowing when people are likely to leave their current roles and when they are most inclined to join a company at your stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>.

### Retention Rates and Poachability
Analyzing the retention rates of "AI V-League" companies can indicate when employees are more receptive to outreach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>. For example, Anthropic has a 66% four-year retention rate, while Perplexity AI hovers around 43% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a>. Understanding these rates creates a "poachability score" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>.

### Generational Differences in Job Mobility
Different generations exhibit distinct behaviors regarding job changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>.
*   In 2023, nearly 27% of Gen Z left their jobs, more than double the rate of Gen X <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:00">[12:25:00]</a>.
*   Within four years of graduating, Gen Z averages 2.2 jobs, compared to Gen X's 1.1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:39:00">[12:39:00]</a>.
*   This is partly due to slower promotion rates and layoffs, but largely attributed to Gen Z's "penchant for people to take risk and bet on themselves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:52:00">[12:52:00]</a>.

### Historical Company Composition
SignalFire's "historical composition" tool provides snapshots of admired companies' organizational structures at different points in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:00">[13:42:00]</a>. This includes insights into sales leaders, early engineers, and key product launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:00">[13:54:00]</a>. This data helps identify:
*   A candidate's risk profile – are they willing to join a company at your stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:00">[14:10:00]</a>?
*   Their motivations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">[14:17:00]</a>.
*   Potential for a "10x hire" – an individual who can significantly elevate the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20:00">[14:20:00]</a>.

#### Takeaways for Timing:
*   Understand timing for both outreach and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:29:00">[14:29:00]</a>.
*   Track competitor retention rates and individual profiles for changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:34:00">[14:34:00]</a>.
*   Study generational patterns of job mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>.
*   Know when people join and leave companies to identify 10xers and those likely to join a company at your stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:59:00">[14:59:00]</a>.

## 4. Narrative: Crafting the Right Story

The narrative you present to potential hires is critical, especially as traditional incentives like salary and equity become less dominant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:00">[15:10:00]</a>.

### Moving Beyond Salary and Equity
Historically, pay and equity were the primary components of a recruiting narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:23:00">[16:23:00]</a>. However, reliance on these alone is no longer sustainable:
*   **Salary**: From November 2022 to November 2024, average tech salaries only increased by 1.6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:32:00">[16:32:00]</a>. AI engineers, specifically, command a 5% salary premium and a 10-20% equity premium over other engineering roles, making them even more expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:50:00">[16:50:00]</a>. Therefore, salary as a sole selling point must be abandoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:17:00">[17:17:00]</a>.
*   **Equity**: There has been a precipitous decline in the exercise of vested shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:27:00">[17:27:00]</a>. In Q2 2024, only 33% of people exercised vested shares, down from 55% a few years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:33:00">[17:33:00]</a>. This is driven by concerns over high valuations, the cost of liquid capital, and the rapidly shifting AI market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:47:00">[17:47:00]</a>.

### Emphasizing Non-Monetary Factors
To attract top talent, companies must highlight non-monetary aspects of their offering:
*   A close-knit environment and working with founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:15:00">[18:15:00]</a>.
*   Collaborative teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:20:00">[18:20:00]</a>.
*   Speed and lack of friction in getting work done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:23:00">[18:23:00]</a>.
*   A big mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:25:00">[18:25:00]</a>.
*   Opportunities for personal and career growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:29:00">[18:29:00]</a>.
*   Exploding markets and the chance to solve complex problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:31:00">[18:31:00]</a>.

Understanding your company's "arc" – its triumphs and future direction – is crucial for crafting a compelling narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:00">[16:06:00]</a>.

#### Takeaways for Narrative:
*   Articulate your company's triumphs, current standing, and future direction (your "arc") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:13:00">[16:13:00]</a>.
*   Move beyond salary and equity as primary selling points, as they are no longer sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:10:00">[17:10:00]</a>.
*   Focus on the unique benefits and opportunities your company offers beyond compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:11:00">[18:11:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

In a competitive landscape where many companies are "fishing in the same engineering pond," leveraging recruiting data provides a significant edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:48:00">[18:48:00]</a>. Just as data is used to [[best_practices_for_building_ai_systems | build AI systems]] and models, it should be used to [[hiring_and_building_effective_ai_teams | build AI teams]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:59:00">[18:59:00]</a>.

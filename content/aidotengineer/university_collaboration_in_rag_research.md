The Open [[open_rag_eval_project_overview | RAG Eval]] project, which provides tools for quick and scalable [[evaluation_and_improvement_of_RAG_solutions | RAG evaluation]], is grounded in research conducted in collaboration with the University of Waterloo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Jimmy Lynn Lab Partnership
Specifically, the research backing the Open [[open_rag_eval_project_overview | RAG Eval]] project was performed with the Jimmy Lynn lab at the University of Waterloo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This collaboration contributes to the project's methodology, particularly in the development of its [[metrics_for_RAG_evaluation | evaluation metrics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Research-Backed Metrics
One key example of this collaboration's impact is the `Umbrella` metric for [[retrieval augmented generation RAG | RAG retrieval]] evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Research from the University of Waterloo lab of Jim Lynn indicates that using the `Umbrella` approach for [[rag_evaluation_without_golden_answers | RAG evaluation without golden answers]] correlates well with human judgment, providing reliable results even without golden chunks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

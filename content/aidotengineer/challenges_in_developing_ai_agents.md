The year 2025 is considered by many as the "AI agent moment" and a "perfect storm for AI agents," given rapid advancements in reasoning models, test-time compute, engineering optimizations, decreasing inference costs, and massive infrastructure investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. However, despite this excitement, AI agents are "not really working just yet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

An AI agent is defined as a fully autonomous system where Large Language Models (LLMs) direct their own actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. The primary obstacle to their effective operation is the accumulation of "tiny cumulative errors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

## Types of Cumulative Errors

Common errors observed in AI agents include:

*   **Decision Error** The agent chooses the wrong fact, such as booking a flight to "San Francisco, Peru" instead of "San Francisco, California" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
*   **Implementation Error** This involves incorrect access or integration, like encountering a CAPTCHA that disrupts the flow or being locked out of a critical database, preventing the agent from functioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
*   **Heuristic Error** The agent uses the wrong criteria, failing to account for factors like rush hour traffic or origin location when booking a flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   **Taste Error** The agent fails to incorporate personal preferences, such as booking a disliked aircraft type, even if not explicitly stated in the initial prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   **Perfection Paradox** While AI performs "magical" tasks, human users become frustrated when an agent is slow or inconsistent, even if it eventually gets the task right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. This unreliability often leads to an underwhelming experience that doesn't meet human expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

These errors compound significantly in complex, multi-agent systems involving multi-step tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. For example, an agent with 99% accuracy can drop to 60% accuracy after 50 consecutive steps, while a 95% accurate agent falls to less than 10% in the same scenario, demonstrating a 50% disparity between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

## Strategies to Mitigate [[challenges_in_creating_personal_ai_agents | Challenges in Developing AI Agents]]

To address these [[challenges_in_building_reliable_ai_agents | challenges in building reliable AI agents]], five key strategies are crucial for [[developing_and_optimizing_ai_agents | developing and optimizing AI agents]]:

### 1. Data Curation
Ensure the AI agent has the necessary information, managing messy, unstructured, and siloed data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. This includes proprietary data, data generated by the agent itself, and data used for quality control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. Designing an "agent data flywheel" from day one allows the product to improve automatically and at scale every time a user interacts with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

### 2. Evaluations (Evals)
Establish methods to collect and measure a model's responses and determine the correct answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. While straightforward in verifiable domains like math or science, [[challenges_in_ai_agent_evaluation | evaluating AI agents]] for non-verifiable systems (e.g., subjective preferences) requires collecting human preferences and building truly personal evaluations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

### 3. Scaffolding Systems
Design systems to prevent one error from cascading throughout the entire agentic system or production infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. This involves building complex compound systems and, at times, reintroducing a human into the loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Future improvements include self-healing agents that correct their own paths or pause execution when unsure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

### 4. User Experience (UX)
Focus on reimagining product experiences and deeply understanding user workflows to promote human-machine collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. Since many AI apps use the same foundation models, exceptional UX and product quality are critical differentiators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. This involves asking clarifying questions, predicting user next steps, and seamlessly integrating with legacy systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. Industries with proprietary data and deep user workflow knowledge, such as robotics, hardware, defense, manufacturing, and life sciences, offer significant opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

### 5. Multimodality
Move beyond traditional chatbot interfaces and build agents that leverage new modalities to create a 10x personalized user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. This means adding "eyes, ears, nose, a voice," and even the sense of touch through robotics, to make AI more human and embodied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. Incorporating "memories" can also make AI truly personal and deeply understanding of the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.

While we are at the "perfect storm" for AI agents, their full potential has not yet been realized due to cumulative errors leading to wrong answers, preferences, and human expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. Addressing these [[design_challenges_for_ai_agents | design challenges for AI agents]] through data curation, evaluations, scaffolding, superior UX, and multimodality will be key to creating visionary products that set new standards for human-AI interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.

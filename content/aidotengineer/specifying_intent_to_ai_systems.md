Specifying intent to AI systems is identified as the second of four patterns in [[Strategies for effective AI implementation | AI-native development]], representing a shift from focusing on implementation details to defining desired outcomes for AI agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>. This means developers increasingly care less about the actual implementation and more about communicating what they want the agents to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>.

## Evolution of Intent Specification

*   **Markdown Specification Files**
    Initially, a simple markdown file could be added to a prompt as a specification, offering a basic way to define shared functional or technical requirements without repeatedly rewriting them in the prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>.

*   **AI-Generated Plans**
    Once the desired elements are defined, AI can assist in building a detailed plan. GitHub, for example, has added task-oriented capabilities that translate user intent into step-by-step actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>.

*   **Intent-Based Coding**
    This approach moves beyond simple chat interactions or text completion. It involves defining tasks, allowing the AI to build a plan, and then generating the code based on that plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>.

*   **Specification-Centric Tools**
    The direction of tools is becoming increasingly specification-centric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>. In this model, the code itself may not be the primary focus; instead, the workflow revolves around specifying functional, technical, and security requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>.

*   **Program Manager Role**
    Ultimately, the process could evolve to a point where one primarily manages the process as a program manager, rather than directly overseeing the coding process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>.

This pattern indicates a shift for developers towards roles similar to QA or architects, focusing on defining and guiding the AI's creation process through clear intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:00">[12:51:00]</a>.

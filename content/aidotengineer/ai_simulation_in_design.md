Alex Les, VP of Data Science and AI at Huge design and technology company, discusses how teams can utilize [[AI simulation in design | AI simulation]] to accelerate design, focusing on "invisible users" and "invisible interfaces" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The discussion covers the current state of UX and AI, potential future states, and a proposed method to achieve them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## The Current State of AI and UX

Currently, AI faces a "trust gap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Research from December 2024 by Edelman indicated that only 32% of US adults trust AI, and 44% of adults globally are comfortable with businesses using AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This gap is attributed to "AI slop," where generative AI fails, such as incorrect web search results or unrealistic product pricing on websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Many website creators are "stuffing AI chatbots" everywhere, presenting it as magic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

However, the true "magic" of Generative AI (GenAI) is its capacity as a UX revolution, allowing users to interact with machine learning models using natural language, a previously impossible feat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## The Opportunity: Invisible Interfaces and [[AI Accelerated Need Finding | AI Accelerated Need Finding]]

Revisiting UX first principles, the concept of "invisible interfaces" by Don Norman (author of *The Invisible Computer*) describes software so seamless and intuitive that users forget they are using it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. The opportunity for AI is to design interfaces that genuinely feel like magic, not through poorly integrated chatbots, but by accelerating the "need finding" phase of design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. While the presenter is a data scientist and not a designer, a process for delivering [[AI accelerated need finding | AI accelerated need finding]] is proposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

## A New Approach to the Design Life Cycle

The current design process, pre-ChatGPT, is data-driven, relying on qualitative, quantitative, and ethnographic observations to guide [[prototyping and production in AI | prototyping]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The proposed new approach for design is analogous to pilot training, which heavily uses simulation for operating in complex environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

This evolution involves empowering designers to work with "invisible users" in the form of [[AI simulation in design | AI simulation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. This turns traditionally collected data artifacts from need finding into active participants in the design process, providing designers with a mini feedback cycle to refine designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## Accelerated Need Finding Process with AI Simulation

The new process for need finding in the era of [[AI simulation in design | AI simulation]] shares many similarities with existing methods, including:
1.  Defining the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
2.  Mapping their intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
3.  Identifying specific tasks to accomplish intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
4.  Conducting analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
5.  Refining insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
6.  Developing design alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

However, key differences arise in the components and workflow with [[AI simulation in design | AI simulation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

### Defining Audiences with Data
The process starts by utilizing data that represents target audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. Huge's internal data platform, "Live," contains demographic, psychographic, and contextual data to simulate audience behaviors, forming a critical foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

### Intent Mapping with Intelligent Twins
The data is then transformed into an active simulation called an "intelligent twin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. An intelligent twin represents user behaviors, desired outcomes, needs, and motivations, becoming an active participant in the design simulation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

### Briefing Intelligent Twins
Intelligent twins can be briefed to evaluate interfaces by focusing on specific tasks, similar to how a human designer might conduct a heuristic analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. This allows for the evaluation of specific interfaces or websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

## Example Project: Global Audit of Sports Websites

To demonstrate the advantages of this simulated methodology, particularly its scale and speed, a sample project was conducted: a global audit of sports websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. This scenario imagined a business wanting to partner with global sports leagues and understand how to engage audiences across different countries and cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### Project Setup
Two personas were created: a casual fan new to sports and a lifelong, savvy super fan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Across three different sports websites (basketball, Olympics, English Premier League), a series of tasks were briefed for intelligent twins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. These tasks spanned categories like navigation, information architecture, and fan engagement, with four tasks per category, resulting in 72 AI-simulated actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

### Findings
The speed and scale of intelligent twins allow for high-level insights across an entire category or granular dives into specific areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. The audit revealed that navigation on all sites performed well in terms of task completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. However, as fans went deeper into browsing content, information architecture, and engagement pathways, initial successes dropped off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. This highlights user pain points that, when addressed, can help repair the AI trust gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

The methodology can also scale to surface friction in specific, nuanced areas of the experience, enabling the creation of focused, broad, and deep design briefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. Utilizing computer vision models and human-in-the-loop observation, the process can generate design briefs that allow human teams to focus on critical user pain points, thereby accelerating and improving the [[Design process improvements with AI | design process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

## Future Outlook and Limitations

Significant progress is anticipated, with tools like Anthropic's MCP protocol potentially integrating prototype components from Figma directly into code components for frameworks like React or Node.js <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. This acceleration in design tool capabilities emphasizes the importance of focusing on "the why"—the strategy and the problem users need solved—as "the how" becomes increasingly easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

This methodology is currently experimental. Limitations and areas for improvement include:
*   **Reproducibility**: Standardizing parameters like briefing instructions, simulated audience dimensions, audit runs, and task completion/failure parameters in a code repository <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **Test and Control**: Applying a test and control methodology to isolate the strengths of intelligent twins for [[AI accelerated need finding | AI accelerated need finding]] and determine how they can complement human teams across various industries, geographies, and domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

## Conclusion

To repair the current AI trust gap, the focus should shift from force-feeding users ineffective GenAI chatbots to providing better websites, mobile apps, and interfaces that offer clarity and simplicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. [[AI simulation in design | AI simulation]] can be a powerful tool to empower design teams to gather insights smarter, faster, and better, ultimately creating interfaces that restore and repair user trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

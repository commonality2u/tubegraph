AI simulation in design is a methodology that leverages artificial intelligence to accelerate the design process, particularly in the "need finding" phase, by simulating user behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The goal is to empower designers with a faster and smarter way to gather insights, ultimately leading to clearer, simpler, and more trustworthy digital interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

## The AI Trust Gap

Currently, AI faces a significant trust gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Research from December 2024 by Edelman indicated that only 32% of US adults trust AI, and merely 44% globally feel comfortable with businesses using AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This lack of trust is attributed to "AI slop," where AI-powered features in websites or products fail to provide correct information, such as suggesting eating rocks or buying a car for $1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Often, companies are "stuffing AI chatbots" into everything and calling it magic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## The Opportunity: Invisible Interfaces and Need Finding

The true "magic" of Generative AI lies in its ability to enable users to converse with machine learning models in natural language, a previously impossible feat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This capability presents an opportunity to return to UX first principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

Inspired by Don Norman's concept of "invisible interfaces"—software so seamless and intuitive that users forget they're using it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>—AI can be used to design interfaces that genuinely feel magical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. This is achieved not by superficial chatbot integration, but by accelerating "need finding" in the design process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Need finding involves understanding user problems and motivations to inform design solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

### AI Accelerated Need Finding Process

Traditionally, the design process is data-driven, relying on qualitative observations, quantitative data, and ethnographic studies to guide prototyping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. The proposed new approach involves empowering designers to work with "invisible users" in the form of [[Intelligent Twins in Design Simulation | AI simulation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. This transforms static data artifacts from need finding into active participants in the design process, providing designers with a mini feedback cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

The new process for need finding with [[Intelligent Twins in Design Simulation | AI simulation]] shares similarities with existing methods but introduces key differences in components and workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>:

1.  **Defining the Audience**: Start with data representing audiences, utilizing platforms with demographic, psychographic, and contextual datasets to simulate behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
2.  **Intent Mapping**: Turn this audience data into active simulations known as [[Intelligent Twins in Design Simulation | intelligent twins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. These twins represent user behaviors, desired outcomes, needs, and motivations, becoming active participants in design simulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
3.  **Task Briefing**: [[Intelligent Twins in Design Simulation | Intelligent twins]] can be briefed to evaluate interfaces by focusing on specific tasks, similar to how a human designer might conduct a heuristic analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

### Example Project: Global Sports Website Audit

To illustrate the methodology, a sample project audited global sports websites from the perspective of a business partnering with sports leagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. This project aimed to demonstrate the scale and speed advantages of the simulated methodology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

*   **Personas**: Two personas were defined: a casual fan new to the sport and a lifelong, savvy super fan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
*   **Tasks**: Across three different websites (basketball, Olympics, English Premier League), a series of tasks were briefed to the [[Intelligent Twins in Design Simulation | intelligent twins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. These tasks fell into categories like navigation, information architecture, and fan engagement, with four tasks per category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>, resulting in 72 AI-simulated actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Findings**:
    *   Navigation tasks showed good performance across all sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
    *   However, performance dropped significantly for deeper tasks involving browsing content, information architecture, and engagement pathways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
    *   These findings highlighted user pain points that, if addressed, could help repair the "AI trust gap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
*   **Benefits**: The speed and scale of [[Intelligent Twins in Design Simulation | intelligent twins]] allow for high-level insights across an entire category or granular detail on specific friction points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. This process, using computer vision models and human-in-the-loop observation, can generate focused design briefs for human teams to solve user pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

## Future Considerations and Limitations

As tools for creating new designs accelerate (e.g., Anthropic's MCP protocol turning Figma prototypes into code components) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, it becomes increasingly important to focus on "the why"—the strategy and the user problem to be solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

This methodology is still in experimental early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. Key considerations for improvement include:

*   **Reproducibility**: Standardizing parameters in a code repository, such as briefing instructions, simulated audience dimensions, audit runs, and task completion/failure parameters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **Validation**: Applying a test and control methodology to isolate the strengths of [[Intelligent Twins in Design Simulation | intelligent twins]] for design need finding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. This will help understand how AI simulation can complement human teams across different industries, geographies, and domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

Ultimately, users don't need more ineffective GenAI chatbots; they need better websites, mobile apps, and interfaces that offer clarity and simplicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. [[Intelligent Twins in Design Simulation | AI simulation]] can be a powerful tool to empower design teams to achieve this, restoring and repairing the trust gap in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.

The emergence of [[ai_in_workplaces | AI]] is profoundly redefining how businesses operate, leading to a distinction between companies that are merely "AI enhanced" and those that are truly "AI native" or "agent native" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. This shift is not just a technological trend but a fundamental re-evaluation of teams, workflows, and even hiring practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

## Defining AI Native Companies

An "AI native" company is fundamentally different from a business that merely uses [[ai_in_enterprise_applications | AI]] as a tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. It's a company built from the ground up with [[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents | AI agents]] at its core, designed to augment human productivity and intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. For these companies, [[integrating_ai_into_business_operations | AI is embedded]] into the very foundation of their product, operations, and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. It's not a "fancy side feature" or a "bolt-on" but the engine driving the company forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

In an AI native business, every employee relies on [[ai_in_workplaces | AI]] to do their job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. If [[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents | agents]] were removed from their workflow, employees would struggle to get tasks done, and the company would not move as fast, leading to increased costs and decreased productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Products without this core [[ai_in_enterprise_applications | AI integration]] would feel old, unintelligent, and less useful, failing to help customers achieve significant gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

### AI Enhanced vs. Agent Native

The key distinction lies in dependency and integration:

*   **AI Enhanced Business**: This type of business uses [[ai_in_enterprise_applications | AI]] intermittently for efficiency gains, like chatting with an [[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents | AI]] or getting a document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Such a company would still function if [[ai_in_workplaces | AI]] were removed, albeit less efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. This is likened to a car with driver assist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   **Agent Native Business**: This business model resembles a car on autopilot, where humans direct the autopilot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Every employee focuses on higher-level navigation and the success of the company, while routine and mundane tasks, along with micro-decisions, are offloaded to [[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

The transition to an [[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents | AI native model]] is viewed as a transformative shift, comparable to the industrial revolution or the advent of the car, redefining how businesses are structured and how work gets done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

## Attributes of an Agent Native Company

While still in early stages, several defining characteristics mark an [[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents | agent native company]]:

*   **AI at the Core of Everything**: [[ai_in_workplaces | AI]] is pervasive, integrated across all departmentsâ€”product, customer support, and operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. The expectation is that every department has [[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents | agents]] performing routine and key daily work, with interfaces and handoffs between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. The removal of these [[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents | agents]] would result in significant productivity loss and manual coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
*   **Humans as Conductors**: In an [[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents | AI native company]], people are no longer mere cogs in a machine; they act as conductors or orchestrators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This requires a different hiring profile and leads to flatter, leaner organizational charts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. Middle management layers can shrink as [[ai_in_enterprise_applications | intelligent systems]] handle much of the coordination and execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
*   **Experimentation and Iterative Culture**: While core to many tech startups, the [[building_and_scaling_ai_use_cases_for_enterprises | ultimate realization of an iterative approach]] is possible when [[ai_in_workplaces | AI]] handles routine work and assists with prototypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. This allows humans to focus on higher-value tasks and continuous learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. [[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents | Agents]] can learn and improve over time, becoming a "superpower" for tasks like code documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

These attributes combine to form an organization that operates on a completely different model than traditional companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

## The Typical Agent Native Workday

The workday in an [[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents | agent native company]] includes new responsibilities, primarily overseeing what [[ai_in_workplaces | AI]] is doing or has done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

For example, a typical morning might involve reviewing a log of tasks completed by [[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents | AI agents]] overnight, and then kicking off new, larger thinking tasks or product ideas by interacting with [[ai_in_workplaces | AI models]] like ChatGPT or Deep Research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. By the time a human addresses a to-do item, [[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents | AI agents]] might have already generated initial thoughts, created pull requests (PRs), or started working on bug fixes and documentation issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

In essence, the morning involves checking what [[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents | agents]] accomplished and initiating new tasks, with a review of their output (e.g., PRs, collateral, emails) happening around lunchtime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. Every employee essentially becomes a lead manager of their [[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents | AI agent]] counterparts, orchestrating multiple [[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents | agents]] to achieve specific jobs, such as optimizing content and scheduling social media posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. This leverages human expertise with asynchronous [[ai_in_workplaces | AI]] workloads, preparing tasks before a human even starts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

This leads to flatter team structures and potentially new job titles that combine domain expertise with [[ai_in_workplaces | AI]] know-how, such as "AI Engineer" or "AI Customer Lead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

## Rethinking Hiring

The requirements for hiring in an [[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents | agent native company]] are also different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. Curiosity and adaptability become highly demanded traits for creative and leadership roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

### AI Fluency as a Must-Have
[[ai_in_workplaces | AI]] fluency becomes a mandatory skill, much like knowing how to use a word processor in a traditional office job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. Companies are becoming skeptical of candidates unfamiliar with [[ai_in_workplaces | AI]], seeking individuals who can effectively guide [[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents | AI agents]] and learn the intricacies of working with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.

The focus shifts in hiring leaders; a VP, for instance, might be hired not just for their network or experience, but for their ability to use [[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents | AI agents]] and bring in team members with [[ai_in_workplaces | AI]] fluency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.

Onboarding processes also adapt, with new hires potentially spending their first few weeks focused solely on setting up their [[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents | AI agents]] to perform their job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. It may even become reasonable to attach an engineer to a team specifically to ensure their [[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents | agents]] are up and running <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.

## Conclusion

The shift towards [[integration_of_ai_in_business_operations | AI-driven businesses]] is a profound one, with a ceiling of potential that is not yet fully understood, akin to the early days of the automobile industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. [[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents | AI agents]] are expected to be deeply embedded in every aspect of business, requiring a rethinking of roles, skills, culture, and operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.

Companies are moving beyond simply using [[ai_in_workplaces | AI]] as a tool; they are being built around [[ai_in_enterprise_applications | AI]] as a core primitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. This shift, from "driver assisted" to "AI automated," offers significant opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. Small teams leveraging [[ai_in_workplaces | AI tools]] and [[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents | agents]] can achieve unprecedented speeds in infrastructure development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>.

For founders and tech leaders, embracing this paradigm shift is crucial, even if it means re-evaluating years of built-up experience that might no longer be entirely valid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>. Relying only on [[ai_in_workplaces | AI]] for small efficiency gains risks falling behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. The recommendation is to start from first principles, reimagine, and refit companies and cultures for this future, rewiring processes to allow human-to-[[agentic_enterprise_and_ai_agents | agent]] teams to scale impact exponentially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>. This may involve redesigning organizational charts and redefining roles and skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>.

The ultimate question for businesses is: Is your company merely using [[ai_in_workplaces | AI]], or is it ready to be built around [[ai_in_enterprise_applications | AI]]? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>

The deployment of [[AI agents in DevOps | Enterprise AI]] agents presents a unique challenge: integrating powerful models within existing security boundaries and workflows without creating parallel systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Instead of building new external systems, the focus should be on leveraging decades of existing [[ai_network_infrastructure | Enterprise Infrastructure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## A New Computing Paradigm
Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a significant shift in computing, allowing [[AI agents in DevOps | AI agents]] to understand requests, grasp context, and interact naturally through established channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Traditionally, deploying AI agents often leads to creating new external systems, portals, credentials, and security reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This approach risks rebuilding barriers between users and new capabilities, rather than embracing the paradigm where agents use human-like interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, observed a fundamental shift in business software, suggesting that "SaaS is dead" as [[AI agents in DevOps | AI agents]] become the primary interface with business systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Building new AI portals and dashboards, therefore, recreates an increasingly obsolete pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## AI Agents as Digital Employees
[[Enterprise AI within security boundaries | Enterprise AI]] agents should operate like any other employee, adhering to security policies, utilizing approved systems, staying within data boundaries, accessing only necessary information, and being monitored and audited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

The good news is that enterprises already possess the necessary infrastructure:
*   Secure compute environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>
*   Identity management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>
*   Data governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>
*   Compliance frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>
*   Audit capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>

These systems have been refined over decades, and most companies have their own private cloud environments where [[AI agents in DevOps | AI agents]] can execute within their security boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Modern [[ai_network_infrastructure | AI infrastructure]] enables running agents in private clouds, keeping data within tenants, leveraging existing security controls and workflows, and maintaining complete oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This means AI can be deployed with the same privacy controls applied to human employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

Instead of creating new interfaces for [[AI agents in DevOps | AI agents]], which risks solving "yesterday's problem," organizations should consider if new capabilities can be delivered through systems users already know and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

## [[AI in IT infrastructure management | IT as HR for AI Agents]]
[[AI in IT infrastructure management | IT departments]] can provision [[AI agents in DevOps | AI agents]] exactly like human employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. As Jensen Huang of NVIDIA noted, "the IT department of every company is going to be the HR department of AI agents in the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

IT teams can:
*   Create agent accounts using existing Active Directory tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   Apply standard security policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   Set permissions through familiar interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   Utilize existing audit and monitoring tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

This approach means no new systems to learn or special handling, treating [[AI agents in DevOps | AI agents]] as another employee to manage with existing tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

### Agent-to-Agent Communication
Email can serve as a powerful pattern for agent-to-agent communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Just as humans use email to collaborate, [[AI agents in DevOps | AI agents]] can email each other to share data and coordinate work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. This ensures:
*   Full logging and auditability of every interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
*   Automatic permission enforcement through existing systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   Transparent and controllable data flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

This framework supports building observable and controllable [[ai_in_enterprise_applications | AI systems]] at [[best_practices_for_ai_deployment_and_optimization | Enterprise Scale]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. While the Microsoft ecosystem (e.g., Microsoft 365, Azure) is highlighted as an example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>, these patterns apply to other [[ai_in_enterprise_applications | Enterprise Platforms]] like Google Workspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

## Enhancing Existing Systems
The key insight for [[strategies_for_ai_model_deployment | AI Engineers]] is to leverage existing [[ai_network_infrastructure | Enterprise Infrastructure]] rather than building parallel systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. These platforms provide built-in identity management, established security controls, proven compliance frameworks, and [[ai_in_enterprise_applications | Enterprise-grade APIs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. This allows focusing energy on building new capabilities and solving problems instead of reinventing infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

The future of [[enterprise_ai_within_security_boundaries | Enterprise AI]] involves enhancing existing systems that have been perfected over decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. Existing systems such as document management, internal messaging, and workflow tools become potential gateways for [[AI in enterprise applications | AI capabilities]] once software agents can directly understand human intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

This shift in approach means asking which existing systems can be enhanced with [[AI agents in DevOps | AI agents]], rather than what new tools need to be built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. The most powerful solution may be the "quiet intelligence" added to tools customers already trust and use daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. The era of mandatory translation layers between humans and machines is ending, giving way to direct understanding and seamless [[AI in enterprise applications | AI collaboration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

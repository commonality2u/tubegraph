Building a GenAI platform requires a dedicated and skilled team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. The approach to [[rethinking_hiring_and_company_culture_with_ai | hiring]] for such a team has evolved due to the unique nature of GenAI systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.

## Why Build an Internal AI Team?
The traditional separation between AI model optimization and model serving phases is disappearing in GenAI systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. In GenAI, everyone acts as an engineer who can optimize overall system performance, creating new challenges for tooling and [[best_practices_for_building_ai_systems | best practices]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. GenAI systems, or agent systems, are considered "compound AI systems" which tackle tasks using multiple interacting components, bridging the gap between AI engineers and product engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. A dedicated platform team is critical to bridge the skill gaps between these two groups of engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

## Ideal Candidate Profile
An ideal candidate for a GenAI team is a strong software engineer who can build infrastructure integrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. They should possess good developer product management (PM) skills to design interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. Ideally, they would also have an AI and data science background to understand the latest techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. These individuals are capable of learning the latest techniques while remaining hands-on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.

However, finding such a candidate is rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

## [[rethinking_hiring_and_company_culture_with_ai | Hiring]] Principles
When [[rethinking_hiring_and_company_culture_with_ai | hiring]] for GenAI teams, several principles can guide the process given the difficulty in finding unicorn candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>:

*   **Prioritize Software Engineering Skills**: Strong software engineering skills are generally prioritized over AI expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.
*   **Hire for Potential**: Due to the rapid evolution of the field, it's more effective to hire for potential rather than just experience or degrees, as much experience can quickly become outdated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.
*   **Emphasize Critical Thinking**: A constant in this rapidly changing field is that solutions built today might be outdated in less than six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. Teams must consistently evaluate new open-source packages, engage with vendors, and proactively deprecate their solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

## Team Composition
Instead of seeking a single engineer with all desired qualifications, a diversified team approach is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. A diversified team might include:
*   Full-stack software engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>
*   Data scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>
*   AI engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>
*   Data engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>
*   Fresh graduates from top research universities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>
*   Individuals with startup backgrounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>

When these diverse skill sets are brought together on a project, strong engineers tend to pick up new skills through collaboration and grow into more ideal candidates over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

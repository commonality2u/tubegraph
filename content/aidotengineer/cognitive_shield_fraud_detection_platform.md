Cognitive Shield is a next-generation platform engineered to protect financial ecosystems against sophisticated, AI-driven fraud threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. It addresses the challenge of detecting "intelligence" rather than just traditional fraud, as modern threats often blend in and get verified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

## The Evolution of Fraud: AI-Driven Threats

The landscape of fraud has evolved beyond "old school fraud" to include sophisticated [[aigenerated_deep_fake_scams_and_synthetic_identities | synthetic identities]], deepfake onboarding, and AI-driven scams that appear more human than human itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. These threats often bypass traditional detection methods, walking through the "front door" undetected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

### Examples of AI-Driven Scams
*   **Deepfake Scams**: A voice identical to a manager asks for confidential information to be sent to a personal email, only for the victim to later discover it was a deepfake scam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Similarly, a face appearing on screen for video KYC might blink and smile naturally, yet be an [[aigenerated_deep_fake_scams_and_synthetic_identities | AI-generated deepfake]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Voice Cloning Scams**: Anthony, a retired father, received a panicked call from a voice undeniably his son's, claiming an accident and needing $50,000 for bail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. He wired his entire retirement savings, later realizing it was an [[aigenerated_deep_fake_scams_and_synthetic_identities | AI-generated voice clone]] created from publicly available TikTok videos of his son <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   **Pig Butchering Scams**: Lisa, feeling isolated, was messaged on Instagram by a man claiming to be a famous Australian TV star who called her his "soulmate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Over 18 months, she sent nearly $40,000 in savings, only to discover his face was [[aigenerated_deep_fake_scams_and_synthetic_identities | AI-generated]] and it was a scam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. These scams build fake relationships, often using AI and crypto to hide tracks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Cryptocurrency Rugpulls**: Xavier, an accountant, invested $60,000 of his savings and his entire 401k into "ZipMax Pro," a flashy cryptocurrency project that appeared legitimate with a professional website, testimonials, whitepapers, active Discord, and even deepfake videos of Elon Musk endorsing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. The creators then executed a classic "rugpull," causing the coin's value to plummet and Xavier to lose everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. Every element of this scam was powered by AI, including fake ID verification, deepfake endorsements, AI-written smart contracts, social media bots, and synthetic influencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

### Current Statistics

### [[Graphpowered AI for uncovering fraud networks | Graph-Powered AI for Uncovering Fraud Networks]]
Fraud often involves networks of connected people, accounts, and devices, making it crucial to focus on connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>. Cognitive Shield employs a three-step process:
1.  **Building the Graph**: Unstructured data (text, PDFs, forms, emails, logs) is converted into a structured graphical knowledge base using agentic workflows built with Crew AI and large language models (LLMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>. This graph is enriched with internal PostgreSQL database information to create a real-time view of the fraud landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>. GNN models are then used to find hidden connections, such as synchronized accounts or devices reused across fake identities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>.
2.  **Graph Persistence**: Neo4j is used as a graph persistent mechanism to store all graphs, nodes, and relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>.
3.  **Asking Graph Smart Questions**: A Neo4j-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system integrates with LLMs to convert natural language user queries into Cypher language, enabling real-time exploitation of graph relationships and surfacing patterns that traditional relational systems miss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>.

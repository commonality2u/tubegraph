The Benefits of AI Primitives in Production

AI primitives offer a superior approach to [[challenges_and_strategies_in_ai_production | building and scaling AI agents in production]] compared to traditional AI frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Production-ready AI agents, such as those found in Perplexity, Cursor, and Chai, consistently demonstrate a common theme: they are not built on top of AI frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

### Why Primitives Over Frameworks?
Frameworks are often criticized for being bloated, slow-moving, and filled with unnecessary abstractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. They introduce obscure abstractions that are difficult to debug, complicating the process of [[scaling_ai_agents_in_production | deploying and scaling AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. In a rapidly evolving field where new paradigms and LLMs emerge frequently, frameworks can become restrictive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>. Building with [[ai_primitives_versus_frameworks | AI primitives]] allows for greater flexibility and adaptability, making it easier to integrate new advancements without being constrained by a pre-built abstraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.

Instead, [[building_ai_agents_using_primitives | AI primitives]] provide small, composable building blocks that are natively well-suited for production environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. An analogy is Amazon S3, a simple, low-level primitive for object storage that scales massively without needing a framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. This approach aims to provide the fastest possible way to [[developing_ai_agents_for_productivity | build a production-ready AI agent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

### Key AI Primitives and Their Benefits
Commonly used AI primitives include:
*   **Memory** (e.g., `langbase.memories`): An autonomous long-term storage engine that can incorporate vector stores, handling terabytes of data and scaling automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.
*   **Threads**: Used to store and manage context and conversation history for an agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. This allows for asynchronous context management and scratchpad functionality, similar to retaining information when booking a flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
*   **Parser**: Extracts context from various file types, converting them into a usable format (e.g., PDF to text) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
*   **Chunker**: Splits large pieces of extracted context into smaller, manageable chunks for efficient similarity search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   **Tools Infrastructure**: Enables agents to automatically call external APIs and connect to microservices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
*   **Workflow Engine**: Purpose-built for multi-step agent processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

When [[building_ai_agents_using_primitives | AI agents are built with predefined, highly scalable, and composable AI primitives]], especially those with integrated cloud capabilities, the result is a serverless AI agent that can automatically handle heavy lifting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

### Common AI Agent Architectures Built with Primitives
AI primitives enable the construction of 80% of even the most complex AI agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>. Here are several architectures implemented using primitives:

*   **Augmented LLM**: An agent that combines an LLM with tools, threads, and memory to generate output from input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. This versatile architecture can be used to build almost any type of AI agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.
*   **Prompt Chaining and Composition**: Involves using multiple agents (e.g., summary, features, marketing copy agents) that work together in a sequence, where the output of one agent determines the next step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. This is typically implemented with plain JavaScript or TypeScript <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.
*   **Agent Router (LLM Router)**: An agent or LLM that decides which other specialized agent should be called next based on the input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. For example, a router can direct queries to a summary agent, reasoning agent, or coding agent, each potentially using a different LLM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.
*   **Parallel Agents**: Allows multiple agents to run concurrently to achieve a task, such as a sentiment analysis, summary, and decision-maker agent all running at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. This is straightforward to implement with `Promise.all` in JavaScript <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.
*   **Agent Orchestrator/Worker**: An orchestrator agent plans and creates subtasks, which are then distributed to multiple worker agents for execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. The results from the worker agents are synthesized by another agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. This architecture is common in deep research agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.
*   **Evaluator/Optimizer**: An agent generates a response (e.g., marketing copy), which is then evaluated by another LLM acting as a judge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>. The judge accepts or rejects the response, providing feedback for improvement and iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. This evaluation agent should be built with the best possible LLM for the specific domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>.
*   **Memory Agent**: Involves uploading data to a memory primitive and then using an agent to retrieve data and answer questions from that uploaded data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>.

By using [[ai_primitives_versus_frameworks | AI primitives]], engineers can focus on [[building_ai_agents_using_primitives | building powerful AI agents]] that are natively scalable and adaptable to new advancements, avoiding the limitations of bloated frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>. This approach simplifies the [[prototyping_and_production_environments_in_ai_solutions | development-to-production pipeline]], allowing rapid deployment and use of agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>.

Hubert Mishtella, who leads AI researchers in drug design at Novardis, presented on "Agentic Enterprise: What Your CEO Must Know About AI" at the AI Engineer World's Fair 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The presentation covered various aspects of [[AI in Workplaces | AI]] including workflows, networks, challenges, and the individual employee's perspective on how AI agents might be used and their organizational impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## The Rise of AI Agents in Enterprise
It is suggested that within three years, organizations might be run by AI agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. An [[AI in enterprise applications | AI agent]] is a large language model (LLM)-based application that exhibits autonomy in its behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. They are composed of a language model that connects various tools, executing tasks through step-by-step planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. The use of these tools can be dynamically adjusted based on the outcome of previous steps, known as dynamic action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Key Capabilities of AI Agents
AI agents introduce capabilities previously almost unique to humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>:
*   **Reasoning for multi-step planning** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>
*   **Adaptability for dynamic work control** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>
*   **Persistent memory** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>
*   **Contextual knowledge (Retrieval Augmented Generation - RAG)**: Utilizing specific knowledge not available in the language model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   **Interactive workspaces**: Collaborating with an AI agent in sandboxes or canvases to refine tasks like code or art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   **Computer-using agents**: Navigating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to automate steps previously done by humans or robotic process [[automation of manual workflows with ai_web_agents | automation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

Many companies are already working on evolving their digital assets for [[AI in enterprise applications | AI agent]] usage, aiming for every digital asset to become a tool for an AI agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## Workflow Perspective: Automation and Augmentation
A workflow is the execution of a process, often involving sequential steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Technology can be used in two primary ways:
*   **Automation**: Substituting a specific step with technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   **Augmentation**: Performing a step quicker or better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

While machine learning (ML) could previously automate or augment some tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, [[applications_of_ai_in_productivity_and_automation | AI agents]] offer a significant difference by tackling a broader set of tasks that operate on cognitive steps, often represented in natural language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. They also act as a "glue" between tasks, allowing for their composition without human intervention, except for feedback when needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

### Agentic Workflow
The concept of an "agentic workflow" describes a situation where [[applications_of_ai_in_productivity_and_automation | AI agents]] automate and delegate not just one, but several steps in a process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

To begin building agents, organizations should first identify their workflows and understand the exact context surrounding them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. This context—including data, systems, transformations, and steps—is often only in an employee's head and not documented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

## Organizational Impact: Network of Personas
Relying solely on traditional roles and job titles is insufficient for applying [[AI in enterprise applications | AI agents]] effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Understanding the exact tools to use, planning, and conditions for behavior change requires deeper insight than job descriptions provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

A "network perspective" suggests thinking about each contributor to a workflow as a distinct "persona" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
*   **Silent Achiever**: Lower communication, high performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   **Individual Contributor**: Both communication and performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   **Connector**: Links non-adjacent teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
*   **Multiplier**: Enhances the work of other team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Knowledge Hub**: Provides domain expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

Defining these personas helps project how [[AI in Workplaces | AI agents]] might impact workflows and specific employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. For example:
*   A "silent achiever" with a coding assistant might become so productive they can handle work previously done by multiple people or steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
*   An agent can magnify a "multiplier" persona's impact across all team members, not just adjacent ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.
*   "Knowledge hub" personas might be most prone to substitution by an [[AI in enterprise applications | AI agent]] that dynamically supports the entire team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

This approach allows for identifying repeating patterns across workflows, leading to optimized agent development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.

### Emerging Patterns and New Roles
[[Impact of AI on development workflow | AI]] will lead to shifts in task execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>:
*   **Human Tasks**: Ambiguous workflows where outcomes depend heavily on the situation, or where subjectivity is desired, are better executed by humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.
*   **AI Agent Tasks**: Repetitive, tedious tasks that require perfect, consistent performance are ideal for [[applications_of_ai_in_productivity_and_automation | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.

Emerging patterns include:
*   **Commoditization of Intelligence and Domain Knowledge**: These become cheap and easily available, no longer a unique edge for employees or companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.
*   **Shift to Multi-disciplinary Know-How or Deep Specialization**: Employees and companies will need to pivot to gain new advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.
*   **AI as Super Connectors**: Agents can facilitate communication and impact across teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>.
*   **Increased Value of Context Understanding**: This will gain more value than intelligence or domain expertise alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.
*   **AI Supercharges Doers**: Individuals who perform tasks can do even more and quicker, potentially becoming "100 times engineers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.
*   **Polarization of Positions**: Less "middle ground," with a push towards new specializations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>.

New roles are expected to appear in AI-mature organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>:
*   Workflow Minor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>
*   Human-AI Orchestrator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>

### Democratizing AI Agents
To enable organizational adoption of [[AI in Workplaces | AI]], a step-by-step approach is crucial for democratization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>:
1.  **Access to general assistants**: Already common in many companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.
2.  **Individual assistants per employee**: With memory, adjustments, context understanding, and personal databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>.
3.  **Employee-built agents**: The key skill will be employees building agents on the spot using coding assistants, no-code, or low-code tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. This requires cognitive self-awareness to translate mental steps into specific, automatable actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>.
4.  **Digital Twins**: Agents representing employees, retaining organizational knowledge, allowing "time travel" to reconstruct past expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.
5.  **Agents for multiple employees**: Serving entire teams or workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>.
6.  **Swarm of agents**: Already becoming a reality with maturing LLM and [[AI in enterprise applications | AI agent]] software stacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.

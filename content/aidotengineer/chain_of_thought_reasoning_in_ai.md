Manish Sanwal, Director of AI at News Corp, focuses on AI reasoning, explainability, and automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. His work aims to build AI that is not only smarter but also more structured and self-correcting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This is achieved using [[layered_chain_of_thought_for_robust_ai | Layered Chain of Thought]] with multi-agentic systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

### Multi-Agentic Systems
Multi-agentic systems are collections of specialized AI agents that collaborate to tackle complex tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Each agent is designed to handle a specific part of an overall problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, moving away from massive monolithic systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

An example is a self-driving car system, which can be pictured as a team of specialized agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. One agent detects pedestrians, another reads traffic signals, and a third checks for the best route <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. When each agent performs its part in harmony, the entire system becomes more robust and efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

#### Advantages of the Modular Approach
The modular approach of multi-agentic systems offers several benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>:
*   **Specialization** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>: Each agent can be finely tuned for a specific task, leading to better accuracy and performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Flexibility and Scalability** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>: Individual agents can be updated or improved without overhauling the entire system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Fault Tolerance** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>: If one agent encounters an issue, others can often compensate, ensuring the overall system remains reliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

By integrating well-coordinated agents, a system that is inherently more robust and effective is created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. When [[chain_of_thought_prompting | Chain of Thought]] reasoning is added, each agent not only performs its task but also explains its decision-making process step by step, enhancing both transparency and resiliency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### Chain of Thought (CoT) Reasoning
[[chain_of_thought_prompting | Chain of Thought]] is a method that guides AI to think through a problem step by step, rather than simply guessing answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Traditionally, large language models (LLMs) are given a detailed prompt and asked for a final answer, often jumping directly to a conclusion without revealing their reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

The essence of [[chain_of_thought_prompting | Chain of Thought prompting]] is to ask the model to outline every step of its reasoning process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. By breaking down a complex problem into a series of manageable steps, the model demonstrates how it processes information and exposes its path to the conclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

#### Benefits of CoT
This approach offers two key benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>:
*   **Transparency** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>: Users can see each stage of the reasoning process, which helps understand how the model is approaching the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Opportunity for Fine-tuning and Debugging** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>: If a mistake is spotted in any intermediate step, the prompt or process can be adjusted to correct errors before the final answer is provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

In short, [[chain_of_thought_prompting | Chain of Thought]] transforms the AI's internal reasoning into a visible and verifiable sequence, making the entire process more interpretable and robust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

#### Limitations of CoT
Despite its benefits, [[chain_of_thought_prompting | Chain of Thought]] has several limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>:
*   **Prompt Sensitivity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>: The process is highly sensitive to how prompts are phrased; slight changes in wording or context can lead to vastly different outputs, complicating reproducibility and reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   **Lack of Real-time Feedback** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>: There is no built-in mechanism to verify or correct mistakes during the step-by-step reasoning process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. This means no error correction opportunity occurs until after the inference is complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   **Cascade of Errors** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>: Each step is produced without continuous validation. If an early inference is flawed, it can cause a cascade of errors compromising the integrity of the entire process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. The model relies on initial assumptions, with the only correction opportunity being after the inference is complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   **Missing Critical Connections** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>: When faced with problems involving multiple interdependent factors, [[chain_of_thought_prompting | Chain of Thought]] can sometimes miss critical connections, resulting in oversimplified or incomplete conclusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

### Layered Chain of Thought (LCoT) Prompting
[[layered_chain_of_thought_for_robust_ai | Layered Chain of Thought prompting]] (LCoT) is an approach designed to overcome the limitations of standard [[chain_of_thought_prompting | Chain of Thought]] methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. It integrates a verification step at every stage of the reasoning process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

#### How LCoT Works
The process works in two steps:
1.  **Generation of Initial Thought** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>: An AI agent begins by producing an initial thought, which is the first piece of reasoning generated from the input prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. This serves as the starting point for further reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
2.  **Verification Against the Knowledge Base** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>: Before moving on, the generated thought is immediately verified by cross-referencing the output against a structured knowledge base or an external database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. This verification can involve fact-checking algorithms, consistency checks through contextual reasoning, or an ensemble model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. This crucial step ensures that only accurate and reliable information influences subsequent reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

This iterative process repeatedly generates a new thought, verifies it, and then processes it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. The chain of reasoning is built step by step, with each link confirmed before the next one is added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

#### Benefits of LCoT
The additional verification step in [[layered_chain_of_thought_for_robust_ai | Layered Chain of Thought]] offers significant benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>:
*   **Self-Correction** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>: Verification at each step allows the system to catch and correct errors early, preventing mistakes from propagating through the entire reasoning chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   **Robustness Against Prompt Variability** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>: Because each step is independently verified, the overall process becomes less sensitive to small changes in the input, leading to higher reproducibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
*   **Trustworthiness** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>: Each verified step ensures that the final output is built on accurate and validated information, resulting in more trustworthy conclusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Transparency** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>: Breaking down reasoning into discrete, verifiable steps makes the AI thought process much more transparent, allowing for easier auditing and interpretation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

In essence, [[layered_chain_of_thought_for_robust_ai | Layered Chain of Thought]] transforms AI reasoning into a robust iterative framework where every step is checked for accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. This not only mitigates the inherent weaknesses of traditional [[chain_of_thought_prompting | Chain of Thought]] but also leads to more reliable, reproducible, and interpretable AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

### Integration with Multi-Agentic Systems
[[layered_chain_of_thought_for_robust_ai | Layered Chain of Thought prompting]] can be seamlessly implemented using existing Large Language Model (LLM) tools and integrates perfectly within multi-agentic systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. In such systems, each specialized agent contributes to a robust overall system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Overall, [[layered_chain_of_thought_for_robust_ai | Layered Chain of Thought]] enhances both accuracy and reproducibility by ensuring every inference is validated before proceeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

The future of AI is not just about building bigger models, but about creating systems that are structured, explainable, and reliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. By prioritizing transparency, self-correction, collaboration, and validation, the foundation for truly trustworthy AI is laid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. A paper on [[layered_chain_of_thought_for_robust_ai | Layered Chain of Thought prompting]] has been published and is available for review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

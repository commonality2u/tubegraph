This article explores the evolution of AI, drawing on personal experiences from the mid-2010s to present-day advancements in AI agents and development methodologies at Sierra, a conversational AI platform for businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Sierra, initially known for chat and customer service, is expanding into phone interactions and broader customer experience touchpoints, including sales, subscription management, and product recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## The Early Days: AI "Caves" (2010s)

The speaker reflects on the "ancient history" of AI, noting that many discussions about AI's past often only go back to 2019 or 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. However, he emphasizes that 2016 felt like the "AI caves" despite AI's origins in the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### Computer Vision Challenges (2016)
In 2016, working at Google with computer vision engineers, the primary challenge was helping computers differentiate between seemingly similar objects, such as a Chihuahua and a blueberry muffin, dogs and bagels, or dogs and fried chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. This work was the initial phase of building Google Lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

At this time, one of the few consumer applications where computer vision models showed promise was identifying plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Testing these early models felt like a "slot machine" due to the non-determinism of inputs or outputs, a common experience for those building with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

### Google Brain and Early Large Models (2012)
Rewinding further to 2012, an earlier "AI caves" period, a significant breakthrough occurred when Google Brain was able to watch cat videos and identify them on YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. This model, with approximately a billion parameters, was considered enormous at the time, especially when compared to today's frontier models that have about a trillion parameters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

## Modern AI and the Agent Development Life Cycle

Today, Google Lens has vastly improved, allowing users to search, shop, translate non-Latin character sets, and even solve math homework using visual input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. This progress is attributed to consistent, step-by-step iteration over a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

### The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Parallel
The continuous improvement seen in [[evolution_of_ai_engineering_and_tools | AI engineering]] mirrors the established Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), which emphasizes iterative processes like implementation, testing, maintenance, analysis, and design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

### The Agent Development Life Cycle (ADLC) at Sierra
Sierra has adapted these principles to create the "Agent Development Life Cycle" (ADLC) for building and improving [[importance_and_progress_of_ai_agents | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. This is critical because building with large language models (LLMs) is like building on a "foundation of jello" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

Key distinctions between traditional software and LLMs:
*   **Traditional Software**: Deterministic, fast, cheap, rigid, governed by if statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.
*   **LLMs**: Non-deterministic, slow, expensive to run, flexible, creative, capable of reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

The ADLC aims to leverage LLM strengths while integrating traditional software where beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

#### Practical Application of ADLC: Chubbies
Sierra partnered with Chubbies to create an [[importance_and_progress_of_ai_agents | AI agent]] named Duncan Smothers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Duncan is highly capable and personable, assisting customers with sizing and fit, inventory tracking, and package tracking and refunds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. This demonstrates "autonomous agents" that take action, not just answer questions, leading to more customers being helped quickly and with higher satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

Sierra treats "every agent as a product," requiring a fully featured developer and customer experience operations platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. They have dedicated agent engineering and product management teams working directly with customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

#### Continuous Improvement and QA in ADLC
The ADLC emphasizes continuous improvement. If Duncan Smothers makes a mistake, such as providing incorrect inventory, an issue is filed, a test is created, and once the test passes, a new release is made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. Over time, a Sierra agent can go from a handful of tests at launch to hundreds and thousands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. Furthermore, agents can be designed to go "above and beyond," such as having a budget to delight customers with unexpected services like DoorDashing shorts from a retail location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

A year prior, this entire process was manual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. Now, [[advancements_in_ai_and_future_implications | AI]] is being integrated into each part of the ADLC to speed up improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. The ADLC becomes even more effective for larger customers, where velocity and change management are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. Changes also stem from external factors like model upgrades, new paradigms (e.g., reasoning models), and multimodality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. Reasoning models act as a "force multiplier," making the application of AI more effective across development, testing, and QA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

### [[the_evolution_of_ai_interfaces_and_user_interaction | Evolution of AI Interfaces]]: Voice Agents
Sierra launched voice capabilities in October, benefiting large customers like SiriusXM, who can now answer customer calls immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. Sierra's approach to voice is akin to responsive web design: it's the same underlying platform and agent code, but it adapts to the channel and modality of interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. Customization for phrasing and parallelizing requests for lower latency are still possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.

## The Nature of Large Language Models (LLMs)

Building with [[evolution_and_limitations_of_ai_models | LLMs]] is fascinating because they remind us of ourselves: they are unpredictable, slow, and not great at math <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. However, this unpredictability allows for a unique form of empathy in design, enabling creators to put themselves in the "shoes of the robot" and build better experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.

When building voice agents, a key question is how robust they are if only given transcribed text with delay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. Sierra aims to build robust and rich experiences by giving LLMs the same inputs and experiences that humans have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.

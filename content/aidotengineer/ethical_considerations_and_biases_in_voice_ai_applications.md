The rapid development of generative AI and voice AI applications necessitates a strong focus on [[ethics_and_societal_impact_of_ai | ethical considerations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. With the ease of building Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) for these applications, [[the_role_and_skills_of_a_voice_ai_engineer | AI engineers]] and leaders bear the primary responsibility for addressing potential issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

## Potential for Bias and Spooky Realism
Voice AI applications inherently carry the risk of bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. Specifically, voice AI apps could be:
*   **Biased against certain demographics** particularly individuals with specific accents or dialects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   **"Spooky" when overly realistic** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. While advanced text-to-speech models offer low latency and high realism, they can sometimes produce "audio hallucinations" or say "weird things" when attempting to sound too real, which can be unsettling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. This emphasizes a preference for reliability over extreme realism in production applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

## The Onus on AI Engineers
In regions like the US, a lack of AI regulation places the responsibility squarely on [[the_role_and_skills_of_a_voice_ai_engineer | AI engineers]] and industry leaders to proactively consider and address these ethical problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. Given that voice AI represents a new form of interaction with artificial intelligence, the approach to its development is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

## Guidelines for Responsible Development
When making tooling and infrastructure choices, [[the_role_and_skills_of_a_voice_ai_engineer | AI engineers]] should prioritize principles that ensure AI development is:
*   **Accessible** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   **Collaborative** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
*   **Beneficial for everyone** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

A key part of achieving this is by selecting tools and infrastructure that allow a diverse range of stakeholders to be involved in the development process from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. Additionally, when new models emerge, the ability to quickly and safely integrate them is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>.

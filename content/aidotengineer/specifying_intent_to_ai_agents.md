The second pattern of AI-native development involves a shift from focusing on implementation details to [[role_of_ai_agents_in_planning_and_executing_tasks | specifying intent]] to AI agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. This means communicating "what we want" and allowing the agents to "figure it out" and execute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

## Methods of Specifying Intent

*   **Simple Markdown Files**: An early approach involved using a basic Markdown file as a specification, which was then added to the prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. This method helped in building shared functionality, whether functional or technical, as a clear specification, reducing the need to repeatedly rewrite details in the prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

## Evolution to Intent-Based Coding

Once the desired outcome is defined, AI can assist in creating a plan to achieve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. This has led to the emergence of "intent-based coding" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

Rather than relying on chat or text completion, this approach involves:
1.  Defining tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
2.  Allowing these tasks to serve as the specification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
3.  The AI building a plan based on the specification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
4.  The AI then generating the necessary code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

This represents a significant new direction for development tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

## Specification-Centric Workflow

The entire development toolchain can become specification-centric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. This means developers might interact less directly with the code itself, instead focusing on specifying functional, technical, and security requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. The workflow revolves around these specifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

Ultimately, this shifts the role to managing the development process like a program manager, rather than focusing on the minute details of the coding process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. This pattern complements the first pattern of shifting from producer to manager of AI-generated code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

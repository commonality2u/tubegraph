The **Model Context Protocol (mCP)** was developed by Anthropic's applied AI team with the core concept that models are only as effective as the context provided to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. Initially, context was manually provided through copy-pasting or typing into chatbots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. However, systems have evolved to allow models to directly access user data and context, making them more powerful and personalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. [[Model Context Protocol mCP | mCP]] emerged as an open protocol to enable seamless [[integration_of_mcp_with_ai_applications | integration of mCP with AI applications]] and agents with various tools and data sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

## Standardization Efforts

[[Model Context Protocol mCP | mCP]] builds upon the principles of prior standardization protocols:
*   **APIs** standardized web app interaction between front-end and back-end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.
*   **LSP (Language Server Protocol)** standardized how IDEs interact with language-specific tools, serving as a significant inspiration for [[Model Context Protocol mCP | mCP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

[[Model Context Protocol mCP | mCP]] standardizes how AI applications interact with external systems through three primary interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>:
*   **Prompts:** User-controlled, predefined templates for common interactions with a server <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. These can be dynamic and interpolated with user or application context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.
*   **Tools:** Model-controlled functions that the model within the client application can choose to invoke, such as reading or writing data to databases, CRMs like Salesforce, or local systems like Git <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.
*   **Resources:** Application-controlled data exposed to the application, such as images, text files, or JSON, providing a rich interface for applications and servers to interact beyond text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. Resources can also be dynamic and support notifications when updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.

Before [[Model Context Protocol mCP | mCP]], there was significant fragmentation in how AI systems were built, with each team creating custom implementations for prompt logic, tool integration, and data access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. [[Model Context Protocol mCP | mCP]] aims to standardize AI [[development_and_adoption_of_mcp | development and adoption of MCP]], allowing any [[Model Context Protocol mCP | mCP]] client to connect to any [[Model Context Protocol mCP | mCP]] server with zero additional work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.

### Value Proposition of Standardization
*   **Application Developers:** Once an application is [[Model Context Protocol mCP | mCP]] compatible, it can connect to any server without extra development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.
*   **Tool/API Providers:** Build an [[Model Context Protocol mCP | mCP]] server once and see it adopted across various AI applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.
*   **End-Users:** Access to more powerful and context-rich AI applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>.
*   **Enterprises:** Clear separation of concerns between teams, with one team owning the infrastructure (e.g., vector DB) as an [[Model Context Protocol mCP | mCP]] server, enabling other teams to build AI applications faster without needing direct access to the underlying data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>. This mirrors the benefits seen with microservices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>.

## Adoption and Future Outlook

The [[development_and_adoption_of_mcp | adoption of mCP]] has seen significant growth in recent months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>:
*   **Applications and IDEs:** Provides a way for users coding in IDEs to provide context to agents, which then interact with external systems like GitHub or documentation sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>.
*   **Server Side:** Over 1100 community-built servers have been published open source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>. Companies like Cloudflare and Stripe have published official [[integration_of_mcp_with_ai_applications | integrations of mCP with AI applications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:30">[50:30]</a>.
*   **Open Source:** Significant contributions to the core protocol and its infrastructure layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>.

[[Model Context Protocol mCP | mCP]] is envisioned as a foundational protocol for agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:36:00">[26:36:00]</a>. It enables [[mCPs Role in Augmented LLM Systems | augmented LLM systems]] to query and write data to various systems, invoke tools, and maintain state, moving beyond a "fresh start" for every interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:38:00">[27:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:10:00">[28:10:00]</a>. This allows agents to expand their capabilities even after initialization by discovering new interactions with the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:41:00">[28:41:00]</a>.

### Key Capabilities for Agent Adoption
*   **Sampling:** Allows an [[Model Context Protocol mCP | mCP]] server to request LLM inference calls from the client, enabling the server to access intelligence without hosting its own LLM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:49:00">[53:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:50:00">[54:50:00]</a>. The client retains control over privacy, cost, and model preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:34:00">[55:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:51:00">[55:51:00]</a>.
*   **Composability:** Any application, API, or agent can act as both an [[Model Context Protocol mCP | mCP]] client and an [[Model Context Protocol mCP | mCP]] server, enabling complex, layered architectures where agents can chain interactions and specialize in particular tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:19:00">[56:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:28:00">[57:28:00]</a>.

### Roadmap for Further Adoption
*   **Remote Servers and OAuth 2.0:** Support for remotely hosted servers via SSE (Server-Sent Events) and OAuth 2.0 authentication will remove development friction and make servers more discoverable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:28">[01:13:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:05">[01:15:05]</a>.
*   **Official [[Model Context Protocol mCP | mCP]] Registry API:** A unified, hosted metadata service (built in the open) will address [[fragmentation_and_installation_issues_of_mcps | fragmentation and installation issues of mCPs]] by providing a centralized way to discover, verify, and manage [[Model Context Protocol mCP | mCP]] servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:30">[01:22:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:09">[01:23:09]</a>. This will also support versioning of server capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:05">[01:24:05]</a>. This allows agents to be self-evolving, dynamically discovering new capabilities and data on the fly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:01">[01:36:01]</a>.
*   **Well-Known [[Model Context Protocol mCP | mCP]] Files:** A standardized way for domains (e.g., shopify.com) to provide a `.`well-known/mcp.json file, allowing agents to discover and utilize specific tools and resources from that domain, complementing the registry's discoverability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:27">[01:39:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:07">[01:40:07]</a>. This can coexist with computer use models, enabling agents to use APIs where available and UI interaction for the longtail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:52">[01:40:52]</a>.
*   **Medium-Term Considerations:** The roadmap includes addressing stateful vs. stateless connections, streaming data, improved name spacing to prevent tool conflicts, and enhancing proactive server behavior (server-initiated actions and notifications) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:31">[01:41:31]</a>.

Overall, [[Model Context Protocol mCP | mCP]] aims to [[reducing_complexity_of_creative_tools_with_mcp | reduce complexity of creative tools with mCP]] by standardizing how AI applications and agents connect to external systems, fostering a robust ecosystem of reusable components and accelerating [[development_and_adoption_of_mcp | development and adoption of MCP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>.

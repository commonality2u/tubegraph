## Smithery's Role in Solving [[Challenges in the MCP ecosystem | Model Context Protocol Challenges]]

Smithery, founded by Henry, aims to address significant [[Challenges in the MCP ecosystem | problems within the Model Context Protocol (MCP) space and ecosystem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Henry, who is also a member of the [[Model context protocol MCP | MCP]] committee, launched Smithery in December 2024 to tackle these emerging issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

### The Genesis of Smithery

The founding of Smithery stems from the observation of "Claude's Paradox" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Despite the significant intelligence developed by frontier labs, this intelligence often remains "stuck in a box" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. To make AI agents practically useful, there's a need to consider context and capability â€“ what inputs and outputs models require <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

This problem was recognized by major labs, leading Anthropic to release the [[Model context protocol MCP | Model Context Protocol]] (MCP) in November 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The [[Model context protocol MCP | MCP]] was designed as an open standard to help LLMs connect to various services, promising to standardize the "n times n problem" of connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. While the emergence of [[Model context protocol MCP | MCPs]] and a vibrant developer community was exciting, it also brought a new set of challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### Addressing [[Challenges in the MCP ecosystem | MCP Ecosystem Challenges]]

Smithery aims to become an "AI gateway" that can grow and orchestrate the new era of AI-native services for AI agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. It addresses [[Challenges in the MCP ecosystem | problems in the MCP ecosystem]] for both users and developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

#### For MCP Users:

*   **[[Fragmentation and installation issues of MCPs | Fragmentation]]**: The increasing number of [[Model context protocol MCP | MCP]] servers makes it difficult to find high-quality ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Smithery plans to curate thousands of [[Model context protocol MCP | MCPs]] to address this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   **[[Fragmentation and installation issues of MCPs | High Friction Install]]**: The typical five-step installation process for [[Model context protocol MCP | MCPs]] on GitHub is cumbersome, and insecure [[Model context protocol MCP | MCPs]] can be installed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **AI Native Economy**: There is no clear plan for creating an economy of AI-native services or handling agentic payments, raising questions about how agents will pay on behalf of users or how to avoid numerous small subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

#### For MCP Developers:

*   **[[Problems faced by MCP developers | Hosting Problems]]**: While Streambo HTTP transport has made hosting easier, developers still face issues with stable sessions and resumability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   **[[Problems faced by MCP developers | Lacking Developer Tooling]]**: Current tools are basic, leaving developers with questions about designing the best [[Model context protocol MCP | MCPs]], ensuring their tools are called, and creating optimal agent experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **[[Problems faced by MCP developers | Distribution]]**: Developers lack clear pathways for their [[Model context protocol MCP | MCPs]] to be discovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **[[Problems faced by MCP developers | Observability]]**: Improving [[Model context protocol MCP | MCPs]] after deployment is challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
*   **Monetization**: There is no clear strategy for developers to monetize their [[Model context protocol MCP | MCPs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

### Smithery Playground Demo

Smithery has developed a playground to showcase what an AI agent can achieve when it has access to thousands of curated [[Model context protocol MCP | MCPs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. In a demonstration, an AI agent successfully:
1.  Analyzed a prompt to find the most pressing issue on a GitHub repository <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
2.  Used a `search servers` function to find and connect to relevant [[Model context protocol MCP | MCPs]], including GitHub and Linear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
3.  Utilized the GitHub [[Model context protocol MCP | MCP]] to identify high-priority bugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
4.  Created a detailed ticket on Linear, including a link to the original issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

This end-to-end task demonstrates the potential when an AI agent can seamlessly connect to multiple [[Model context protocol MCP | MCPs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

### Future Vision

Henry believes that the future of the internet will be dominated by "tool calls" rather than clicks, where the "agent experience" will supersede the user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. This future will be built collaboratively by the entire developer community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

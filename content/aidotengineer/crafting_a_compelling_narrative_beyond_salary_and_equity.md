In today's competitive talent market, particularly within the AI space, companies must develop a compelling narrative that extends beyond traditional compensation like salary and equity. While these factors were historically central to recruitment, their singular reliance is no longer sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>.

## The Evolving Landscape of Compensation

The average tech salary increased by only 1.6% between November 2022 and November 2024, accompanied by a significant decline in the amount of equity granted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>. For [[building_and_recruiting_ai_teams | AI engineers]], the situation is even more challenging, as they command a 5% salary premium and a 10-20% equity premium over other engineering roles, making an already expensive talent pool even pricier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.

Furthermore, relying on equity as a primary draw has become less effective. In Q2 2024, only 33% of individuals exercised their vested shares, a notable drop from 55% just a couple of years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>. This decline is attributed to concerns over potentially high valuations, the cost of liquid capital needed to exercise shares, and the rapid, often volatile, shifts in the AI market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>.

> "Salary as a sole selling point has got to go. Equity can't be the only other thing that we're relying on." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>

## Beyond Financial Incentives: Building a Holistic Narrative

To attract top talent, companies must understand their own "arc" â€“ their triumphs, current position, and future direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. This involves constructing a narrative that highlights non-monetary advantages and intrinsic motivators.

### Key Elements of a Strong Company Narrative:

*   **Culture and Environment:** Offer a close-knit environment and opportunities to work directly with founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>. Emphasize collaborative teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>.
*   **Efficiency and Impact:** Showcase a culture of speed and a lack of friction in getting work done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.
*   **Mission and Purpose:** Articulate a compelling, big mission that resonates with potential hires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>.
*   **Growth and Development:** Provide opportunities for personal and professional growth, including career advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.
*   **Market Opportunity:** Highlight the excitement and potential of "exploding" markets your company operates within <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.
*   **Problem Solving:** Emphasize the chance to engage in and solve complex problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>.

Understanding and clearly communicating these aspects for your company is crucial to avoid an over-reliance on salary and equity in your recruitment narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>.

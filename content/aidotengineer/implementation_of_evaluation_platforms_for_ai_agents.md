The primary challenge in developing AI agent swarms capable of solving complex knowledge work problems is their inherent instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This instability stems from difficulties in observing them perfectly, the dynamic environments they operate in, and the challenges of [[testing_and_evaluation_of_ai_models | testing them comprehensively]] beforehand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. It's often unclear if agents are consistently making progress towards a goal when they don't achieve it in a single attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## The Role of [[evaluating_ai_agents_and_assistants | Evaluations]]

A robust approach to stabilizing AI agents involves systematic [[evaluating_ai_agents_and_assistants | evaluations]], or "evals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Simply adopting an eval stack without systematic usage is unlikely to yield significant improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. For evaluations to be effective, they must continuously improve agents and workflows, while the evaluation stacks themselves must evolve to align with business requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

### [[challenges_in_ai_agent_evaluation | Challenges in Evaluation]]

[[evaluating_ai_agents_and_assistants | Evaluating]] all aspects of agent behaviors and internal representations presents a complex landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Evaluations can cover two main areas:
*   **Agent's Representation of Reality**: How the agent models, discusses, and grounds reality (what is true) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Behavioral Aspects**: Whether the agent infers the correct goals, makes progress towards them, and selects appropriate tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

While ideally all these aspects would be evaluated, starting with some consistent evaluation is a viable approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

### Evaluation Frameworks

To begin, a clear framework for setting up [[role_of_evaluators_in_ai | evaluators]] is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. For instance, a hotel reservation agent might require [[role_of_evaluators_in_ai | evaluators]] for:
*   Policy adherence (e.g., specific hotel reservation policy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>
*   Accuracy of outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>
*   Overall appropriate behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>

An effective evaluation platform must offer good visibility for creating large stacks of [[role_of_evaluators_in_ai | evaluators]] and systematically maintaining and improving them over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

## The Stabilization Loop with Model Conduct Protocol (MCP)

The goal is to achieve a stabilization loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. In this loop:
1.  An agent attempts a task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
2.  The task's output is [[evaluating_ai_agents_and_assistants | evaluated]] by an evaluation engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
3.  Feedback, in the form of a numeric score and an explanation of what went right or wrong, is returned to the agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
4.  The agent uses this information to [[evaluating_and_optimizing_ai_agents_and_workflows | improve its own performance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

This [[evaluation_and_feedback_in_ai_systems | feedback]] mechanism needs to originate from the engine. The Model Conduct Protocol (MCP) is a method for attaching agents to this [[evaluation_and_feedback_in_ai_systems | feedback]] loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

## Practical Application of MCP

### Example 1: Optimizing a Marketing Message

Even without code, MCP can be used to evaluate and improve text output from an agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. For instance, to optimize a marketing message like "routing MCP service awesome let you access nicely" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>:
*   A user can query available "charges" (collections of [[role_of_evaluators_in_ai | evaluators]]) or [[role_of_evaluators_in_ai | evaluators]] directly via the MCP interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   Once a relevant "charge" (e.g., "marketing message quality judge") is identified, the system can be instructed to optimize the message using that charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   The MCP interface scores the original message and then attempts to improve the score, suggesting an optimized version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
*   Scores for metrics like persuasiveness, writing quality, and engagingness are provided, typically on a scale of zero to one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
*   Agents can either be explicitly told which [[role_of_evaluators_in_ai | evaluators]] to run or allowed to pick them themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

### Example 2: Stabilizing a Hotel Reservation Agent

Consider a simple hotel reservation agent for "Shire Hotel" that should avoid mentioning a competitor, "Akma Hotel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Without MCP**: If the MCP is off, the agent might politely offer rooms but also recommend "Akma Hotel" as a "great option," which is undesirable behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.
*   **With MCP**: By enabling the MCP server for evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>, the agent can invoke specific [[role_of_evaluators_in_ai | evaluators]] like a "hotel SH booking policy evaluator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. This causes the agent to stop recommending the competitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. The agent can pick relevant [[role_of_evaluators_in_ai | evaluators]] automatically, or specific ones can be enforced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

This demonstrates how an agent, attached to an evaluation engine via MCP, receives [[evaluation_and_feedback_in_ai_systems | feedback]] to [[evaluating_and_optimizing_ai_agents_and_workflows | improve its own behavior]], an approach that can scale to more complex scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

## [[best_practices_for_ai_evaluation | Best Practices for Implementation]]

To effectively implement evaluation platforms for AI agents:
1.  **Powerful Evaluation Library**: Ensure your evaluation library or platform is sufficiently powerful, supporting a diversity of [[role_of_evaluators_in_ai | evaluators]] and their life cycle maintenance and optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. This allows for both agent optimization and the optimization of [[role_of_evaluators_in_ai | evaluators]] themselves, which can be numerous and costly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.
2.  **Manual Offline MCP**: Start by running the MCP manually offline (as with the marketing message example) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. This helps understand the process and gain transparency into how [[role_of_evaluators_in_ai | evaluators]] function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.
3.  **Attach via MCP**: Finally, attach the [[role_of_evaluators_in_ai | evaluators]] to the agents through the MCP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. This promises to make agent behavior more controllable, transparent, dynamically self-improving, and self-correcting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

The Root Signals MCP server is available for free, and more evaluation platforms and frameworks are expected to emerge to integrate with agent stacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.

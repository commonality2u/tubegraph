The current landscape of AI in products often sees companies rapidly adding chatbots, which, while an easy solution, may not always be truly helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Arthur, a product designer at Evil Marti, challenges this approach, advocating for a different perspective on how AI can be integrated into products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Challenging the Status Quo: Beyond Reactive Chatbots

Inspired by the concept behind Clippy—which had the right idea but terrible execution and timing—modern technology now allows for the proper implementation of proactive AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Instead of AI assistants waiting to be asked, the focus shifts to an [[proactive_ai_versus_reactive_ai | AI that anticipates user needs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

The development of Tigon, an AI issue tracker, exemplifies this approach by doing the complete opposite of simply slapping on a chat interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This proactive AI guides users seamlessly, helping them create better work without breaking their flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

### Types of Proactive AI Assistance in Tigon

Proactive AI in Tigon operates within the natural flow of work, eliminating the need for context switching, extra windows, or chat interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Users retain control, with changes easily reversible with a single click <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

*   **Suggestion Mode**
    This mode tracks user input in real-time, understands the context, and intervenes at the precise moment with specific, contextual questions that advance the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. For example, if a user reports a "legality share," the AI immediately asks relevant, non-generic questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   **Action Mode**
    When the AI detects complexity, such as an issue that can be divided into sub-issues, it immediately suggests a more organized approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This AI leverages historical data and a general understanding of best practices to identify and propose sub-issues, demonstrating true comprehension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. It can even consider timelines and resources, much like an attentive project manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   **Question Plus Action Mode**
    This combines the proactive questioning and action-oriented suggestions within the existing workflow, helping users better manage issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Core Principles for Fostering Proactive AI

To cultivate [[proactive_ai_versus_reactive_ai | proactive AI]] in products, three simple rules are followed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>:

1.  **AI should supplement user agency, not replace it** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
2.  **AI should offer recommendations, never force them** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
3.  **AI should be part of the natural workflow, not stop it** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

## Applications of Proactive AI Across Professional Tools

This proactive pattern can be incredibly powerful across various professional tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>:

*   **Code Editors**: AI can proactively monitor for common pitfalls and suggest improvements, particularly beneficial for developers learning new languages or frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   **Design Tools**: Imagine a tool that suggests accessible design improvements as you work, eliminating the need for post-design checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **Communication Tools**: AI could prepare relevant context before meetings or find documents mentioned during a call, acting as an adviser while the user retains control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

## How to Start Thinking About Proactive AI for Your Products

To begin developing proactive AI for your own products, consider the following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>:

1.  **Look for Friction Points**: Identify where users typically stop their work to ask for help; these are prime opportunities for proactive assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
2.  **Identify User Behavior Patterns**: Observe where users consistently need help or what questions they frequently ask; these patterns are clues for automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
3.  **Think About Context**: Determine where users commonly get stuck, as this is where AI can provide the most significant help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

## Conclusion

[[effective_design_of_ai_in_products | AI interface design]] is still in its nascent stages, meaning there isn't a fully formed playbook of [[best_practices_for_building_ai_systems | best practices]] yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Simply copying and pasting chat interfaces is not the answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Therefore, it is crucial to embrace experimentation in products, challenge the status quo, and propose unexpected UI solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

Bar Yaron, a partner at Amplify, focuses their investments on data and [[AI in enterprise applications | AI]] companies, specifically targeting technical founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This focus highlights the significant area of venture capital interest in the evolving fields of data and artificial intelligence.

## Influential Figures and Trends in AI

During a survey conducted among 100 [[State of AI Engineering | AI Engineers]], several influential figures in the [[AI industry trends and challenges | AI]] research space were identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>:
*   Jeff Hinton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>
*   Yan LeCun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>
*   Andrew Ng <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>
*   Fei-Fei Li <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>
*   Yoshua Bengio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>

Sam Altman, while influential, was not among the top eight most influential [[AI in Workplaces | AI]] researchers according to the survey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

## Considerations for Choosing AI Models

When [[Enterprise AI and ROI challenges | AI engineers]] choose an [[AI in enterprise applications | AI]] model, the top consideration, surprisingly to some, is **cost** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. Other important factors include:
*   Latency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>
*   Accuracy/Performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>
*   Open-source versus Closed-source options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>
*   Capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>

## Industry Buzzwords and Challenges

Some buzzwords that [[AI in Workplaces | AI engineers]] are reportedly tired of hearing include "AGI" (Artificial General Intelligence) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>, "RAG" (Retrieval Augmented Generation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>, and "Prompt Engineering" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.

### Hot Takes on AI Development

Industry experts offered several "hot takes" on the future of [[AI technological advancements | AI]] and its development:
*   At least one of the major entities currently training large [[AI in enterprise applications | AI]] models may no longer be doing so by the end of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   [[AI in Workplaces | AI]] could serve as effective therapists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   A significant trend will see the majority of deployed [[AI in enterprise applications | AI]] models running **on-device** within a year and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. This points towards smaller, more specialized models orchestrated together, reducing reliance on larger models and external data processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. This could impact [[Costeffective AI strategies | cost-effective AI strategies]] and [[AI in IT infrastructure management | IT infrastructure management]].
*   AI could facilitate future dating apps, with [[AI in enterprise applications | AIs]] dating each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   Transformers may not be the final [[AI technological advancements | AI]] architecture, with the potential for models to be built using biological materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
*   Future [[AI in Workplaces | AI]] conversations are predicted to involve multiple bots in a room rather than just one-on-one interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

## Jobs at Risk and Industry Benefits

When asked about jobs most at risk of [[AI disruption]], survey respondents identified:
*   Data entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>
*   Content creation/writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>
*   Software engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>

The industry expected to benefit most from [[AI in enterprise applications | AI]] is healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>, indicating potential for significant [[efficiency improvements with AI in financial analysis | efficiency improvements with AI]].

## Key AI Papers and Tools

The most influential [[AI in enterprise applications | AI]] paper in history, according to the surveyed engineers, is "Attention Is All You Need" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>.
A popular [[AI in Workplaces | AI]] tool among engineers is Cursor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.

## The [[State of AI Engineering | State of AI Engineering]] Survey

A broader survey on the [[State of AI Engineering | State of AI Engineering]] is being conducted, aiming to provide transparency within the industry regarding tools and workflows used by [[AI in Workplaces | AI Engineers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>.

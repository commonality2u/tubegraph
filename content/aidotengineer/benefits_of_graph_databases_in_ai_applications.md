Many organizations are exploring the potential of [[use_of_knowledge_graphs_in_generative_ai | Generative AI]], yet a significant challenge lies in achieving practical, production-ready applications. Gartner predicted that 30% of [[use_of_knowledge_graphs_in_generative_ai | generative AI]] projects would be abandoned by the end of 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. A primary reason for this failure rate is the lack of a clear business use case that solves real problems and is monetizable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This article explores how graph databases provide a powerful solution for these challenges, particularly in enhancing [[evolution_of_ai_models_and_their_application | AI]] applications like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

## Real-World Application: BioPharma Technology Transfer

One compelling business case for [[use_of_knowledge_graphs_in_generative_ai | Gen AI]] is in biopharma technology transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. This process involves scaling drug development from lab bench to industrial scale, producing millions of doses daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Historically, this has taken years, requiring industrial teams to sift through hundreds of thousands of scientific documents, notes, and test outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

An additional challenge is the drastic reduction in manufacturing worker tenure, from an average of 20 years in 2019 to just three years currently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This means a significant loss of expertise as experienced workers retire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. [[use_of_knowledge_graphs_in_generative_ai | Generative AI]] is crucial to capture the intelligence from documents and tacit knowledge in people's heads, transferring it to new employees for efficient technology transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

## How Graph Databases Address These Challenges

To tackle the complexities of information transfer and knowledge retention, millions of documents are loaded into a graph database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Rather than loading entire documents, specific "chunks" of information are loaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

### Key Benefits Identified:

*   **Structured Chunking and Refinement**: Graph databases allow for structuring document chunks (e.g., document, block, paragraph, line) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. This structure enables learning and improvement in how documents are initially chunked, optimizing search results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   **Solving Critical Business Problems**: By facilitating faster technology transfer, graph-powered [[use_of_knowledge_graphs_in_generative_ai | Gen AI]] applications can accelerate the delivery of life-saving drugs, demonstrating a clear and impactful business use case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   **Accelerated Data Consolidation and Understanding**: Consolidating data in a graph significantly speeds up the process for data scientists, engineers, developers, and SREs to understand the data landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. Tasks that once took three months to consolidate, understand, and clean up can now be done in three weeks or less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. This boosts team performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Data Traversal and Performance**: Graph databases make data traversal significantly easier, improving data search efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.
*   **Richer Contextual Knowledge for [[evolution_of_ai_models_and_their_application | LLM]]s**: In complex industries with many connections, graph databases inherently store relationships that might not be explicitly joined in relational databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>. When a search is performed, the "neighborhood" of related information becomes available, providing better contextual knowledge to [[evolution_of_ai_models_and_their_application | LLM]]s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.
*   **Improved Explainability and Governance**: Unlike statistical probabilities in vector space, graph databases allow for reasoning about nodes and edges, making the relationships and answers from [[evolution_of_ai_models_and_their_application | LLM]]s more explainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. They also enable better governance through controls and properties on graph nodes, dictating access to information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>.
*   **Precise and Accurate Answers**: By providing deep contextual understanding and structured relationships, graph databases contribute to more precise and accurate answers from [[evolution_of_ai_models_and_their_application | LLM]]s, which is critical in industries where being wrong is not an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>.

## Graph RAG Architecture

The approach combines both vector and [[semantic_and_graphbased_data_in_ai_systems | knowledge graph]] representations of data for [[use_of_knowledge_graphs_in_generative_ai | Gen AI]] applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. This involves:

*   **Vector Database**: Providing relational closeness in vector space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.
*   **[[semantic_and_graphbased_data_in_ai_systems | Knowledge Graph]]**: Supplying additional context through relationally close nodes from the graph database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.

This combined approach yields more contextually relevant results from expert systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>.

In conclusion, leveraging graph databases in [[use_of_knowledge_graphs_in_generative_ai | AI]] applications, particularly with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), offers significant advantages in solving complex business challenges by providing structured, contextual, explainable, and precise information, essential for critical industries like life sciences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>.

Location remains a crucial factor in [[building_ai_teams | building AI teams]] and [[Hiring and Building Effective AI Teams | hiring AI talent]], even in a distributed world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. Data from SignalFire's proprietary AI/ML platform, Beacon, which tracks over 650 million employees and 80 million companies, offers insights into talent concentration and movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## Current State of Engineer Distribution

Contrary to some popular debates, San Francisco is not "dead" as a tech hub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.
*   San Francisco accounts for approximately 29% of all startup engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. This is slightly down from a 2013 peak of 33% but has been ticking up since 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
*   New York and Seattle have both doubled their market share of engineers over the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   For big tech companies, 50% of engineers still reside in the San Francisco Bay Area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

## AI-Specific Talent Concentration

When focusing specifically on AI engineers, the concentration in key cities becomes even more pronounced:
*   San Francisco leads, with 35% of all AI engineers residing there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   Seattle holds about 22% of AI engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   New York accounts for approximately 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
*   San Francisco alone has more AI engineers than Seattle and New York combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

These three markets (San Francisco, Seattle, and New York) are "punching well above their weight" in terms of [[ai_in_workplaces | AI hiring]] and talent, showing a much larger share of AI talent compared to their overall engineer market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. The talent is currently concentrating in these three key markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

## Funding and Talent Flow

The concentration of AI talent is also reflected in funding trends:
*   San Francisco accounts for nearly 38% of all early-stage funding into AI startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
*   This is significant considering San Francisco only accounts for 26% of all early-stage funding in the United States total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   Therefore, San Francisco is excelling in both AI talent concentration and the funding directed towards AI companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

## Key Takeaways for Hiring

When [[choosing_and_implementing_ai_models_for_data_analysis | choosing and implementing AI models]], engineers consider various factors that influence the model's suitability and performance. A survey of 100 AI Engineers revealed the top considerations in this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

## Key Considerations for Choosing an AI Model

According to a survey of 100 AI engineers, the top considerations when choosing a model include:

*   **Cost** The most frequently cited consideration is the cost associated with the model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.
*   **Latency** The speed at which the model processes information and responds is a significant factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.
*   **Accuracy/Performance** Evaluating benchmark scores and overall accuracy are crucial for model selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. This can also be broadly categorized as "capabilities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.
*   **Deployment Environment** Considerations include whether the model will be served on-premises or off-premises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
*   **Open Source vs. Closed Source** The licensing and accessibility of the model's code are important factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

## Trends in AI Model Deployment

Future trends suggest a shift in how [[AI models and training methods | AI models]] are deployed and used:

*   **On-Device Deployment** It is predicted that the majority of deployed [[AI models and training methods | models]] will operate directly on devices within approximately 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   **Smaller, Specialized Models** There is an anticipated trend towards smaller [[AI models and training methods | models]] that are specifically [[customization_and_scalability_in_ai_models | hyperspecialized]] for particular tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. These smaller models may be [[techniques_for_improving_ai_model_efficiency | orchestrated]] together to perform more complex functions, moving away from sole reliance on larger, general-purpose models that require sending data elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

> [!tip] AI Model Training
> It is suggested that out of approximately five people currently [[ai_model_training_and_inference | training]] large [[AI models and training methods | models]] today, at least one will no longer be involved in [[ai_model_training_and_inference | training AI models]] by the end of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This highlights potential volatility or shifts in the field of [[ai_model_training_and_inference | AI model training]].

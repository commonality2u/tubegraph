Mismanagement of AI resources can lead to "company crippling, career ending failure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a> and even "total collapse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. This often involves embracing "worse practices" to "completely torpedo your projects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a> and "alienate everyone that you work with" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Seeding Division and Disconnect

A crucial step in mismanagement is to "divide and conquer your own company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This means:
*   **Embracing Disconnect** Disregarding the relationship between willingness to pay, price, and cost, by contemplating "unreasonable goals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. This involves adhering to an "anti-value stick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a> where:
    *   **WTP (Wishful Thinking Promises)** Telling customers that AI will do "absolutely everything for them" without worrying about details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
    *   **Price (Particularly Ridiculous Infrastructure Costs)** Buying the most expensive GPUs without cost-benefit analysis, "max[ing] out the company credit card" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
    *   **Cost (Cascade of Spectacular Technical Debt)** Building systems that are "so convoluted, so intertwined that even you as an executive can barely understand it," ensuring job security when it inevitably breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
    *   **WTS (Why This System?)** Justifying AI projects with "because AI," as "no board is ever going to question you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   **Creating Silos** Attending every AI industry conference but "never go back and talk about what you learned with your team" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. The objective is to "create impenetrable silos and incentivize secrecy between your teams" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## Defining a Flawed Strategy

When defining an AI strategy, it's essential to:
*   **Fake Diagnosis** Grab old reports, highlight random paragraphs (especially those least understood), and declare them "a must fix" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Crucially, "don't bother talking to anyone who actually does the work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   **Ambiguous Guiding Policy** Use "incredibly ambiguous and vague" statements like "become the global AI leader in everything" without defining "everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   **Unrealistic Action Plan** Announce plans for AI-powered SEO tools, generative art plug-ins, and AI drone lunch delivery services at company meetings, using words like "disruptive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   **Avoid Timelines** "Embrace Perpetual beta" and create a "massive backlog in GitHub" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>, as "timelines are for companies that intend to finish projects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Creating 4,000-page documents and posting them everywhere can "erode people's willpower to engage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

## Communicating in Jargon

Effective mismanagement involves communicating in a way that "nobody understands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   **Tsunami of Jargon** Drown everyone in complex terms like "multimodal agentic Transformer based system leverages F shot learning and Chain of Thought reasoning to optimize the synergistic potential of our Dynamic hyper hyper parameter space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. The goal is to "look incredibly smart even if nobody understands a word you're saying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
*   **Strategic Obfuscation** Use jargon to "hide the jobs to be done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. For example, instead of saying "write a prompt," say "we're building agents," which ensures "mental health experts were not in the room and didn't know how to participate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Similarly, instead of "make sure the AI has the right context," talk about "Rags," and instead of "make sure users can trick the AI into doing something bad," say "prompt injections" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   **Engineer-Centric Prompting** Encourage engineers, "not the people who might best understand your customers," to write prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. The aim is to make "everything even writing prompts seems super technical and Out Of Reach for everyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

## Flawed Mobilization and Deployment

When mobilizing for AI projects, adopt a "zoning to lose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a> framework:
*   **Random Task Assignment** "Randomly assign AI tasks to people with absolutely no relevant experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>, such as outsourcing data review to offshore Q&A teams with "very little context about your business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **Direct-to-Customer Launch** Launch "completely untested bug written AI chat Bots directly to your customers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a> from the incubation zone, "never worry about beta testing," and "disregard quality assurance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. The worst outcome is a "potentially career-ending PR disaster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   **Resource Misallocation** "Yank all your best Engineers from potentially supporting your Revenue producing products" for AI projects, leading to "total collapse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

## Focus on Tools Over Processes

To ensure failure, "focus on tools not processes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a> and "burn it all to the ground" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>:
*   **Tool-Centric Problem Solving** Instead of analyzing problems, "just throw tools at them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. If a RAG system fails, "just buy a new more expensive Vector database" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. If agents aren't working, "just pick a new framework and vendor" and "F tune without any measurement or evaluation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.
*   **Blindly Trusting Metrics** Use "every off-the-shelf evaluation metric you can possibly find," never customizing them for business needs, and "blindly trust the numbers even if they make no sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Evlas are a "vendor problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>, with a "one size fits all solution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. Create dashboards with "every off-the-shelf metric," ensuring they are unintelligible and don't track outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. Hoard metrics until one "is going up and to the right," then "claim success" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. Adopt all evaluation frameworks, letting them guide blindly, and never ask if they measure success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. Optimize for metrics like "cosine similarity, BL, and Rouge, ignoring actual user experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>, and "never cross check with domain experts or your users" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

## Avoiding Data

The "most potent technique" for mismanagement is to "avoid looking at data" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.
*   **Blind Trust in AI** Let a tool handle data because you can "absolutely 100% trust the ai's output without ever looking at it yourself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. Looking at data is an "engineering problem," not for leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.
*   **Trust Your Gut** "Trust your gut" as it is a "reliable substitute for data, especially when you're making million-dollar decisions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.
*   **Exclude Non-Engineers from Data** Ensure "no one else is looking at data" by putting it in "complex systems that only Engineers can access and it's not available to domain experts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. Insist on buying custom data analysis platforms requiring "a team of phds to operate and understand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>, especially if it takes six months to load and has "errors incessant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.

Following these practices "meticulously" is "guaranteed that you're going to waste time, resources and alienate all the people you work with" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.

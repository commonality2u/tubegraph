Evaluating AI agents and assistance is crucial to ensure they function effectively in real-world production environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. While the development of various AI agents and tools receives significant attention, understanding their performance post-deployment is equally vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This article delves into the [[evaluating_ai_agents_methods_and_metrics | methods and metrics]] for assessing AI agents, with a specific focus on the [[challenges_in_ai_agent_evaluation | challenges in AI agent evaluation]], particularly regarding path convergence.

## Components of an AI Agent
Regardless of the framework used (e.g., Lan graph, Crei, Llama Index Workflow) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, AI agents typically consist of common architectural patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>:

*   **Router**: This component acts as the "boss" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, deciding the agent's next step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. For instance, in an e-commerce agent, a router determines whether a user query like "I want to make a return" should trigger a customer service skill, a discount suggestion, or a product search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Skills**: These are the logical chains that perform the actual work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. A skill flow might involve LLM calls or API calls to execute a user's request <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   **Memory**: This component stores past interactions to enable multi-turn conversations, preventing the agent from forgetting previous statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

## Evaluating AI Agent Performance
Each component of an AI agent presents an opportunity for errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. Therefore, [[evaluating_ai_agents_and_assistance | evaluating AI agents and assistance]] requires assessing each part. Engineers building and [[strategies_for_ai_evaluation_and_troubleshooting | troubleshooting]] agents typically examine "traces" to understand the internal workings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

### Evaluating the Router
For routers, the primary concern is whether the correct skill was called <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. If a user asks for leggings but is sent to customer service, the router made an incorrect decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. It's also important to verify that the router passes the correct parameters to the chosen skill, such as material type or cost range for a product search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

### Evaluating Skills
Skill evaluation involves assessing multiple aspects, especially in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) type skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. This includes:
*   **Relevance**: Checking the relevance of retrieved chunks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Correctness**: Ensuring the generated answer is correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.
Evaluations can involve LLM-as-a-judge assessments or code-based evaluations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

### Evaluating Agent Path and Convergence
One of the most challenging aspects of [[challenges_in_ai_agent_evaluation | evaluating AI agents methods and metrics]] is assessing the agent's path or "convergence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Ideally, when a skill is called multiple times for the same task, it should consistently take a similar, succinct number of steps to complete the query, input parameters, call components, and generate the correct answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

The [[challenges_in_creating_effective_ai_agents | challenge in creating effective AI agents]] arises because the number of steps an agent takes can vary wildly, even when built with different LLMs like OpenAI versus Anthropic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. The goal is to ensure:
*   **Succinctness**: The agent takes the most efficient path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.
*   **Reliability**: The number of steps remains consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
*   **Consistency**: The agent reliably completes tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

Measuring and evaluating this "convergence" or counting the number of steps is considered one of the hardest [[challenges in AI agent development | challenges in AI agent development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

## Special Considerations for Voice AI
Voice AI, which is revolutionizing call centers with over a billion calls made globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, introduces additional layers of evaluation complexity for multimodal agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Beyond text or transcript evaluation, the actual audio chunks must be assessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. This includes evaluating:
*   User sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>
*   Speech-to-text transcription accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>
*   Consistency of tone throughout the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>

## Multi-Layered Evaluation for Debugging
Effective [[evaluating_ai_agents_methods_and_metrics | strategies for AI evaluation and troubleshooting]] involve implementing evaluations at every step of an agent's trace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. This allows for precise debugging when issues arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. For example, if an agent's response is incorrect, evaluations across the entire application's flow — at the router level, skill level, and throughout the execution — help pinpoint exactly where the error occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

> [!Example]
> The speaker's company evaluates their own co-pilot by running evaluations at each step of its trace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. This includes:
> *   Overall correctness of the generated response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.
> *   Whether the search router picked the correct router and passed the right arguments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.
> *   If the task or skill was correctly completed in its execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

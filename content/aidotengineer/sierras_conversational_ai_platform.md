Sierra is a conversational AI platform designed for businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Initially known for chat experiences and customer service, Sierra is expanding its offerings significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. By the end of the year, most interactions are projected to occur over the phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The platform serves customers across various functions including sales, subscription management, and product recommendations, covering all aspects of the [[customer_success_with_ai_solutions | customer experience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Evolution of AI and Sierra's Approach

Reflecting on the rapid advancements in AI, the speaker notes that previous discussions often framed "ancient history" in AI as starting in the 2020s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. The speaker, Zach Reno, brings a perspective from 2016, when he worked at Google on the first version of Google Lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. This involved training computers to distinguish between visually similar objects, such as Chihuahuas and blueberry muffins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

The experience of [[building_user_experiences_with_ai | building user experiences with AI]] then, highlighted the non-deterministic nature of AI models, where consistent results were not guaranteed, feeling like a "slot machine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. This emphasizes a key challenge in AI development: the non-determinism of inputs or outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

Google Lens has since evolved significantly, now offering features like visual search, shopping integration, text translation, and even math homework assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. This progress is attributed to consistent, step-by-step iteration over a decade, guided by a robust software development life cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

## Partnership with Chubbies

Chubbies, a brand known for its forward-thinking approach to customer experience, partnered with Sierra to deploy an AI agent named Duncan Smothers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. The collaboration was based on the belief that in 2025, an AI agent will be as essential for businesses as a website was in 1995 or a social profile in the 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

Duncan Smothers is an AI agent on the Chubbies website capable of handling various customer inquiries:
*   **Sizing and Fit**: Empathetically helps customers with sizing questions and offers product recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   **Inventory Tracking**: Informs customers about product stock and helps them choose new items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   **Package Tracking and Refunds**: Provides multiple tracking numbers for orders and can issue refunds, demonstrating autonomous action beyond just answering questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

The results for Chubbies include helping more customers more quickly and with higher satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

## The Agent Development Life Cycle (ADLC)

Sierra views every AI agent as a product, necessitating a fully featured developer and customer experience operations platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. The company employs dedicated agent engineering and product management teams that work directly with customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

The Agent Development Life Cycle (ADLC) is Sierra's process for building and improving AI agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. It borrows concepts from the traditional software development life cycle but adapts them for the unique challenges of large language models (LLMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

> [!NOTE] LLM Challenges vs. Traditional Software
> While traditional software is deterministic, fast, cheap, and rigid, LLMs are non-deterministic, slow, expensive to run, but flexible, creative, and capable of reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. The ADLC aims to leverage LLM strengths while integrating traditional software where beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

### Quality Assurance in ADLC
A critical part of the ADLC is iterative refinement with customers in production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. Sierra provides an "Experience Manager" allowing customers to:
*   Review every conversation an agent has <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.
*   View high-level reports on agent performance in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   Provide feedback, which leads to issue filing, test creation, and eventually a new release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
Over time, a Sierra agent evolves from a handful of tests at launch to hundreds and thousands as it improves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.
Additionally, agents can be empowered to go "above and beyond," such as having a budget to delight customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

Improvements in AI, such as reasoning models, act as a "force multiplier" in the ADLC, making development, testing, and QA more effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

## Voice AI Capabilities

Sierra has significantly invested in [[voice_ai_engineering_challenges_and_solutions | voice AI engineering challenges and solutions]], launching voice capabilities generally available in October <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. One large customer, Sirius XM, utilizes Sierra's voice capabilities to answer calls immediately, every time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

Sierra's approach to voice AI is akin to responsive web design: the same underlying platform and agent code can adapt to different channels and modalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. This allows for customization of phrasing or layout while maintaining a unified system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.

## Philosophy of AI Agents

The fascinating aspect of [[introduction_and_application_of_ai_in_business_platforms | building AI in business platforms]] is that LLMs remind us of ourselves: they are unpredictable, slow, and not great at math <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. However, this human-like unpredictability also enables designers to build with empathy, putting themselves in the "shoes of the robot" to create better experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.

Sierra focuses on [[building_a_reliable_conversation_system_for_voice_agents | building a reliable conversation system for voice agents]] by creating robust agents that receive the same rich inputs and experiences that humans do, going beyond mere transcribed text with delay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>.

Anthropic is an [[role_of_ai_in_research_and_data_analytics | AI]] safety and research company focused on building the world's best and safest large language models (LLMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Founded a few years ago by [[influential_ai_researchers | leading experts in AI]], Anthropic has consistently released frontier models while pioneering safety techniques, research, and policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Mission and Approach
Anthropic's daily work involves collaborating with [[influential_ai_researchers | AI leaders]] who are solving real business problems that seemed impossible just a year prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Their mission is to provide actionable insights based on hundreds of customer interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Key Research Directions

Anthropic's research is distributed across model capabilities, product research, and [[ethics_and_adoption_challenges_of_ai_agents | AI safety]], with significant overlap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

### Interpretability
A distinguishing research direction for Anthropic is interpretability, which involves reverse engineering models to understand how and why they "think," and then steering them for specific use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

Interpretability research is still in its early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>, but Anthropic approaches it in stages:
*   **Understanding** Grasping [[role_of_ai_in_research_and_data_analytics | AI]] decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Detection** Understanding specific behaviors and labeling them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **Steering** Influencing the [[role_of_ai_in_research_and_data_analytics | AI's]] input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   **Explainability** Unlocking business value from interpretability methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

In the long term, interpretability is expected to significantly improve [[ethics_and_adoption_challenges_of_ai_agents | AI safety]], reliability, and usability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. The interpretability team uses methods to understand feature activations at the model level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. This can lead to a better grasp of the model's thinking and behavior, or even the discovery of "sleeper agents" for safety reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

An example of feature activation is when a model, asked about NBA scores, activates "feature number 304 famous NBA players" when mentioning someone like Steph Curry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. This represents a group of neurons activating in a recognizable pattern across all mentions of famous basketball players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

An example of steering is "Golden Gate Claude," where activating the "Golden Gate" feature caused Claude to integrate it into unrelated responses, such as suggesting painting a bedroom "red like the Golden Gate Bridge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

## Applying AI and Ensuring Reliability

Anthropic works with customers to embed [[role_of_ai_in_research_and_data_analytics | AI]] into their products and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>, and empowers organizations to use [[role_of_ai_in_research_and_data_analytics | AI]] in day-to-day work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

They encourage customers to use [[role_of_ai_in_research_and_data_analytics | AI]] to solve core product problems, moving beyond basic chatbots and summarization to place "bigger bets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. For instance, in an onboarding and upskilling platform, [[role_of_ai_in_research_and_data_analytics | AI]] could hyper-personalize course content, adapt dynamically to a user's pace, or update material based on learning styles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

Anthropic sees [[role_of_ai_in_research_and_data_analytics | AI]] impacting various industries, including taxes, legal, and project management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. These applications drastically enhance customer experience by making it easier to use and more [[building_trust_and_community_in_ai_applications | trustworthy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. For critical workflows like taxes, high-quality output without hallucinations is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

### Case Study: Intercom's Finn AI Agent
Anthropic partnered with Intercom, an [[ai_in_healthcare | AI]] customer service platform with an [[ethics_and_adoption_challenges_of_ai_agents | AI agent]] called Finn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. They conducted a two-month sprint, optimizing Intercom's prompts with Claude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. This resulted in Anthropic's model outperforming Intercom's previous LLM in benchmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

Finn 2, powered by Anthropic, can solve up to 86% of customer support volume, with 51% out of the box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. It also provides a more [[human_oversight_and_interaction_in_aidriven_analysis | human element]], allowing for tone adjustment, answer length control, and policy awareness, such as refund policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. This partnership highlights Anthropic's commitment to creating helpful, reliable, and non-deflecting [[ethics_and_adoption_challenges_of_ai_agents | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

## Best Practices and Common Mistakes in AI Implementation

Anthropic's applied [[the_evolution_and_current_state_of_ai_engineering | AI engineering]] team supports the technical aspects of use cases, helping design architectures, evaluations, and tweak prompts to get the best out of their models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. They also bring customer feedback back to Anthropic to build better products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

### Testing and Evaluation
A common mistake is building a robust workflow *before* designing evaluations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. Evaluations should direct the path to a perfect outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. Without proper evaluation, one might just be "trusting the vibes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

It's crucial to design representative test cases, including "silly examples" that a user might unexpectedly ask, to ensure the model responds appropriately or reroutes the question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. The model's behavior in a "latent space" changes with different functions like prompt engineering or prompt caching, and evaluations are the only empirical way to know its performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. Robust evaluations are considered "intellectual property" that enables outcompeting others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

### Identifying Metrics
Organizations often optimize for one or two metrics in the "intelligence-cost-latency triangle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. This balance should be defined in advance, making a conscious trade-off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>. For a customer support use case, low latency (e.g., under 10 seconds) is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>, whereas for a financial research analyst, a longer response time might be acceptable due to the high stakes of the decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. User experience (UX) considerations, like "thinking boxes" or redirecting users, can also influence latency perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

### Fine-tuning
Fine-tuning is not a "silver bullet" and comes at a cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>. It can limit the model's reasoning in fields outside the specific fine-tuning domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>. Anthropic encourages trying other approaches first, ensuring clear success criteria, and only resorting to fine-tuning if necessary for a specific intelligence domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.

### Other Methods to Explore
Beyond basic prompt engineering, various features and architectures can drastically change the success of a use case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. These include:
*   **Prompt caching** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>
*   **Contextual retrieval** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>
*   **Citations** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>
*   **Agentic architectures** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>

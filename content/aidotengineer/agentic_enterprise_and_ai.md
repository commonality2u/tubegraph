Presented by Hbert Mishtella of Novartis, this article explores the concept of the [[ai_in_enterprise_and_startups | Agentic Enterprise]], focusing on how [[ai_agents_and_agentic_workflows | AI agents]] can impact organizations and what leadership needs to know to prepare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The discussion covers workflows, organizational networks, challenges, and individual employee perspectives on [[the_impact_and_future_potential_of_ai_and_agents | the impact and future potential of AI and agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## The Rise of AI Agents in the Enterprise

It is a provocative, yet realistic, statement that in three years, organizations might be run by [[ai_agents_and_agentic_workflows | AI agents]] given the current pace of AI development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

### What is an AI Agent?
An [[role_of_ai_agents_and_agentic_frameworks | AI agent]] is defined as a Large Language Model (LLM) based application that exhibits a certain degree of autonomy in its behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Its core function involves using a language model to "glue together" various specific tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. [[ai_agents_and_agentic_workflows | AI agents]] execute tasks through a step-by-step planning process, utilizing different tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. The use of these tools can be dynamically adjusted based on the outcome of previous steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This capability introduces a new level of functionality that was previously almost unique to humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### Key Capabilities of AI Agents
Organizations should focus on evolving their digital assets for the effective use of [[ai_agents_and_agentic_workflows | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, aiming for every digital asset to become either a tool for an [[ai_agents_and_agentic_workflows | AI agent]] or an agent itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

The key capabilities that make [[ai_agents_and_agentic_workflows | AI agents]] transformative include:
*   **Reasoning for multi-step planning**: Enabling complex task execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Adaptability for dynamic work**: Adjusting to changing conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   **Persistent memory**: Retaining context over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   **Contextual knowledge (RAG)**: Utilizing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to access specific external knowledge not available in the language model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   **Interactive workspaces**: Collaborating iteratively with an [[ai_agents_and_agentic_workflows | AI agent]] in sandboxes or canvases to refine tasks like coding or art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   **Computer-using agents**: Navigating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to automate steps previously done only by humans or through Robotic Process Automation (RPA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

## Transforming Workflows with AI Agents

Workflows are the actual execution of processes within a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Technology can be applied in two ways:
*   **Automation**: Substituting a specific step with technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
*   **Augmentation**: Performing a step quicker or better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

While machine learning (ML) could previously automate or augment some tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, the difference today lies in [[agentic_architectures_for_generative_ai | agentic workflows]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

### Agentic Workflows
[[agentic_architectures_for_generative_ai | Agentic workflows]] are possible now for two main reasons:
1.  [[ai_agents_and_agentic_workflows | AI agents]] can tackle a broader set of tasks, operating on cognitive steps that are precisely represented in natural language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
2.  Language models and [[ai_agents_and_agentic_workflows | AI agents]] can act as a "glue" between tasks, composing them together without human intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Human feedback is only needed when the agent requires it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

This allows for the automation and delegation of not just one, but multiple steps in a process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

### First Takeaway for Leadership
To start building [[ai_agents_and_agentic_workflows | agents]], organizations must first identify their workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Crucially, they need to understand the exact context around these workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. This context, including data, systems, and transformation steps, is often unrecorded and resides only in employees' heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This "buried" knowledge, distributed across teams and systems, presents a significant challenge that companies must overcome to effectively leverage [[ai_agents_and_agentic_workflows | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

## Organizational Perspective: The Network of Personas

Relying solely on traditional roles and job titles is insufficient for applying [[ai_agents_and_agentic_workflows | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. To effectively implement an [[ai_agents_and_agentic_workflows | AI agent]], one needs to understand the specific tools to be used, the planning required, and the conditions for changing behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

A more helpful approach is to consider a network perspective, defining different archetypes or personas for each contributor to a workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. Examples of personas include:
*   **Silent Achiever**: High performance, lower communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   **Individual Contributor**: Strong in both performance and communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   **Connector**: Links non-adjacent teams within the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
*   **Multiplier**: Enhances the work of other team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Knowledge Hub**: Provides domain expertise or necessary information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

Defining these personas allows for a better understanding of how [[ai_agents_and_agentic_workflows | AI agents]] might impact workflows and specific employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. This detailed view is necessary for a global organizational understanding, identifying similarities and differences across teams, and optimizing for the development of [[ai_agents_and_agentic_workflows | agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

### Second Takeaway for Leadership
To help organizations and people adapt to AI, looking at employee personas is a helpful first step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

## Impact on Roles and Emerging Patterns

The introduction of [[ai_agents_and_agentic_workflows | AI agents]] will change workflows dramatically. For example, a "silent achiever" with a coding assistant might become productive enough to handle work previously done by multiple people in several steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. An agent can magnify the impact of a "multiplier" persona, extending their influence beyond adjacent team members to the entire team, leading to higher performance and better communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. A "knowledge hub" persona is highly prone to substitution by an [[ai_agents_and_agentic_workflows | AI agent]], which can dynamically support all team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.

The key is to understand the archetypes or personas of employees across different workflows to project and plan for the development of various [[ai_agents_and_agentic_workflows | agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. Identifying repeating patterns in workflows (e.g., issues always on the first step) indicates what kind of [[ai_agents_and_agentic_workflows | agents]] need to be built for optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.

### Emerging Patterns
*   **Human vs. AI Tasks**: Tasks where ambiguity is high, or subjectivity is desired, are better for humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. Repetitive, tedious tasks where perfect, consistent execution is needed are ideal for [[ai_agents_and_agentic_workflows | agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.
*   **Intelligence and Domain Knowledge as Commodity**: These attributes will become cheap and easily available, no longer providing a competitive edge for employees or companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.
*   **Shift in Employee Focus**: Employees and companies will need to pivot towards multi-disciplinary know-how or much deeper specialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. Senior engineers might work directly with product and domain experts, developing quicker with assistants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.
*   **Agents as Super Connectors**: [[ai_agents_and_agentic_workflows | Agents]] can enhance communication and impact across teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>.
*   **Increased Value of Context Understanding**: This will gain more value compared to intelligence or domain expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.
*   **AI Supercharges "Doers"**: People who perform tasks can do even more and quicker, potentially leading to a "100 times engineer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.
*   **Polarization and New Specializations**: A polarization in positions and tasks is expected, leading to very new specializations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>.

### New Roles in AI-Mature Organizations
New roles might appear, such as:
*   Workflow Minor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>
*   Human [[OpenAIs approach to integrating AI in enterprises | AI Orchestrator]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>

## Enabling AI Adoption: A Phased Approach

For executives, democratizing [[OpenAIs approach to integrating AI in enterprises | AI adoption]] across the organization is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>. This typically follows a step-by-step progression:
1.  **General Assistants**: Provide access to general [[ai_agents_and_agentic_workflows | AI assistants]] (likely already in place) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.
2.  **Individual Assistants**: Offer personalized assistants per employee with memory, context understanding, and personal databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>. This allows employees to work more closely with their specific context without repetition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.
3.  **Employee-Built Agents**: Enable employees to quickly build their own [[developing_ai_agents_and_agentic_workflows | agents]] for optimized workflows using coding assistants, no-code, and low-code tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. This requires employees to develop "cognitive self-awareness" – understanding the specific mental and system steps they perform to achieve a goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>.
4.  **Digital Twins**: Implement [[ai_agents_and_agentic_workflows | agents]] as "digital twins" or "time travelers" to retain organizational knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>. This means an agent can represent an employee's knowledge and expertise, allowing for reconstruction of past processes and answering questions even after an employee leaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>.
5.  **Multi-Employee Agents**: Develop [[ai_agents_and_agentic_workflows | agents]] that serve not just one employee but entire teams or workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>.
6.  **Swarm of Agents**: Progress to a swarm of [[ai_agents_and_agentic_workflows | agents]], where software is already available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.

This progression is enabled by the maturing software stack around LLMs and [[ai_agents_and_agentic_workflows | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.

## Challenges and Opportunities

### Challenges
*   **Adoption**: A significant cultural question is whether organizations are ready for [[ai_agents_and_agentic_workflows | AI agents]] to not just receive delegated tasks, but to drive interactions and even delegate subtasks to humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>.
*   **Ethics of Autonomy**:
    *   Defining explicit values for [[ai_agents_and_agentic_workflows | AI agents]] to uphold as "value keepers" is a primary challenge, as humans themselves don't always agree on values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>.
    *   Resolving conflicts or interactions between humans and [[ai_agents_and_agentic_workflows | AI agents]] presents a new, interesting challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>.
    *   As machines gain more freedom, they will require increasingly defined moral standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>.

### Opportunities
*   **Simulation**: Simulating synthetic reality before real-life activities in marketing, labs, or other areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>.
*   **Proactive Insights**: Proactively understanding regulatory loopholes or identifying mergers and acquisitions (M&A) opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>.

## Executive Summary: Key Takeaways for Leadership

*   **Outdated Strategy**: If your organizational strategy still makes sense when "AI agent" is swapped with "machine learning" or "data", it's likely outdated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>.

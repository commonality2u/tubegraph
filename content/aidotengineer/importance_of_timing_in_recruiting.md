Finding the right person in recruiting is as much about timing as it is about talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. Timing in this context means two things: identifying when candidates are most likely to leave their current roles and finding individuals with the propensity to join a company at a specific stage to elevate the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

## Understanding Retention and Poachability
Analyzing company retention rates can indicate when potential candidates are most likely to be receptive to outreach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. This effectively helps create a "poachability score" for candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. For example, in the AI industry:
*   Anthropic has demonstrated a 66% four-year retention rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.
*   Perplexity has a four-year retention rate hovering around 44% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

## Generational Mobility
Different generations exhibit distinct behaviors regarding job changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. In 2023, nearly 27% of Gen Z left their jobs, which is more than twice the rate of Gen X <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. Within four years of graduating, Gen Z typically holds about 2.2 jobs, compared to Gen X's 1.1 jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. This higher mobility in Gen Z can be attributed to factors like slower promotion rates, market layoffs, and a greater inclination towards taking risks and betting on themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

## Historical Composition and Identifying Key Hires
It's crucial to understand a candidate's career trajectory and their experiences at different companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. SignalFire developed a tool called "historical composition" that provides a snapshot of admired companies' organizational structures at various points in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. This tool helps identify:
*   The risk profile of candidates: whether they are likely to join a company at your stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.
*   Their motivations for moving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.
*   Whether they are a potential "10x hire" who can significantly elevate the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

For example, it can show who the sales leaders were that scaled a company from $1 million to $10 million in revenue, or who the first three engineers were on a team that shipped a key product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.

## Key Takeaways for Timing in Recruiting
*   **Outreach and Impact**: Understand when competitors or admired companies are likely to lose employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. Track professional profiles for changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.
*   **Generational Patterns**: Study the job-changing patterns of different generations or population segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.
*   **Career Trajectories**: Knowing when people join and leave companies helps identify ideal candidates and those likely to align with your company's stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.

For job seekers, understanding timing means knowing where admired professionals go, how long they stay, and what they want in their own career arc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>.

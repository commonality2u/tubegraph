Alma, a nutrition companion application, has developed the "Alma score" to help users understand the quality of their food intake beyond just calories and macronutrients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. This feature addresses the user's desire to know "how holistically well they're eating" and "the quality of a food" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. The developers recognized that "1,000 calories could be had a million different ways" and "not all of it is equal in terms of quality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Development and Purpose

The Alma score concept was developed with the academic adviser at Harvard University, Dr. Eric Prim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

The score aims to:
*   Provide a simple metric, presented as a score out of 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
*   Steer users throughout the day towards foods that are "fundamentally good for your health" based on decades of scientific research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   Nudge users away from foods known to be less beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

This focus on food quality helps Alma fulfill its mission of making eating well easier and providing simple, [[personalized_nutrition_and_ai | personalized nutrition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

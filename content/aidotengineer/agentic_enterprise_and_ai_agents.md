Presented by Hbert Mishtella of Novardis, this article explores the concept of the [[agentic_architectures_and_systems_design | agentic enterprise]] and the profound impact of [[importance_and_progress_of_ai_agents | AI agents]] on workflows, organizational structures, and individual roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. It addresses the challenges and opportunities for organizations preparing for a future run by AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## The Rise of AI Agents
It's projected that within three years, organizations might be run by [[importance_and_progress_of_ai_agents | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

### What is an AI Agent?
An [[importance_and_progress_of_ai_agents | AI agent]] is an application based on a Large Language Model (LLM) that exhibits autonomy in its behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### [[components_of_ai_agents | Components of AI Agents]] and Capabilities
[[components_of_ai_agents | AI agents]] are composed of a language model that orchestrates specific actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. They execute planning in a step-by-step fashion, utilizing various tools, and can adjust their actions based on previous steps, known as "dynamic action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

Key capabilities provided by [[importance_and_progress_of_ai_agents | AI agents]] include:
*   Reasoning for multi-step planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   Adaptability for dynamic work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   Control and persistent memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   Contextual understanding, often leveraging Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for specific knowledge not within the language model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   Interactive workspaces (sandboxes, canvas) for collaborative refinement of tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   Computer-using agents that can navigate graphical user interfaces to automate tasks previously performed by humans or Robotic Process Automation (RPA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

### Preparing for AI Agents
Every company should be working on digital assets and evolving them for the usage of [[importance_and_progress_of_ai_agents | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Conceptually, every digital asset in an organization should become a tool for an [[importance_and_progress_of_ai_agents | AI agent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## The Workflow Perspective
A workflow is the execution of a process, typically defined by sequential steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

### Automation vs. Augmentation
Traditionally, technology has been used in two ways:
*   **Automation**: Substituting a specific step with technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   **Augmentation**: Making a step quicker or better with technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

While machine learning could achieve some of this before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>, [[importance_and_progress_of_ai_agents | AI agents]] offer a significant difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

### Agentic Workflows
The advent of [[importance_and_progress_of_ai_agents | AI agents]] enables "agentic workflows" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a> because:
1.  [[importance_and_progress_of_ai_agents | AI agents]] can tackle a broader set of tasks, operating on cognitive steps often represented in natural language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
2.  [[importance_and_progress_of_ai_agents | AI agents]] can act as "glue" between tasks, composing them together without human intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Human feedback is only needed when the agent requires it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

This allows for the automation and delegation of not just one, but multiple steps in a workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

> **Takeaway 1:** To start [[building_ai_agents_in_the_enterprise_sdlc | building agents]], first identify your workflows and deeply understand the context around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. This context (data used, systems, transformations) is often unrecorded and buried in employees' heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

## The Network Perspective: Personas
Relying solely on traditional roles and job titles is insufficient for applying [[importance_and_progress_of_ai_agents | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. To understand how to apply an [[importance_and_progress_of_ai_agents | AI agent]], one needs to know the exact tools to use, how to plan, and conditions for changing behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

### Defining Personas
Thinking about each contributor to a workflow as a "persona" provides more useful information than job titles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. Examples of personas:
*   **Silent Achiever**: Lower communication, high performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   **Individual Contributor**: Good communication and performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
*   **Connector**: Connects non-adjacent teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
*   **Multiplier**: Enhances the work of other team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Knowledge Hub**: Provides domain expertise or necessary information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

Defining personas helps project how [[importance_and_progress_of_ai_agents | AI agents]] will impact workflows and specific employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. This global-level view helps identify similarities and differences across teams, which can guide agent optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

> **Takeaway 2:** To help your organization and people adapt to AI, consider looking at workflows through the lens of personas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

### Impact of AI Agents on Workflows and Personas
With [[importance_and_progress_of_ai_agents | AI agents]], workflows can become more efficient:
*   A "silent achiever" with a coding assistant can become so productive they can perform work previously requiring multiple people or steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
*   A "multiplier" persona's impact can be magnified by an [[importance_and_progress_of_ai_agents | AI agent]], extending their influence beyond adjacent team members to the entire team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.
*   A "knowledge hub" persona is most prone to substitution by an [[importance_and_progress_of_ai_agents | AI agent]], as a well-prepared agent can dynamically support all team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

The key is to understand the archetypes or personas of employees across different workflows to plan for the development of different agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.

## Emerging Patterns and New Roles
When considering which tasks are better for humans vs. [[importance_and_progress_of_ai_agents | AI agents]]:
*   **Humans**: Ambiguous workflows where outcomes depend heavily on specific situations, or when subjectivity is desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.
*   **AI Agents**: Repetitive, tedious tasks, or when perfect, consistent execution is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.

Emerging patterns:
*   **Intelligence and Domain Knowledge as Commodity**: These attributes become cheap and easily available, no longer providing a competitive edge for employees or companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.
*   **Shift in Skillset**: Employees and companies need to pivot towards multidisciplinary know-how or much deeper specialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>.
*   **Engineers and Domain Experts**: Senior engineers may work directly with domain experts on product development, accelerating work with coding assistants and domain assistant agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.
*   **Agents as Super Connectors**: [[importance_and_progress_of_ai_agents | AI agents]] can facilitate connections across teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.
*   **Value of Context Understanding**: This will gain more value than raw intelligence or domain expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.
*   **AI Supercharges Doers**: People who perform tasks can do even more and quicker, potentially leading to a "100 times engineer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.
*   **Polarization of Positions**: Fewer middle-ground positions, leading to new and highly specialized roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>.

New roles in AI-mature organizations may include:
*   Workflow Minor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.
*   Human-AI Orchestrator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.

## [[implementing_ai_in_enterprises | Enabling AI Adoption and Democratization]]
To democratize and accelerate the [[ai_in_enterprise_applications | AI agent revolution]], organizations should follow a step-by-step approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>:
1.  **General Assistants**: Provide access to general AI assistants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.
2.  **Individual Assistants**: Offer individual assistants per employee, with memory, context understanding, and personal databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>. This allows employees to work more closely with their specific context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.
3.  **Employee-Built Agents**: Enable employees to quickly build agents themselves using coding assistants, no-code, and low-code tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. This requires employees to develop "cognitive self-awareness" to translate their internal thought processes and steps into explicit instructions for agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>.
4.  **Digital Twins**: Utilize digital twins (like "time travelers" and "memory") to retain organizational knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>. This prevents knowledge loss when experienced employees leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>.
5.  **Multi-Employee Agents**: Develop agents that serve entire teams or workflows, not just individual employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>.
6.  **Swarm of Agents**: Progress to managing and deploying swarms of agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.

This progression is now possible due to the maturing software stack around LLMs and [[components_of_ai_agents | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>.

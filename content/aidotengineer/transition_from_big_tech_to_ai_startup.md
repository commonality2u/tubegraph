From: [[aidotengineer]] <br/> 

Munir, CEO and co-founder of Porsche [[AI in enterprise and startups | AI]], shares his journey and insights from transitioning from various product roles at large tech companies like Stripe, Google, and Amazon to founding his own [[AI in enterprise and startups | AI]] startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This presentation aims to provide useful notes for those looking to make a similar leap or who are in a similar early-stage [[AI in enterprise and startups | AI]] startup phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Munir's Background

Munir has a background in big tech, always based in London <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. His previous roles include:
*   Launching Amazon's deals program in the UK, used for events like Black Friday and Prime Day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   Launching and growing Google Pay in 30 markets across EMEA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   Leading Bank as a Service at [[ai_strategies_in_financial_technology_companies | Stripe]] for EMEA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

He always aspired to start his own venture, reaching a point where "nothing else made sense anymore" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Porsche [[AI in enterprise and startups | AI]]

Porsche [[AI in enterprise and startups | AI]] was founded in June of the previous year (approximately a year prior to the presentation) with co-founder Emma, whom Munir met at [[ai_strategies_in_financial_technology_companies | Stripe]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. It is an open-source SDK for [[building_successful_ai_projects_with_small_teams | building]] production agents, with a particular focus on regulated industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Lessons Learned in an [[AI in enterprise and startups | AI]] Startup

Munir highlights several key lessons and observations from his experience:

### 1. User Problems and Discovery

The process of identifying user problems and conducting user discovery in an [[AI in enterprise and startups | AI]] startup is "freaking different" from big tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

*   **Emergent Problems**: Unlike established product areas where problems have shape and adjacency to known issues (e.g., payment products at [[ai_strategies_in_financial_technology_companies | Stripe]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, in [[AI in enterprise and startups | AI]], user problems are often an emergent property of the space and not yet defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **Rapidly Changing Technology**: What is possible with [[AI in enterprise and startups | AI]] technology changes very quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Hypothesis-Driven Iteration**: Traditional three or six-month roadmaps are less effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. Instead, it's necessary to make directional bets and iterate very fast by putting products out and observing user reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. The focus for the team becomes hypothesis-driven, deliberate iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

> [!analogy] Soulslike Game Analogy
> Understanding user problems in [[AI in enterprise and startups | AI]] feels like the first time playing a "Soulslike game" such as Nioh, where configuring a character is challenging because "nothing makes sense at first" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Users know they want to use [[AI in enterprise and startups | AI]] and see opportunity, but they don't know their specific problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

> [!analogy] No Man's Sky Analogy
> Reassuring concepts like user storyboards and critical user journeys "go out the window" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. It's like starting No Man's Sky without a clear story arc or mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Founders must stretch the muscle of helping users overcome inertia, creating narratives, and anchoring on a use case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. This gradually leads to more familiar territory of iterating on a defined use case, akin to colonizing a planet in No Man's Sky where problems become tangible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

### 2. Product Development Velocity

The [[building_successful_ai_projects_with_small_teams | product]] development process in an [[AI in enterprise and startups | AI]] startup is described as "gratifying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

*   **Rapid Iteration**: Unlike big tech where product launches require numerous departmental sign-offs, in a startup, one can go from an idea to a spec, design, testing, and release within hours or a few days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. This speed from concept to code and deployment is "exhilarating" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   **Velocity as "Table Stakes"**: In [[AI in enterprise and startups | AI]], velocity is not a "nice to have" but a fundamental requirement; inability to release quickly means being "out of the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. Opportunities for differentiation and gaining "power ups" emerge and disappear very rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, such as new protocols (MCP, agent-to-agent) or models (diffusion models) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. Reacting quickly to these breakthroughs is crucial for brand growth and cementing oneself in the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

### 3. Outreach, Awareness, and Adoption [[challenges_of_launching_an_ai_product | Challenges]]

This aspect has been the toughest and steepest learning curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

*   **Lack of Scaffolding**: Startups lack the built-in scaffolding for outreach, awareness, traffic, and adoption that big brands provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. The [[AI in enterprise and startups | AI]] space is saturated with "hype and meme wars," making it hard to distinguish signal from noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

> [!analogy] Crash Bandicoot / Mario Kart Analogy
> This experience is akin to playing Crash Bandicoot without boosters, or Mario Kart without red and green turtles to fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

*   **Importance of Advocates**: Unlike a big tech company where a tweet from a leader can generate instant awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>, a startup must find advocates and credible industry voices to speak on its behalf and act as "force multipliers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **Finding Allies**: To build brand awareness and traffic without a large company's established channels, startups must find allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. These can be other startups at a similar stage or slightly ahead, who see synergy in the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Strategies include partnering, cross-marketing, cross-selling, and even getting products listed in the integration documentation of other companies (e.g., BrowserBase) to drive traffic to their own properties like websites and GitHub repos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

Munir acknowledges that this area has been challenging, but also a massive learning curve, which he embraces as part of his personal growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

Munir is still learning and does not claim to be an expert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. He encourages viewers to reach out on LinkedIn for discussions and to consider starring Porsche [[AI in enterprise and startups | AI]]'s GitHub repository <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

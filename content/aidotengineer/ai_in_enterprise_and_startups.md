Enterprise adoption is driven by the maturation of [[AI implementation and best practices | AI]] models, which can now generate hypotheses, understand unstructured data, and perform at a PhD level in specific domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>. These models are also becoming more efficient, moving from data centers to local devices, offering greater control and lower latency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>.

Key shifts in enterprise [[AI strategies in financial technology companies | AI strategies]] include:
*   **From Pair Programming to Peer Programming**: Tools like GitHub Copilot are evolving from sidekicks to actual teammates in development workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:24">[00:38:24]</a>.
*   **From Software Factory to Agent Factory**: The focus is shifting from shipping binaries to shipping [[agentic_enterprise_and_ai | agents]] that can retrain, redeploy, and adapt post-launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:33">[00:38:33]</a>.
*   **Local AI**: Models are increasingly running on devices and at the edge, crucial for industries like [[ai_in_healthcare | healthcare]] due to compliance and privacy requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:10">[00:57:10]</a>. An example is a hospital system using local [[AI applications and customer success stories | AI]] to summarize longitudinal patient data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:35">[00:57:35]</a>.

Microsoft's Foundry platform supports this shift, enabling a "signals loop" where models are fine-tuned with real-world interactions for dramatic quality improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:52">[00:45:52]</a>. Dragon, a [[ai_in_healthcare | healthcare]] co-pilot, achieved an 83% character acceptance rate after fine-tuning with 650,000 interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:11">[00:46:11]</a>. Foundry also features "agentic RAG" (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), which improves accuracy by 40% on complex queries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:37">[00:47:37]</a>.

## AI in Startups

The scale of [[AI implementation and best practices | AI]] startups is "impressive, but has no visible means of support," metaphorically compared to the largest pillarless ballroom west of Las Vegas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. This highlights both the rapid growth and the inherent risks.

*   **Rapid Growth**: Companies are achieving $10-100 million in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) faster than in any previous technology revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:31">[01:04:31]</a>.

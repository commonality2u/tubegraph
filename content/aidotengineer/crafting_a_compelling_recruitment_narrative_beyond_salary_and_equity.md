Historically, recruitment narratives have heavily relied on offering attractive pay and equity packages to entice talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. However, this approach is becoming less effective and increasingly unsustainable, especially in the competitive AI landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

## The Shifting Landscape of Compensation

Data indicates a significant change in compensation trends:
*   From November 2022 to November 2024, the average tech salary only saw a 1.6% increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.
*   There has been a "precipitous decline" in the amount of equity granted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.
*   AI Engineers, while highly sought after, command a 5% salary premium and a 10 to 20% equity premium over other engineering roles, making them even more expensive to recruit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

This trend necessitates moving beyond salary as a sole selling point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.

### Declining Appeal of Equity

Equity, once a strong motivator, also faces challenges:
*   In Q2 2024, only 33% of people exercised their vested shares, a drop from 55% a couple of years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.
*   This decline is attributed to concerns about potentially high valuations, the cost of liquid capital required to exercise shares, and the rapidly shifting market in AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.
*   Consequently, equity can no longer be the sole additional incentive offered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.

## Components of a Strong Narrative

To attract top talent, particularly in AI, companies must broaden their recruitment narrative beyond financial incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>. Key elements to highlight include:

*   **A Close-Knit Environment:** Emphasize the opportunity to work closely with founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.
*   **Collaborative Teams:** Showcase a culture of teamwork and shared goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>.
*   **Speed and Lack of Friction:** Highlight the ability to quickly get things done without excessive bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>.
*   **A Big Mission:** Articulate a compelling vision that resonates with potential hires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.
*   **Growth Opportunities:** Detail paths for personal and professional development and career advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.
*   **Exploding Markets:** Position the company within a high-growth, dynamic industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>.
*   **Solving Complex Problems:** Appeal to individuals who are motivated by challenging and impactful work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>.

### Understanding Your Company's Story

Drawing an analogy from Kurt Vonnegut's concept of story shapes, companies must understand their own "arc" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. This means acknowledging past challenges, celebrating triumphs, and articulating a clear vision for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. This comprehensive narrative should not only highlight where the company is today but also its trajectory and potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>.

## Conclusion

In a crowded market where many companies are competing for the same talent, leveraging data to inform recruitment strategies, including [[rethinking_hiring_and_company_culture_with_ai | hiring and culture]], offers a significant edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>. Just as data is used to build products and models, it should be used to build effective teams, as the team itself is a company's most valuable product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.

This means:
*   Acknowledging the [[the_role_of_education_and_credentials_in_ai_recruitment | de-credentialization]] trend and filtering candidates based on experience rather than solely on academic requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>.
*   Understanding that [[the_significance_of_location_in_ai_hiring | location still matters]] and tracking talent movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>.
*   Utilizing data to identify the optimal [[timing_and_trends_in_talent_retention_and_movement | timing]] for outreach and assessing how long individuals stay at companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>.
*   Ultimately, all of these data-driven insights contribute to crafting a more compelling and effective recruitment narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.

## Who is Soumith Chintala?
Soumith Chintala is a co-founder of PyTorch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a> and currently works at Meta, which is the majority funder of the PyTorch project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. His work at Meta also involves robotics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## What is PyTorch?
PyTorch is a software that powers many [[AI models and training methods | AI APIs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. While many people in AI now use high-level APIs, PyTorch operates underneath, providing the foundational power for these systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## PyTorch's Purpose and Funding
PyTorch is described as a large project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a> primarily funded by Meta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The project is actively working on enabling local AI agents, particularly addressing technical challenges related to their implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>.

## PyTorch in the Real World
PyTorch is used in various applications, including:
*   **AI APIs** Many AI applications are powered by PyTorch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   **Local Model Inference** Projects like VLLM and SGLang, which are used to run local models, are built on top of PyTorch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
*   **Automotive Industry** Tesla cars utilize PyTorch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

## PyTorch's Future Focus
PyTorch is actively involved in solving the technical challenges necessary for the development and deployment of local AI agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. The project is hiring [[AI implementation and best practices | AI engineers]] with systems engineering experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.

Steven Moon, founder of Hai, advocates for a different approach to [[enterprise_ai_deployment_within_security_boundaries | Enterprise AI deployment]]. Instead of building parallel systems, he emphasizes [[Leveraging existing infrastructure for AI integration | leveraging decades of existing enterprise infrastructure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## The Challenge of AI Agent Deployment

The primary challenge in deploying AI agents and solutions isn't merely about powerful models or clever problem-solving. It's about deploying these digital workers in a way that respects an enterprise's existing security, compliance, and workflow frameworks that organizations have spent years perfecting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## The New Computing Paradigm: LLMs and AI Agents

AI engineers are at a unique juncture in computing history. For the first time, software applications can understand users directly and use the same interfaces as people do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a new computing paradigm where AI agents can:
*   Reason with requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>
*   Understand context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>
*   Interact naturally through existing channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>

### Avoiding Old Patterns

Despite this new paradigm, the rush to deploy AI agents often leads to reverting to old patterns: each new AI agent becomes another external system, another portal, another set of credentials, and another security review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This approach creates more barriers between users and the new capabilities AI can provide, rather than embracing the direct understanding that agents offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, observed a fundamental shift in business software, suggesting that traditional Software as a Service (SaaS) interfaces are becoming obsolete as AI agents become the primary way users interact with business systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Building new AI portals and dashboards recreates this very pattern that is becoming obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Enterprise AI Agents as Digital Employees

Enterprise AI agents should function like any other employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This means they should:
*   Follow security policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>
*   Use approved systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>
*   Stay within data boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>
*   Access only what's needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>
*   Be monitored and audited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>

### The Power of Existing Enterprise Systems

Enterprises already possess the necessary infrastructure for this approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>:
*   Secure compute environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>
*   Identity management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>
*   Data governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>
*   Compliance frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>
*   Audit capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>

These systems have been refined and hardened over decades, and many companies have their own private clouds where AI agents can operate within their security boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Modern AI infrastructure allows agents to run in private clouds, keep data within tenants, use existing security controls, leverage current workflows, and maintain complete oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. The technology exists to deploy AI with the same privacy controls applied to human employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

Creating new interfaces for AI agents risks solving "yesterday's problem" by building translation layers between humans and machines at a time when machines can directly understand us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. The question should be: "Could this capability be delivered through systems our users already know and trust?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

## Hai's Approach and the Future of IT

Hai, for example, leverages battle-tested platforms like Microsoft 365 and Azure, inheriting existing trust and infrastructure into their AI agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. This approach enables IT departments to provision AI agents exactly like human employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, captured this transformation by stating that "the IT department of every company is going to be the HR department of AI agents in the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. This means IT teams can:
*   Create agent accounts using existing Active Directory tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>
*   Apply standard security policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>
*   Set permissions through familiar interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>
*   Use existing audit and monitoring tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>

There's no new system to learn or special handling required, making AI agents another employee to manage through familiar tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

### Agent-to-Agent Communication and Scalability

[[Integration of mCP with AI Applications | Email opens up a powerful pattern for agent-to-agent communications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Just as humans use email to collaborate, AI agents can email each other to share data and coordinate work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. This ensures every interaction is:
*   Fully logged and auditable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>
*   Permissions enforced automatically through existing systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>
*   Data flows are transparent and controllable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>

This framework facilitates building observable and controllable AI systems at enterprise scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. While Microsoft's ecosystem was chosen by Hai, these patterns apply to other enterprise platforms like Google Workspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

## A Fundamental Shift in Enterprise AI Adoption

[[Strategies for effective AI implementation | Leveraging existing enterprise infrastructure]] frees AI engineers to focus on building new capabilities and solving novel problems, rather than reinventing infrastructure that already works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

The future of [[enhancing_existing_systems_with_ai_capabilities | Enterprise AI isn't about building new interfaces for agents]], but about [[enhancing_existing_systems_with_ai_capabilities | enhancing the systems that have been perfected over decades]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Enterprises possess hardened, secured, and refined systems like document management, internal messaging platforms, and workflow tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Now that software agents can directly understand human intent, each of these becomes a potential gateway for AI capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

This represents a fundamental shift in how enterprises approach AI adoption and application development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Instead of asking what new tools are needed, the question should be: "Which of our existing systems can we [[enhancing_existing_systems_with_ai_capabilities | enhance with AI agents]]?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a> The most powerful solution may be quiet intelligence added to tools customers already trust and use daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

The era of mandatory translation layers between humans and machines is ending, giving way to direct understanding and seamless AI collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

Heath Black, Managing Director of Product at SignalFire, discusses strategies for [[building_successful_ai_projects_with_small_teams | building]] and recruiting successful AI teams, drawing insights from SignalFire's proprietary AI/ML platform, Beacon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## SignalFire's Approach to VC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>
SignalFire operates as the first VC built like a tech company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Similar to how tech companies interview customers, SignalFire interviewed 500 founders to understand their pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Based on these insights, they built AI/ML tools and portfolio success teams to address common challenges like going to market, recruiting, building leadership skills, and launching products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

SignalFire's platform, Beacon, tracks over 650 million employees, 80 million companies, and 200 million open-source projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. This data is used to build proprietary ranking systems and market insights, powering the firm's speed and supporting invested companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. The focus for recruiting involves filtering the right people, finding them in the right locations, nailing the right timing, and closing them with the right narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

## 1. Filters: De-credentialization in AI Hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>
A significant trend in AI over the past decade is a stark "de-credentialization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. AI startups are increasingly hiring engineers without PhDs or prestigious schooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

*   **Decline in Traditional Credentials**:
    *   In 2015, 27% of engineer hires were from top schools, and 16% had PhDs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
    *   By 2023, these numbers dropped to 15% and 7% respectively, representing about a 50% decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
    *   Even for research scientists, less than half (about 40%) have advanced degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
*   **Shift in Focus**: This shift reflects a market change from focusing on foundational ML research to applying models to real-world usage, emphasizing ML Ops, product experience, and understanding user interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   **Talent Mobility**: Historically, AI talent was centered at large tech companies like Google, Uber, Meta, and Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Over time, this talent has concentrated into what SignalFire calls the "AI V-League," which includes companies like OpenAI and Anthropic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Large tech companies are now actively recruiting from these AI V-League companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

    *   Knowing where people are coming from and where they are going is crucial for filtering the right candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. For example, OpenAI has a positive flow of talent from DeepMind, while Cohere has a negative trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

### Takeaways for Filtering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>
*   Work experience now far surpasses education as the main aspect to consider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Focus on a candidate's body of work, including open-source contributions and projects built outside of class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   Assess whether a PhD researcher is truly needed for a role, or if an experienced engineer would suffice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
*   Consider removing or softening academic requirements from job postings to ensure the top of the funnel attracts candidates with relevant experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

## 2. Location: Where AI Talent Concentrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>
Despite debates about San Francisco's decline, data indicates it is not "dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

*   **San Francisco's Continued Dominance**:
    *   San Francisco makes up about 29% of all startup engineers, slightly down from 33% in 2013 but ticking up since 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
    *   For big tech, 50% of engineers still reside in the San Francisco Bay Area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.
*   **AI-Specific Concentrations**: San Francisco leads the pack for AI talent, with 35% of all AI engineers residing there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Seattle accounts for about 22%, and New York for 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. San Francisco alone has more AI engineers than Seattle and New York combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Funding Concentration**: These cities are "punching above their weight" in AI hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. San Francisco accounts for nearly 38% of all early-stage funding into AI startups, despite only having 26% of all early-stage funding in the U.S. total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

### Takeaways for Location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>
*   Data, not social media, determines market status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. Location still matters even in a distributed world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
*   San Francisco, Seattle, and New York are the premier locations for AI talent today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
*   Monitor location and funding markets to identify where talent and capital are flowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

## 3. Timing: Identifying Opportunities and Impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>
Finding the right person depends on talent and timing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. Timing involves finding people when they are most likely to leave and finding those who would up-level a team at a specific company stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

*   **Retention Rates**: Analyzing retention rates of AI V-League companies can help identify when individuals are likely to be "poachable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. For example, Anthropic has a 66% 4-year retention rate, while Perplexity hovers around 43-44% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.
*   **Generational Behavior**: Different generations exhibit different job mobility patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. In 2023, nearly 27% of Gen Z left their jobs, more than double the rate of Gen X <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. Within four years of graduating, Gen Z averages 2.2 jobs, compared to 1.1 for Gen X <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. This can be partly attributed to Gen Z's slower promotion rates, layoff market conditions, and a greater penchant for taking risks and betting on themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.
*   **Historical Composition Tool**: SignalFire's "historical composition" tool provides snapshots of admired companies at different points in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. It shows organizational structures, key hires (e.g., sales leaders who scaled from $1 million to $10 million, or the first three engineers who shipped a key product), and helps identify candidates' risk profiles, motivations, and potential as "10x hires" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

### Takeaways for Timing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>
*   Understand timing from both an outreach and impact standpoint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.
*   Know when competitors or admired companies are likely to lose people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. Track employee profiles for changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.
*   Study job change patterns across generations or population segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.
*   Identify when people join and leave companies to find potential "10xers" and candidates likely to join a company at your stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.

## 4. Narrative: Beyond Pay and Equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>
Heath Black refers to Kurt Vonnegut's concept of story shapes to explain how a company's narrative is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. A company needs to understand its triumphs, current position, and future trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.

*   **Declining Reliance on Traditional Incentives**: Historically, pay and equity were the primary components of a company's narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. However, this is changing:
    *   From November 2022 to November 2024, the average tech salary only increased by 1.6%, with a sharp decline in equity granted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>.
    *   AI Engineers are a "hot ticket," commanding a 5% salary premium and a 10-20% equity premium over other engineering roles, making them even more expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.
    *   Reliance on salary as a sole selling point is no longer viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>.
    *   Equity is also a less reliable draw; in Q2 2024, only 33% of people exercised vested shares, down from 55% a couple of years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>. This is due to concerns about high valuations, the cost of liquid capital, and the rapidly shifting AI market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>.

*   **Essential Narrative Elements**: Companies must offer more than just money and equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>. Key elements for a compelling narrative include:
    *   A close-knit environment with opportunities to work with founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.
    *   Collaborative teams and minimal friction for getting work done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>.
    *   A big mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>.
    *   Opportunities for personal growth and career advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.
    *   Exploding markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.
    *   Solving complex problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>.

### Takeaways for Narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>
*   Understand these non-monetary aspects of your company to avoid relying solely on salary and equity in your narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>.

## Conclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>
In a competitive landscape where many companies are "fishing in the same engineering pond," recruiting data provides a crucial edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. Just as data is used to build products and models, it should be used to build teams, as a team is a company's most valuable product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>.

Key points for recruiting [[best_practices_for_implementing_ai_in_teams | AI teams]]:
*   **Filter accordingly**: Acknowledge the "de-credentialization" trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>.
*   **Watch where people move**: Location still matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>.
*   **Identify the right time**: Use data to determine optimal outreach times and understand employee tenure at companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>.
*   **Craft a better narrative**: Build a compelling story beyond just compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.

When developing AI models, particularly for speech AI, NVIDIA focuses on robust fundamentals and leverages available resources, including open-source tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. This approach supports the goal of maximizing data utilization and ingestion speed across various settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

## [[Tool Usage and Development in AI Frameworks | Open-Source Toolkit for Model Training]]

A key [[Using tools and function calls with AI SDK | open-source tool]] utilized for model training is the **Nemo research toolkit** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. This library is publicly available for anyone in the community to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

The Nemo research toolkit offers several features that enhance the efficiency and scalability of AI development:
*   **GPU Maximalization** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>
*   **Data Bucketing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>
*   **High-speed Data Loading** via the Latte backend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>

These features allow developers to [[Leveraging AI Tools for Efficiency and Scalability | maximize data processing and speed]] during model training and [[Building and scaling AI use cases with OpenAI | fine-tune models]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. The use of such open-source frameworks demonstrates an approach that combines in-house development with community-contributed resources, differing from reliance solely on [[Inhouse AI development vs thirdparty solutions | third-party solutions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

Beyond tools, the development process also incorporates both open-source and proprietary data. Open-source data specifically aids in focusing on variety and domain shift in models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

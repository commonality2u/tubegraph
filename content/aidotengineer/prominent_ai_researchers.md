In a survey of 100 [[state_of_ai_engineering | AI engineers]] conducted for "Frontier Feud," participants were asked to name the most influential AI researchers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. While not all guesses made it onto the top eight answers, the discussion highlighted several prominent figures in the field.

## Surveyed Influential AI Researchers

The top eight answers from the survey for "most influential AI researcher" included:

*   **Jeff Hinton** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>
*   **Yann LeCun** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>
*   **Andrew Ng** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>
*   **Fei-Fei Li** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>

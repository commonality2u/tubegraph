The [[Model Context Protocol mCP Overview | Model Context Protocol (mCP)]] ecosystem, while exciting, presents several challenges specifically for developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. These issues range from infrastructure concerns to tooling and economic models.

## Hosting Challenges
Despite advancements like Streambo HTTP transport making it easier to find hosting platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>, hosting [[Model Context Protocol mCP Overview | MCPs]] remains a significant challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Developers must contend with issues such as stable sessions and resumability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## Lacking Developer Tooling
Developer tooling in the [[Model Context Protocol mCP Overview | MCP]] space is currently quite limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. While a basic [[Model Context Protocol mCP Overview | MCP]] inspector is provided by the official [[Model Context Protocol mCP Overview | MCP]] repository for testing tools and checking prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>, many open questions persist for developers, including:
*   How to design the most effective [[Model Context Protocol mCP Overview | MCPs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   How to predict if a specific tool will be utilized by an agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   How to create the optimal agent experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

## Distribution Issues
A key problem for developers is the distribution of their [[Model Context Protocol mCP Overview | MCPs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. There is a lack of clear mechanisms for an [[Model Context Protocol mCP Overview | MCP]] to be discovered once it's created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

## Observability
Once an [[Model Context Protocol mCP Overview | MCP]] is deployed and in use, developers face difficulties in improving it due to limited observability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

## Monetization
A significant unanswered question for developers is how to generate revenue from their [[Model Context Protocol mCP Overview | MCPs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

## Addressing the Challenges
[[Smitherys role in solving MCP challenges | Smithery]] was founded in December 2024 to address these [[Challenges in the MCP ecosystem | challenges in the MCP ecosystem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. The company aims to become an "AI gateway" to foster and orchestrate the growing landscape of AI-native services for AI agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. The ultimate goal is to enable an agent experience where AI agents can access and utilize thousands of curated [[Model Context Protocol mCP Overview | MCPs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. The future internet is predicted to be dominated by tool calls rather than clicks, emphasizing the importance of the agent experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

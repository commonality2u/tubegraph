Meta learning is a core principle in the development of Windsurf, an [[agentic_editors_in_software_development | AI agent-powered editor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This concept enables Windsurf to adapt and remember aspects of a user's codebase, personal preferences, and organizational guidelines over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

## Why Meta Learning?

While frontier [[large_language_models_in_code_generation | LLMs]] are highly capable and can write large amounts of correct code, they often lack the specific exposure and education that human engineers have acquired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. They don't inherently know how an individual or a company writes code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. Effective developers remember what they are told, and Windsurf aims to model this behavior for [[future_of_ai_in_coding | AI to write and maintain projects]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.

The goal is to reduce the need for repeated prompting, allowing the [[large_language_models_in_code_generation | AI]] to feel like a seamless extension of the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

## Features Powering Meta Learning

Windsurf implements several features to achieve meta learning:

*   **Autogenerated Memories**
    Over time, Windsurf builds a memory bank of user actions and preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. Users can explicitly instruct Windsurf to remember specific details, like `tailn` version 4 or React version 19, and these will be remembered indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.
    *   **Inferred Learning:** Windsurf can also implicitly learn from an architecture overview or by analyzing files and routes, committing project details like available endpoints to memory for future reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.
*   **Auto-Learned Documentation**
    Windsurf automatically identifies the packages a user is utilizing, often from `package.json` files, and implicitly searches the web for relevant documentation that matches specific versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.
*   **Custom [[finetuning_language_models_with_mcp | MCP]] Servers**
    Users can integrate their preferred tools by plugging in custom [[finetuning_language_models_with_mcp | MCP]] servers, allowing Windsurf to adapt to their specific workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
*   **Whitelisting and Blacklisting Commands**
    Users can specify commands that the agent should or should not run without explicit approval, allowing for fine-grained control and learning of user safety preferences over time (e.g., "never run an `RM` command without my approval") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>.

## The Future of Meta Learning

Windsurf's developers believe that by the end of 2025, nearly all information typically provided in a "rules file" will be inferred directly from the codebase or usage patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. The vision is for every Windsurf instance to be personalized to its user, requiring only one explicit instruction to be remembered permanently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.

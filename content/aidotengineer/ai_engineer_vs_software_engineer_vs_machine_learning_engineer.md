The field of [[evolution_of_ai_engineering_and_tools | AI engineering]] is an evolving discipline, attempting to carve out its own identity amidst established roles like machine learning (ML) engineers and software engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

## Evolution of the AI Engineer Role

The [[state_of_ai_engineering | state of the AI engineering]] industry has been a recurring theme at AI Engineer Summits. Previous summits have documented:
*   The rise of the [[evolution_of_ai_engineering_and_tools | AI engineer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.
*   The identification of three types of [[evolution_of_ai_engineering_and_tools | AI engineers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.
*   The maturation and spread of the [[evolution_of_ai_engineering_and_tools | AI engineering]] discipline across various fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

## Perspectives on the AI Engineer's Identity

There is current resistance from two sides regarding the definition of an [[evolution_of_ai_engineering_and_tools | AI engineer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>:

*   **Machine Learning (ML) Engineer Point of View**: From an ML perspective, an [[evolution_of_ai_engineering_and_tools | AI engineer]] is often seen as largely an ML engineer with the addition of "a few prompts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.
*   **Software Engineer Point of View**: From a [[impact_of_ai_coding_agents_on_software_engineering | software engineering]] perspective, an [[evolution_of_ai_engineering_and_tools | AI engineer]] is considered primarily a [[impact_of_ai_coding_agents_on_software_engineering | software engineer]] who calls "a few LLM APIs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

The speaker notes that while currently, [[evolution_of_ai_engineering_and_tools | AI engineering]] might be described as "90% [[impact_of_ai_coding_agents_on_software_engineering | software engineering]] 10% [[evolution_of_ai_engineering_and_tools | AI]]", this balance is expected to shift, with [[evolution_of_ai_engineering_and_tools | AI engineering]] emerging as its own distinct discipline over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

### Linguistic Differences

Differences in language also highlight the distinct focuses of these fields:
*   **Machine Learning (ML) Engineers**: May use terms like "test time compute" because the primary reason to run inference for them is for testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.
*   **AI Engineers**: May use "inference time compute" to emphasize their focus on actual inference processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.
*   **Software Engineers**: May refer to "reasoning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.

## The Evolving Role of the AI Engineer

The job of an [[evolution_of_ai_engineering_and_tools | AI engineer]] is now evolving towards building agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a>. This parallels how ML engineers build models and [[impact_of_ai_coding_agents_on_software_engineering | software engineers]] build software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:00">[11:04:00]</a>. This shift indicates a specialization within the broader engineering landscape, focusing on the development and deployment of agentic [[limitations_of_current_ai_models_in_software_engineering | AI models]].

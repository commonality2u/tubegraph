This article summarizes key insights and discussions from a "Frontier Feud" event, where 100 [[challenges_and_innovations_in_ai_engineering | AI Engineers]] were surveyed on various topics related to the AI industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. The event highlighted several [[ai_technological_advancements | AI technological advancements]], [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_ai_adoption | challenges and opportunities in AI adoption]], and future trends in the field.

## Emerging [[AI Technological Advancements | AI Technological Advancements]] and Trends

Participants shared their "tech hot takes" which touched on future trends and developments in the [[ai_in_enterprise_applications | AI]] space:

*   **Shift in AI Model Training**: A prediction was made that at least one of the current five major entities training big models today will cease to do so by the end of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This suggests potential consolidation or strategic shifts among leading AI developers.
*   **On-Device and Smaller Models**: It is projected that within a year and a half, the majority of deployed [[ai_in_enterprise_applications | AI models]] will be on-device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. This trend favors smaller models that are orchestrated together and hyperspecialized for specific tasks, moving away from sole reliance on larger, cloud-based models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. This represents a significant [[applications_and_future_of_ai_technology | future of AI technology]] trend.
*   **AI for Interpersonal Interactions**: A "hot take" suggested that dating apps in the future might involve [[ai_in_enterprise_applications | AI]] agents dating each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Another prediction indicated that future conversations would involve at least two other bots in the room, suggesting a more multi-agent interaction model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   **Biological AI**: A long-term perspective suggested that Transformers might not be the final AI architecture, with future models potentially being built using biological materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

## Challenges and Considerations in AI

The survey questions to 100 [[challenges_and_innovations_in_ai_engineering | AI Engineers]] revealed several key challenges and considerations within the industry.

### Top Considerations When Choosing an [[ai_in_enterprise_applications | AI Model]]

When selecting an [[ai_in_enterprise_applications | AI model]], the top considerations for engineers include:

*   **Cost/Price**: This was identified as the number one consideration, which surprised many in the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. This highlights a significant [[enterprise_ai_and_roi_challenges | enterprise AI and ROI challenge]].
*   **Latency**: The speed of the model is also a crucial factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.
*   **Accuracy/Performance**: Evaluating benchmark scores and overall performance is important for model selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
*   **Capabilities**: The specific functionalities and abilities of the model are a key decision point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.
*   **Open Source vs. Closed Source**: The licensing model also plays a role in the decision-making process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

### Buzzwords Engineers Are Tired of Hearing

[[challenges_and_opportunities_in_ai_and_agent_capabilities | AI Engineers]] expressed fatigue with certain buzzwords:

*   **AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)**: This was the most commonly cited buzzword that engineers are tired of hearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.
*   **Agents**: Another frequently mentioned buzzword <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.
*   **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: This term is also causing fatigue among engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.
*   **Prompt Engineering**: This term was also listed as something engineers are tired of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.

### Jobs Most at Risk of AI Disruption

When asked about jobs most at risk from [[ai_in_enterprise_applications | AI]] disruption, the top answers were:

*   **Data Entry**: Identified as the number one job at risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>.
*   **Software Engineers**: This profession was also listed among the top three at risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.
*   **Content Creation/Writing**: This broader category encompassing artists and writers was also deemed at risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.

### Biggest Nightmares for [[Challenges and Innovations in AI Engineering | AI Engineers]]

The survey revealed the biggest nightmares for [[challenges_and_innovations_in_ai_engineering | AI Engineers]] at 2 AM:

*   **Model Outage**: An outage of the [[ai_in_enterprise_applications | AI model]] was the top nightmare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>.
*   **Hardware Failure/Info Problem**: Issues with hardware or information were also a significant concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.
*   **Cold Email from a VC**: A humorous but relatable nightmare for engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>.

### Industry Most Benefiting from AI

Healthcare was identified as an industry that would benefit the most from [[ai_in_enterprise_applications | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>.

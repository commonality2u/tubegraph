Mounir Mouawad is the CEO and co-founder of Porsche AI, an [[tiny_teams_in_ai_startups | AI startup]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. He shares his experiences transitioning from big tech to founding his own company, particularly for those considering a similar leap or who are in the early stages of an [[challenges_of_starting_an_ai_company | AI company]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Professional Background
Before founding Porsche AI, Mouawad held various product roles in big tech companies, always based in London <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>:
*   **Amazon:** Launched the deals program in the UK, used for events like Black Friday and Prime Day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   **Google:** Launched and expanded Google Pay across 30 markets in EMEA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   **Stripe:** Led the Bank as a Service initiative for EMEA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## The Decision to Start a Company
Mouawad always harbored a desire to "do my own thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Eventually, he reached a point where he felt compelled to take the plunge, describing it as feeling like "nothing else made sense anymore" and like a "copout" if he didn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Founding Porsche AI
In June of the previous year, Mouawad co-founded Porsche AI with Emma, whom he met at Stripe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Porsche AI is an open-source SDK designed for building production agents, with a specific focus on regulated industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Lessons Learned from Starting an AI Company
Mouawad shares key insights from his experience:

### [[user_problems_and_discovery_in_ai_startups | User Problems and Discovery in AI Startups]]
The process of identifying and understanding user problems in the AI space is significantly different from traditional product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>:
*   **Undefined Problems:** Unlike conventional problems with established shapes and adjacencies (e.g., payment products at Stripe), AI user problems are often emergent properties of the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Users might know they want to use AI and see opportunities, but they don't know their specific problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **Rapid Change:** What is technologically possible in AI changes very quickly, making traditional three-to-six-month roadmaps obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   **Hypothesis-Driven Iteration:** Startups must make directional bets and iterate very quickly by releasing products and observing user reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. This hypothesis-driven, deliberate iteration provides the necessary focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Creating Narratives:** Conventional user storyboards and critical user journeys are less effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Founders must help users overcome initial inertia, create narratives around specific use cases, and work collaboratively to anchor on a problem to refine the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. This process eventually leads to more tangible and scoped problem spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

### Gratifying Product Development and Velocity
The product development process in an [[tiny_teams_in_ai_startups | AI startup]] can be highly gratifying due to its speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.
*   **Rapid Iteration:** It's possible to go from a new technological standard (like MCP) to an idea, product spec, design, testing, and release within days or even hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. This quick transition from concept to deployed code is exhilarating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Velocity as a Baseline:** In AI, velocity is not just a "nice-to-have" but a "table stakes" requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
*   **Capitalizing on Opportunities:** Opportunities that provide a competitive edge (like new protocols or models such as agent-to-agent protocol or diffusion models) emerge and disappear quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. The ability to react swiftly and build products around these breakthroughs is crucial for brand growth and cementing a position in the developer or user community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

### Outreach, Awareness, and Adoption Challenges
This area has been the toughest and steepest learning curve for Mouawad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
*   **Lack of Scaffolding:** Unlike big tech, startups lack the inherent advantages of established brands for outreach, awareness, traffic, and adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   **Signal vs. Noise:** The AI space is characterized by intense hype and "meme wars," making it difficult to distinguish signal from noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.
*   **Reliance on People:** People primarily follow other people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Without the power of a major brand's endorsement (like a tweet from a founder), startups must actively find and engage credible industry voices and advocates to act as force multipliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **Strategic Partnerships:** To build brand awareness and drive traffic without a large corporate infrastructure, it is essential to find allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. These can be other startups at a similar stage or slightly ahead, seeking synergy for partnerships, cross-marketing, and cross-selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Integrating products into the documentation of other companies (e.g., BrowserBase) can serve as a significant channel for discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

Mouawad acknowledges that he is still learning and not an expert, with the purpose of sharing his experiences for inspiration and discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. He invites engagement and connection on LinkedIn for further discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. He also encourages support for Porsche AI by starring their GitHub repository <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

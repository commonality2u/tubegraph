From: [[khanacademy]] <br/> 

The primary goal when [[understanding_mathematical_equations | solving an equation]] is to [[Isolating the variable in an equation | isolate the variable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This means manipulating the equation until the variable (e.g., 'x') is by itself on one side of the equals sign, like "x = something" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Once this is achieved, the equation is considered solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Core Principle: Maintaining Equality

To [[Isolating the variable in an equation | isolate the variable]], various operations are performed on both sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The fundamental rule is that whatever operation is applied to one side of the equation must also be applied to the other side to maintain balance and equality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. If you [[understanding_mathematical_equations | visualize what's happening]], it becomes common sense what operations are allowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> While visualizing the equation (e.g., as collections of 'x's and '1's) can aid understanding, it's not necessary for [[using_algebraic_steps_to_solve_equations | solving the problem]]; only the [[using_algebraic_steps_to_solve_equations | algebraic steps]] are required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Example: Solving a Multi-Step Linear Equation

Let's solve the equation: `2x + 3 = 5x - 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>

This equation involves variables on both sides and constant terms being added and [[using_subtraction_in_equations | subtracted]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

### Step 1: Consolidate Variable Terms

The first step is to gather all the variable terms (x's) on one side of the equation. It's often helpful to move them to the side where they will remain positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

*   **Operation**: [[using_subtraction_in_equations | Subtract 2x]] from both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
    *   (2x + 3) - 2x = (5x - 2) - 2x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>
    *   3 = 3x - 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>

### Step 2: Consolidate Constant Terms

Next, move all the constant terms to the opposite side of the equation from the variables.

*   **Operation**: Add 2 to both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
    *   3 + 2 = (3x - 2) + 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>
    *   5 = 3x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>

### Step 3: Isolate the Variable

The variable 'x' is currently being [[multiplication_and_division_in_equations | multiplied by 3]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. To [[Isolating the variable in an equation | isolate]] it, perform the inverse operation.

*   **Operation**: [[dividing_to_solve_equations | Divide both sides]] by 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
    *   5 / 3 = 3x / 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>
    *   5/3 = x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>

### Final Solution

The solution is `x = 5/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. This can also be written as a mixed number: `x = 1 2/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. It is completely acceptable for the variable to be on the right-hand side of the equation; `5/3 = x` is equivalent to `x = 5/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

> [!TIP]
> You can always check your answer by substituting the solution back into the [[solving_linear_equations | original equation]] to verify that both sides are equal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

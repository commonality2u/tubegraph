[[basic_overview_of_probability | Probability]] provides a way to quantify the chances of fundamentally random events occurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:17">[01:11:17]</a>. It helps describe the likelihood of an outcome when the exact result is unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:22">[01:20:22]</a>.

## The Fair Coin
A "fair coin" is defined as a coin that has an equal chance of landing on one side or the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. This means its sides are equal, their weight is the same on either side, and it is not more likely to land on one side than the other when flipped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. It is [[equally_likely_possibilities_in_probability | equally likely]] to land on heads or tails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>.

### Calculating Probability with a Fair Coin
To [[calculating_probability_of_an_event | calculate the probability]] of an event, a common method is to consider the ratio of desired outcomes to the total number of [[equally_likely_possibilities_in_probability | equally likely possibilities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:30">[01:30:30]</a>:

$$ P(\text{Event}) = \frac{\text{Number of possibilities that meet conditions}}{\text{Number of equally likely possibilities}} $$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>

For a fair coin flip, there are two [[equally_likely_possibilities_in_probability | equally likely possibilities]]: heads or tails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. The probability of getting heads is:

$$ P(\text{Heads}) = \frac{\text{1 (Heads)}}{\text{2 (Heads, Tails)}} = \frac{1}{2} $$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>

This can also be expressed as 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

## Conceptualizing Probability through Repetition
Another way to understand [[basic_probability_concepts | probability]] is by imagining an experiment, like flipping a coin, being performed many, many times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. If the experiment were run an infinite number of times, the percentage of outcomes that meet a specific condition (e.g., getting heads) would converge to the probability of that event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. For a fair coin, approximately 50% of an infinite number of flips would result in heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>. The more times an experiment is conducted, the closer the observed results will be to the theoretical probability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.

## Probability Examples
### [[probability_of_rolling_a_die | Rolling a Die]]
For a fair six-sided die, there are six [[equally_likely_possibilities_in_probability | equally likely possibilities]]: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.

*   **Probability of rolling a 1**:
    $$ P(\text{1}) = \frac{\text{1 (the number 1)}}{\text{6 (total sides)}} = \frac{1}{6} $$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>

*   **Probability of rolling a 1 or a 6**:
    $$ P(\text{1 or 6}) = \frac{\text{2 (the numbers 1 or 6)}}{\text{6 (total sides)}} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3} $$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>

*   **Probability of rolling a 2 AND a 3 (on a single roll)**:
    This is an example of mutually exclusive events, meaning they cannot happen at the same time on a single roll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>. Therefore, the probability is 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>.

*   **Probability of getting an even number**:
    The even numbers on a die are 2, 4, and 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>.
    $$ P(\text{Even number}) = \frac{\text{3 (numbers 2, 4, 6)}}{\text{6 (total sides)}} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} $$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>

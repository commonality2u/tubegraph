Logarithms are fundamentally about determining what power a base number must be raised to in order to obtain another number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This concept is the inverse of exponentiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. For example, if you start with 2 and want to know what power it must be raised to to get 16, the answer is 4 (2 to the 4th power equals 16) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Logarithm Notation and Equivalence

[[logarithm_notation_and_conversion | Logarithms]] are denoted using "log" with a base subscript <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. The expression `log base b of x = y` is equivalent to the exponential statement `b^y = x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

For instance:
*   The statement `log base 2 of 16 = x` asks, "what power do you need to raise 2 to, to get 16?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
*   The answer, in this case, is `x = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## Evaluating Logarithmic Expressions

[[evaluating_logarithmic_expressions | Evaluating logarithmic expressions]] involves finding the exponent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

*   **Example 1: `log base 3 of 81`** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>
    *   This asks for the power you must raise 3 to, to get 81 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
    *   `3^1 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>
    *   `3^2 = 9` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>
    *   `3^3 = 27` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>
    *   `3^4 = 81` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>
    *   Therefore, `log base 3 of 81 = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

*   **Example 2: `log base 6 of 216`** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>
    *   This asks for the power you must raise 6 to, to get 216 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
    *   `6^1 = 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>
    *   `6^2 = 36` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>
    *   `6^3 = 216` (since 36 * 6 = 216) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>
    *   Therefore, `log base 6 of 216 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

*   **Example 3: `log base 2 of 64`** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>
    *   This asks for the exponent you must raise 2 to, to get 64 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
    *   Counting powers of 2: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
    *   `2^6 = 64` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>
    *   Therefore, `log base 2 of 64 = 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

## Special Property: Logarithm of One

One important property of logarithms is related to the value 1.

*   **Example: `log base 100 of 1`** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>
    *   This asks: "What power do I have to raise 100 to, to get 1?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>
    *   If `100^x = 1`, then `x` must be 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
    *   This is because any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 equals 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
    *   Therefore, `log base 100 of 1 = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

*   **General Rule:** `log base b of 1 = 0` for any valid base `b` (where `b` is not 0) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. This is an application of the [[properties_of_zeros_in_equations | properties of zeros]] in exponents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

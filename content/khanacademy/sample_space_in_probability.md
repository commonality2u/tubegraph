In the study of [[introduction_to_probability | probability]], a key concept is the **sample space**, which refers to the set of all possible [[events_and_outcomes_in_probability | outcomes]] of a given trial or experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. It's considered a "fancy word for just a simple idea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## Core Concepts

*   **Trial**: The action being performed, such as picking a marble out of a bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: A single result of a trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Possible Outcomes**: All the potential results that can occur during a trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The collection of these makes up the sample space.
*   **Event**: The specific [[events_and_outcomes_in_probability | outcome]] or set of [[events_and_outcomes_in_probability | outcomes]] one is interested in, for which the probability is being measured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   **Probability**: A measurement of the likelihood that a specific [[events_and_outcomes_in_probability | event]] will happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. It is calculated by determining how many [[events_and_outcomes_in_probability | outcomes]] satisfy the desired [[events_and_outcomes_in_probability | event]] divided by the total number of possible [[events_and_outcomes_in_probability | outcomes]] in the sample space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Example: Marbles in a Bag

Consider a bag containing marbles with the following distribution:
*   3 yellow marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>
*   2 red marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>
*   2 green marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>
*   1 blue marble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>

To find the probability of picking a yellow marble, one must first identify the sample space.

### Determining the Sample Space

The "trial" is picking a marble from the bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The possible [[events_and_outcomes_in_probability | outcomes]] are each individual marble that could be picked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

*   Yellow marbles: Y1, Y2, Y3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>
*   Red marbles: R1, R2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   Green marbles: G1, G2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>
*   Blue marbles: B1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>

The total number of possible [[events_and_outcomes_in_probability | outcomes]] (the size of the sample space) is the sum of all marbles: 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 8 marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### Calculating Probability

If the [[events_and_outcomes_in_probability | event]] in question is "picking a yellow marble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, then the number of [[events_and_outcomes_in_probability | outcomes]] that satisfy this [[events_and_outcomes_in_probability | event]] is 3 (since there are 3 yellow marbles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

The probability (P) of picking a yellow marble is therefore:
P(Yellow) = (Number of yellow marbles) / (Total number of marbles)
P(Yellow) = 3 / 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>

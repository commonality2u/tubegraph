In [[basic_probability_concepts | probability]], the **sample space** is defined as the set of all possible outcomes for a given trial or experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. It encompasses every potential result that could occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. While the term "sample space" might sound complex, it simply refers to the complete list of possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.

## Components of a Sample Space

The individual elements within a sample space represent each distinct possible outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.

### Example: Picking Marbles

Consider a bag containing marbles of different colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>:
*   3 yellow marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>
*   2 red marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>
*   2 green marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>
*   1 blue marble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>

If you perform a "trial" by picking one marble from the bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>, the sample space consists of all the individual marbles you could potentially pick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

*   **Possible Outcomes:** Yellow1, Yellow2, Yellow3, Red1, Red2, Green1, Green2, Blue1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

In this scenario, there are 8 distinct possible outcomes, meaning the size of the sample space is 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.

## Sample Space and Probability Calculation

The sample space plays a crucial role in calculating the [[basic_probability_concepts | probability]] of an event occurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. The [[basic_probability_concepts | probability]] of an event is generally calculated as:

$\text{Probability of Event} = \frac{\text{Number of outcomes satisfying the event}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes (size of sample space)}}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>

For instance, to find the [[basic_probability_concepts | probability]] of picking a yellow marble from the bag:
*   **Number of outcomes satisfying the event (picking yellow):** 3 (since there are 3 yellow marbles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>
*   **Total number of possible outcomes (size of sample space):** 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>

Therefore, the [[basic_probability_concepts | probability]] of picking a yellow marble is 3/8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> The term "trial" refers to the act of performing the experiment, such as picking a marble out of the bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. The "event" is the specific outcome or set of outcomes you are interested in, like picking a yellow marble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

This article serves as an [[introduction_to_geometry_terminology | introduction to the language and fundamental concepts]] used in geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## What is Geometry?
The word "geometry" itself provides insight into its meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. The root word "geo" is seen in terms like geography and geology, and refers to the earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The "metry" part, also found in [[introduction_to_basic_trigonometry | trigonometry]] and the metric system, comes from "measurement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Therefore, geometry literally means "earth measurement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

Geometry is a broad subject that encompasses the study and understanding of how shapes, space, and visually mathematical concepts relate to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. It includes learning about lines, triangles, circles, angles, patterns, and three-dimensional shapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Basic Geometric Elements

### Point
A point is defined as a specific dot or position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   **Properties**: A point is purely a position; one cannot move on a point. If you move in any direction, you are no longer at that point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   **Dimensions**: A point has [[concept_of_dimensions_in_geometry | zero dimensions]] because you cannot travel in any direction while staying on the point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Labeling**: Points are typically labeled with capital letters, such as Point A, Point B, Point C, or Point D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### Line Segment
A line segment consists of all points connecting two specific points, along a straight path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **Properties**: A line segment has a finite length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. In pure geometry, it has no width, only length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   **Dimensions**: A line segment is a [[concept_of_dimensions_in_geometry | one-dimensional]] object, as you can only move back and forth along its length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   **Endpoints**: The two specific points that define the line segment are called its endpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Labeling**: A line segment is labeled using its two endpoints with a line drawn above them, for example, $\text{AB}$ or $\text{BA}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. The length of a line segment is denoted by writing the endpoints without the line above, e.g., $\text{AB} = 5$ units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

### Ray
A ray starts at one point and extends infinitely in one direction, passing through another point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
*   **Properties**: A ray has a starting point but no end point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Dimensions**: Like a line segment, a ray is a [[concept_of_dimensions_in_geometry | one-dimensional]] figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   **Vertex**: The starting point of a ray is called its vertex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   **Labeling**: A ray is denoted by its starting point followed by another point on the ray, with an arrow drawn above them indicating the direction of infinite extension, e.g., $\text{AD}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. The order of the letters matters for rays; $\text{AD}$ is different from $\text{DA}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

### Line
A line is a straight path that extends infinitely in both directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.
*   **Properties**: A line never ends; it keeps going indefinitely in either direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   **Dimensions**: A line is a [[concept_of_dimensions_in_geometry | one-dimensional]] object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
*   **Labeling**: A line is specified by two points it passes through, with a line and arrows on both ends drawn above them, e.g., $\text{EF}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

## Additional Terminology

### Collinear Points
Points are said to be [[understanding_colinear_points_and_midpoints | collinear]] if they all lie on the same straight line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. For example, if points X, Y, and Z are on the same line, they are collinear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

### Midpoint
The [[understanding_colinear_points_and_midpoints | midpoint]] of a line segment is the point that is exactly halfway between its two endpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. For instance, if the distance between X and Z is equal to the distance between Z and Y, and they are collinear, then Z is the midpoint of line segment XY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

### Planes
A plane is a two-dimensional flat surface that extends infinitely in all directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.
*   **Properties**: On a plane, one can move backwards and forwards in two different directions (e.g., right/left and up/down) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
*   **Dimensions**: A plane has [[concept_of_dimensions_in_geometry | two dimensions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. A physical screen or page is an example of a two-dimensional object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

## Summary of Dimensions
*   **Zero Dimensions**: A **point** has no dimensions; you cannot move on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **One Dimension**: A **line segment**, **ray**, or **line** are one-dimensional; you can only move back and forth along a single direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **Two Dimensions**: A **plane** has two dimensions; you can move in two independent directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.
*   **Three Dimensions**: Our physical space is three-dimensional, allowing movement in three independent directions (e.g., left/right, up/down, in/out of a screen) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. In higher mathematics, concepts with more than three dimensions can also be studied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

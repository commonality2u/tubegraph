This article explores the [[difference_between_vectors_and_scalars | difference between vectors and scalars]], and how these concepts apply to motion, specifically distinguishing between speed and velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. While they might seem complex, these are actually very simple ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Vectors and Scalars Defined

A [[definition_of_vectors | vector]] is a quantity that possesses both a magnitude (or size) and a direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. In contrast, a scalar quantity only has a magnitude or size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Examples in Motion: Distance vs. Displacement

To illustrate the [[difference_between_vectors_and_scalars | difference between vectors and scalars]], consider the movement of a brick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

*   **Distance (Scalar)**: If a brick is moved 5 meters, and you are only told "5 meters," this quantity is a scalar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. You know the magnitude (5 meters) but not the direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. This is known as distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   **Displacement (Vector)**: If the brick is moved "5 meters to the right," this is a [[definition_of_vectors | vector]] quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. It includes both the magnitude (5 meters) and the direction (to the right) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. This quantity is called displacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

In summary, distance is a scalar quantity, while displacement is a [[definition_of_vectors | vector]] quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

## Speed vs. Velocity

Building on the concepts of distance and displacement, we can differentiate between speed and velocity. Imagine the brick was moved 5 meters to the right in 2 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

*   **Speed (Scalar)**: If you calculate how fast the brick moved by dividing the distance (5 meters) by the time (2 seconds), you get 2.5 meters per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. This value tells you "how fast it went" but does not include direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Therefore, 2.5 meters per second is a scalar quantity, and it represents the **speed** of the brick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   **Velocity (Vector)**: If you specify the movement as "2.5 meters per second to the right," you are providing both the magnitude (2.5 meters per second) and the direction (to the right) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. This makes it a [[definition_of_vectors | vector]] quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. When both speed and direction are specified, you are talking about **velocity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

To summarize the [[examples_of_vectors_and_scalars_in_motion | examples of vectors and scalars in motion]]:
*   If you specify the direction of a change in position, it's [[definition_of_vectors | displacement]]; if not, it's distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
*   If you give the direction of how fast something is going, it's velocity; if not, it's speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

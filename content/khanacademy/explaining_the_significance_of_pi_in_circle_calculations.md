The circle is considered the most [[fundamental_properties_of_circles | fundamental shape]] in our universe, appearing in everything from planetary orbits and wheels to molecular structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Understanding its properties is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Basic Properties of a Circle

A circle is defined as all points that are equidistant from a central point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

### The Radius
The consistent distance from the center to any point on the circle's edge is known as the [[definition_and_role_of_radius_in_circles | radius]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. For a given circle, the [[definition_and_role_of_radius_in_circles | radius]] never changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### The Diameter
The [[understanding_the_diameter_and_its_relation_to_the_radius | diameter]] is the distance across the circle at its widest point, always passing through the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This distance is equivalent to two radii combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Therefore, the [[understanding_the_diameter_and_its_relation_to_the_radius | diameter]] (*d*) is twice the [[definition_and_role_of_radius_in_circles | radius]] (*r*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>:

$d = 2r$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>

## Understanding Circumference

The circumference of a circle is the total distance around its edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Early mathematicians discovered a remarkable relationship between the circumference and the [[understanding_the_diameter_and_its_relation_to_the_radius | diameter]] of any circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## The Discovery of Pi ($\pi$)

Thousands of years ago, people began measuring circles and observing the ratio of their circumference to their [[understanding_the_diameter_and_its_relation_to_the_radius | diameter]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

Initially, with imprecise tools, this ratio often appeared to be roughly 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. However, as measurement techniques improved, it became clear that the ratio was closer to 3.1, then 3.14, and so on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

The mathematicians found that this ratio consistently yielded a non-repeating, non-terminating decimal: 3.14159... <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Because this number is so fundamental and appears for every circle, it was given a special name: **Pi**, symbolized by the Greek letter $\pi$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

> [!NOTE] The Nature of Pi
> Pi ($\pi$) is a mathematical constant that represents the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. It is an irrational number, meaning its decimal representation never ends and never repeats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. While it first appears in [[calculating_circumference_and_its_relationship_with_diameter | circle calculations]], Pi is a fundamental constant that appears across many areas of mathematics and physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

## Formulas for Circumference

Based on the definition of Pi, the relationship can be expressed as:
$ \frac{\text{Circumference}}{\text{Diameter}} = \pi $ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>

From this, the primary formula for circumference (*C*) can be derived by multiplying both sides of the [[understanding_mathematical_equations | equation]] by the diameter (*d*):
$ C = \pi d $ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>

Since the [[understanding_the_diameter_and_its_relation_to_the_radius | diameter]] is twice the [[definition_and_role_of_radius_in_circles | radius]] ($d = 2r$), the circumference can also be expressed in terms of the [[definition_and_role_of_radius_in_circles | radius]]:
$ C = \pi (2r) $ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>

This is most commonly written as:
$ C = 2\pi r $ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>

## Applications in Circle Calculations

### Example 1: Finding Circumference and Diameter from Radius
If a circle has a [[definition_and_role_of_radius_in_circles | radius]] of 3 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>:
*   **Circumference:**
    $ C = 2\pi r $ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>
    $ C = 2 \times \pi \times 3 \text{ meters} $ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>
    $ C = 6\pi \text{ meters} $ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>
    (This is often left in terms of $\pi$ for simplicity, as $\pi$ is an ongoing decimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.)
*   **Diameter:**
    $ d = 2r $ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>
    $ d = 2 \times 3 \text{ meters} $ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>
    $ d = 6 \text{ meters} $ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>

### Example 2: Finding Diameter and Radius from Circumference
If a circle has a circumference of 10 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>:
*   **Diameter:**
    We use the formula $ C = \pi d $ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
    $ 10 \text{ meters} = \pi d $ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>
    To solve for $d$, divide both sides by $\pi$:
    $ d = \frac{10}{\pi} \text{ meters} $ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>
    (This value is a number, approximately 3.18 meters, but often left in terms of $\pi$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.)
*   **Radius:**
    The [[definition_and_role_of_radius_in_circles | radius]] is half of the [[understanding_the_diameter_and_its_relation_to_the_radius | diameter]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
    $ r = \frac{1}{2} d $ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>
    $ r = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{10}{\pi} \text{ meters} $ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>
    $ r = \frac{5}{\pi} \text{ meters} $ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>

Understanding Pi as a constant number, approximately 3.14159, is key to comprehending [[calculating_circumference_and_its_relationship_with_diameter | circle calculations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

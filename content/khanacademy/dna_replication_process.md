[[DNA's structure | DNA's structure]], as a [[dna_structure_and_its_role_in_heredity | double helix]] or twisted ladder, is suitable for being the molecular basis of heredity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A key mechanism that makes DNA suitable for heredity is its ability to replicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Purpose of DNA Replication

For DNA to be the molecular basis of heredity, it needs to be replicable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. As a [[cell_division_in_human_biology | cell divides]], the two new cells need to have the same genetic material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The process by which [[DNA | DNA]] replicates is called replication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This occurs before a [[cell_division_in_human_biology | cell divides]] and duplicates itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

## Conceptual Mechanism of Replication

The conceptual idea of [[DNA | DNA]] replication involves splitting the two sides of the DNA ladder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Once split, either side of the original ladder can be used as a template to construct the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. This process results in two identical strands of [[DNA | DNA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### Base Pairing During Replication

During replication, the construction of the new strand follows specific base pairing rules:
*   Adenine (A) always pairs with Thymine (T) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   Thymine (T) pairs with Adenine (A) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   Guanine (G) pairs with Cytosine (C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   Cytosine (C) pairs with Guanine (G) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

By using one half of the original [[DNA | DNA]] ladder, a new complementary half is constructed, effectively replicating the entire [[DNA | DNA]] molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

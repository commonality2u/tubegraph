[[introduction_to_probability | Probability]] is a measurement of the likelihood that a particular event will occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. It is often denoted by 'p' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Key Concepts

*   **[[experimentation_in_probability | Trial]]**: An action or process that results in one of several possible [[events_and_outcomes_in_probability | outcomes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. For example, picking a marble out of a bag is considered a trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **[[events_and_outcomes_in_probability | Event]]**: The specific outcome or set of outcomes that one is interested in measuring the probability for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. An example of an event is picking a yellow marble from a bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.
*   **[[events_and_outcomes_in_probability | Outcomes]]**: The different possible results of a trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **[[sample_space_in_probability | Sample Space]]**: The set of all possible [[events_and_outcomes_in_probability | outcomes]] for a given trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Calculating Probability

To calculate the [[probability_calculation | probability]] of an event, the following formula is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>:

$P(\text{Event}) = \frac{\text{Number of outcomes that satisfy the event}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>

### Example: Picking a Yellow Marble

Consider a bag containing:
*   3 yellow marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>
*   2 red marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   2 green marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>
*   1 blue marble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>

To find the probability of picking a yellow marble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>:

1.  **Identify the total number of possible outcomes (the [[sample_space_in_probability | sample space]])**:
    *   3 yellow + 2 red + 2 green + 1 blue = 8 total marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
    *   There are 8 possible outcomes when picking a marble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

2.  **Identify the number of outcomes that satisfy the event (picking a yellow marble)**:
    *   There are 3 yellow marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
    *   Therefore, there are 3 outcomes that satisfy the event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

3.  **Calculate the probability**:
    *   $P(\text{Yellow Marble}) = \frac{\text{Number of yellow marbles}}{\text{Total number of marbles}} = \frac{3}{8}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>

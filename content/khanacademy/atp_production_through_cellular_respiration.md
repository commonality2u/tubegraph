[[overview_of_cellular_respiration | Cellular respiration]] is the process by which cells break down glucose and other fuel sources to generate [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]], the primary energy currency of the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This complex process involves several [[stages_of_cellular_respiration | stages]], each occurring in specific cellular locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Glycolysis

[[glycolysis_and_its_role_in_cellular_respiration | Glycolysis]] is the initial stage of [[overview_of_cellular_respiration | cellular respiration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
*   **Process**: A 6-carbon glucose molecule is split in half, resulting in two 3-carbon pyruvic acid (or pyruvate) molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The term "glycolysis" literally means "splitting glucose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
*   **Location**: [[glycolysis_and_its_role_in_cellular_respiration | Glycolysis]] occurs in the cytoplasm, the fluidic space of the cell located between organelles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Oxygen Requirement**: This stage can occur in the presence or absence of oxygen; it does not require oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This makes it an [[anaerobic_vs_aerobic_processes_in_cellular_respiration | anaerobic process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Products (per glucose molecule)**:
    *   **Net 2 [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATP]]s**: While two [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATP]]s are used in the [[atp_investment_and_payoff_phases_in_glycolysis | ATP investment stage]], four are generated, leading to a net gain of two [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATP]]s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
    *   **2 NADHs**: Two molecules of NADH are also produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Mitochondria: The Cell's Power Centers

Mitochondria are organelles within eukaryotic cells often called the "power centers of the cell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. They have an outer membrane and a convoluted inner membrane, which forms structures called cristae (plural) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. The space inside the inner membrane is known as the mitochondrial matrix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Subsequent stages of [[overview_of_cellular_respiration | cellular respiration]] take place within these structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## Pyruvate Oxidation (Preparatory Step)

Before entering the [[krebs_cycle_as_a_key_metabolic_pathway | Krebs cycle]], pyruvate undergoes an oxidation step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   **Process**: One carbon atom is cleaved off each 3-carbon pyruvate molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. This carbon leaves as CO2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. The remaining 2-carbon compound is called acetyl-CoA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   **Location**: This step occurs in the mitochondrial matrix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **Products (per pyruvate molecule)**:
    *   **1 NADH**: NAD+ is reduced to NADH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
    *   **1 CO2**: Carbon dioxide is released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **Per Glucose Molecule**: Since two pyruvates are produced from one glucose, this step occurs twice, yielding **2 NADHs** and **2 CO2s** per glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

## The [[krebs_cycle_as_a_key_metabolic_pathway | Krebs Cycle]] (Citric Acid Cycle)

The [[krebs_cycle_as_a_key_metabolic_pathway | Krebs cycle]], also known as the citric acid cycle, is a central metabolic pathway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Process**: Acetyl-CoA (2-carbon) merges with oxaloacetic acid (4-carbon) to form citrate (or citric acid), a 6-carbon molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. The citrate is then oxidized over a series of enzyme-catalyzed steps, eventually regenerating oxaloacetic acid to continue the cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. During this oxidation, two carbon atoms are cleaved off, released as CO2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   **Location**: The [[krebs_cycle_as_a_key_metabolic_pathway | Krebs cycle]] takes place in the matrix of the mitochondria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **Products (per turn of the cycle/per acetyl-CoA)**:
    *   **3 NADHs**: NAD+ is reduced to NADH in three separate steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
    *   **1 [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]]**: One molecule of [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]] is directly produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
    *   **1 FADH2**: FAD is reduced to FADH2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
    *   **2 CO2s**: Two molecules of carbon dioxide are released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   **Per Glucose Molecule**: Since two acetyl-CoA molecules enter the [[krebs_cycle_as_a_key_metabolic_pathway | Krebs cycle]] per glucose, the cycle turns twice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. Therefore, per glucose:
    *   **6 NADHs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>
    *   **2 [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]]s** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>
    *   **2 FADH2s** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>
    *   **4 CO2s** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>

## Total ATP Production from Cellular Respiration (Theoretical Maximum)

Accounting for all [[stages of cellular respiration | stages]] for one molecule of glucose:

### Direct ATP Production
*   From [[glycolysis_and_its_role_in_cellular_respiration | Glycolysis]]: 2 net [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]]s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>
*   From [[krebs_cycle_as_a_key_metabolic_pathway | Krebs Cycle]]: 2 [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]]s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>
*   **Total Direct ATP**: 4 [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]]s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>

### NADH and FADH2 Production
These molecules are crucial for indirect [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]] production in the electron transport chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   From [[glycolysis_and_its_role_in_cellular_respiration | Glycolysis]]: 2 NADHs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>
*   From Pyruvate Oxidation (per glucose): 2 NADHs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>
*   From [[krebs_cycle_as_a_key_metabolic_pathway | Krebs Cycle]] (per glucose): 6 NADHs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>
*   **Total NADHs**: 10 NADHs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>
*   From [[krebs_cycle_as_a_key_metabolic_pathway | Krebs Cycle]] (per glucose): 2 FADH2s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>
*   **Total FADH2s**: 2 FADH2s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>

### Indirect ATP Production from Electron Transport Chain
*   Each NADH produces approximately 3 [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]]s in the electron transport chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. Thus, 10 NADHs yield 30 [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]]s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
*   Each FADH2 produces approximately 2 [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]]s in the electron transport chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. Thus, 2 FADH2s yield 4 [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]]s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.
*   **Total Indirect ATP**: 34 [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]]s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>

### Overall Theoretical ATP Yield
Summing direct and indirect [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]]:
*   4 (direct) + 34 (indirect) = **38 [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]]s** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.
This 38 [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]] total represents the theoretical maximum in a super-efficient cell and is a commonly cited number in introductory biology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

## Catabolism of Other Macromolecules

While glucose is the primary focus of [[overview_of_cellular_respiration | carbohydrate metabolism]], cells can also catabolize (break down) other macromolecules like proteins and fats to produce [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.
*   **Proteins**: Can be broken down into amino acids, which can then be converted into acetyl-CoA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.
*   **Fats**: Can be turned into glucose (in the liver) or directly into acetyl-CoA through beta-oxidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.
*   **Acetyl-CoA as an Intermediary**: Acetyl-CoA serves as a general catabolic intermediary, allowing proteins, fats, and carbohydrates to all enter the [[krebs_cycle_as_a_key_metabolic_pathway | Krebs cycle]] and contribute to [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]] generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

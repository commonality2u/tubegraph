When [[converting_fractions_to_decimals | converting fractions to decimals]], some fractions result in decimals where a sequence of digits repeats indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This type of decimal is known as a recurring or repeating decimal.

## How Recurring Decimals Arise

The process of [[converting_fractions_to_decimals | converting a fraction to a decimal]] involves dividing the numerator by the denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. If, during this [[using_long_division_with_multidigit_numbers | long division]] process, a remainder reappears, the decimal digits will begin to repeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### Example: 1/3

To convert the fraction 1/3 to a decimal, divide 1 by 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>:
```
    0.333...
  _______
3 | 1.000
    - 9
    ---
      10
    -  9
    ----
       10
    -   9
    -----
        1
```
In this example, the remainder 1 continuously reappears, causing the digit '3' to repeat indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. So, 1/3 is equal to 0.33333... <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Notation for Recurring Decimals

Since it's impossible to write an infinite number of repeating digits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, a special notation is used:

*   A line placed on top of the repeating digit or pattern of digits indicates that the number pattern repeats indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

For example, 1/3 can be written as:
*   0.33 repeating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a> (with a line over both 3s, though commonly over the first 3)
*   0.3 repeating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a> (with a line over the single 3)

### Example with an Improper Fraction: 17/9

Recurring decimals can also result from [[improper_fractions_as_decimals | improper fractions]], where the numerator is larger than the denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This will yield a decimal greater than 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

To convert 17/9 to a decimal, divide 17 by 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>:
```
    1.888...
  _______
9 | 17.000
    - 9
    ---
      8 0
    - 7 2
    -----
        80
    -   72
    ------
         8
```
Here, the remainder 8 keeps recurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, causing the digit '8' to repeat after the decimal point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. So, 17/9 is equal to 1.88 where the '.88' actually repeats forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. This can be written as 1.8 repeating (with a line over the 8).

> [!TIP]
> The method of dividing the denominator into the numerator will always work for [[converting_fractions_to_decimals | converting fractions to decimals]], whether the result is a terminating decimal or a recurring decimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. You may need to add trailing zeros after the decimal point of the numerator to continue the division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

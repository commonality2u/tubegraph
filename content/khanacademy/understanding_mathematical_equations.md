Mathematics, particularly algebra, serves as a fundamental language for understanding the universe itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. As famously stated by Galileo Galilei:

> "Philosophy is written in that great book which ever lies before our eyes-- I mean the universe-- but we cannot understand it if we do not first learn the language and grasp the symbols in which is written. This book is written in the [[mathematical_expressions | mathematical language]], without which one wanders in vain through a dark labyrinth." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>

This perspective highlights that mathematical concepts, at their core, are pure and fundamental ideas that explain how the universe is structured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. These concepts can be applied across various fields such as economics, finance, physics, and chemistry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## From Concrete to Abstract: The Essence of Algebra

[[understanding_algebraic_expressions | Algebra]] allows for the abstraction and generalization of ideas, revealing underlying connections across different domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Calculating a Discount: A Step-by-Step Abstraction

Let's begin with a simple, concrete example: calculating a discount on an item at a store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

#### Specific Case: $20 Pants with 30% Off
If a pair of pants costs $20 and is on a 30% off sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, the discount is calculated by multiplying the percentage by the price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>:
*   Discount = 30% × $20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>
*   Discount = 0.30 × $20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>
*   Discount = $6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>

#### Generalizing for Any Product
To generalize this for any product in the store, we can introduce a symbol, 'x', to represent the non-discount price of the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   Discount = 30% × x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>
*   Discount = 0.30 × x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>

With this [[understanding_algebraic_expressions | algebraic expression]], we can now calculate the discount for any product by substituting its price for 'x' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. For example, a $10 product would have a $3 discount (0.30 × 10 = 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

#### Generalizing for Any Sale Percentage and Any Product
We can abstract this even further by defining 'p' as the percentage off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. If we also let 'y' represent the discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>, the relationship becomes an [[understanding_linear_equations | equation]]:
*   y = p × x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>

This [[understanding_linear_equations | equation]] is now a general way to calculate a discount for any given percentage off ('p') and any product price ('x') <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. The specific letters used (y, p, x) are arbitrary; any symbols could be used as long as their meaning is consistently tracked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

## Universal Applications of Abstract Equations

The power of an [[understanding_linear_equations | equation]] like `y = p × x` is that it represents a core idea that applies to situations completely unrelated to discounts or pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

For instance, in physics, the equation for force is:
*   Force = Mass × Acceleration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>

Though the letters are different, this is fundamentally the same mathematical idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. We could map them as:
*   y = Force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>
*   p = Mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>
*   x = Acceleration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>

Thus, `Force = Mass × Acceleration` is the exact same [[understanding_linear_equations | equation]] as `y = p × x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. This single abstract [[understanding_linear_equations | equation]] has an infinite number of applications across diverse fields like economics, finance, computer science, logic, electrical engineering, and accounting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

## Manipulating Abstract Equations

The beauty of [[understanding_algebraic_expressions | algebra]] lies in its ability to focus on and manipulate these abstract forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Discoveries made through these manipulations can then be reapplied to all specific contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

Consider the equation `y = p × x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. If we divide both sides of the [[understanding_linear_equations | equation]] by 'x' to maintain equality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>:
*   y / x = (p × x) / x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>

Since multiplying by 'x' and then dividing by 'x' results in the original value, the 'x' terms on the right side cancel out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>, leaving us with:
*   y / x = p <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>

This manipulation of the abstract [[understanding_linear_equations | equation]] reveals a fundamental truth about their relationship, applicable to every scenario where `y = p × x` holds true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. For example, in the discount scenario, `(discount) / (original price) = (percentage off)`. In physics, `Force / Acceleration = Mass`.

Mathematics, particularly [[understanding_algebraic_expressions | algebra]], provides a language to understand the true structure of the universe, stripping away human-defined applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. This universality is why mathematics is often considered the first common ground for communication with potential alien life forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

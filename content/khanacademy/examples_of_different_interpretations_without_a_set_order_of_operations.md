Without an [[agreed_upon_order_of_operations|agreed upon order of operations]], mathematical statements can be interpreted in multiple ways, leading to different results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This ambiguity is problematic in mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. For instance, if mathematical instructions for a satellite were interpreted differently by two computers, the satellite could go to an unintended destination like Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This highlights the critical need for a universal standard to [[introduction_to_order_of_operations|interpret mathematical statements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## Ambiguous Calculation Example

Consider the mathematical statement `7 + 3 * 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Without a predefined [[agreed_upon_order_of_operations|order of operations]], two common interpretations arise:

### Interpretation 1: Left-to-Right Execution

One natural way to interpret the statement is to read it from left to right, performing operations as they appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, doing addition first then multiplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>:

*   First, `7 + 3` equals `10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   Then, `10 * 5` equals `50` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

This interpretation yields a result of `50` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

### Interpretation 2: Prioritizing Multiplication

Another interpretation could prioritize multiplication before addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>:

*   First, `3 * 5` equals `15` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   Then, `7 + 15` equals `22` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

This interpretation yields a result of `22` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

As demonstrated, the same mathematical statement produces two different answers (`50` vs. `22`) depending on the interpretation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. This inconsistency is "completely unacceptable" in mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. The need for an [[agreed_upon_order_of_operations|agreed upon order of operations]] is paramount to ensure a single, consistent interpretation for all mathematical expressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

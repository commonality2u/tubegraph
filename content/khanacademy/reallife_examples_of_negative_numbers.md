## Real-Life Examples of Negative Numbers

[[introduction_to_negative_numbers | Negative numbers]], though initially appearing mysterious, are frequently encountered in everyday life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Fundamentally, a [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negative number]] is any number less than 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Understanding them often comes from contextualizing them in practical scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

### Temperature

Temperature is a common context where [[visualizing_negative_numbers_through_temperatures_and_bank_accounts | negative numbers]] are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
Consider a temperature scale, for instance, in Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>:
*   0 degrees Celsius is a reference point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   Numbers like 1, 2, or 3 degrees Celsius are above 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

If the temperature is 3 degrees Celsius and it drops by 4 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>:
*   A drop of 1 degree would make it 2 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   A drop of 2 degrees would make it 1 degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   A drop of 3 degrees would make it 0 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   To drop 4 degrees, you must go one more degree below 0, which is represented as -1 (negative 1) degree Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

On a [[understanding_negative_numbers_on_a_number_line | number line]], temperatures increase in positive values as you move to the right of 0, and decrease into [[understanding_negative_numbers_on_a_number_line | negative numbers]] as you move to the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This means that -3 degrees is colder and represents less heat than -1 degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Similarly, -100 degrees is much smaller than -1 degree, indicating a significantly greater lack of heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Bank Accounts

Another practical example of [[visualizing_negative_numbers_through_temperatures_and_bank_accounts | negative numbers]] is in managing bank accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
Consider starting with $10 in a bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. If you then spend $30, and the bank allows you to spend more money than you have (overdraft) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>:
*   You start with $10.
*   Spending $30 means you subtract $30 from your balance: $10 - $30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   This results in a balance of -$20 (negative $20) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

A negative balance of -$20 indicates that you owe the bank $20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. It means you not only have nothing, but you are in debt to the bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
On a [[understanding_negative_numbers_on_a_number_line | number line]], starting at $10 and spending $30 means moving 30 spaces to the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. Moving 10 spaces left brings you to $0, and moving another 20 spaces left brings you to -$20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

### Generalizing from Examples

These examples illustrate the core concept:
*   When moving to the left on a [[understanding_negative_numbers_on_a_number_line | number line]], numbers get smaller, extending into [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negative numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. This represents concepts like getting colder, losing money, or subtracting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   When moving to the right on a [[understanding_negative_numbers_on_a_number_line | number line]], numbers get larger, representing concepts like getting warmer, gaining money, or adding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

For instance, 3 minus 4 is like starting at 3 on the [[understanding_negative_numbers_on_a_number_line | number line]] and moving 4 units to the left, which lands on -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Similarly, 2 minus 8 starts at 2 and moves 8 units left, ending at -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. Even when starting with a [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negative number]], like -4 minus 2, you move further left from -4 by 2 units, resulting in -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Conversely, adding to a [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negative number]], such as -3 plus 2, means moving to the right, leading to -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

Visualizing these operations on a [[understanding_negative_numbers_on_a_number_line | number line]] helps to build an intuitive understanding of [[negative_number_arithmetic | adding and subtracting negative numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

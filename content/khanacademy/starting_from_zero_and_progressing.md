No one is born with inherent knowledge or abilities; everyone begins at a baseline of zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This initial state includes fundamental inabilities such as talking, walking, or performing complex tasks like algebra, [[adding_negative_numbers | adding]], reading, or riding a bike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

### The Universal Starting Point

Initially, no one is proficient at anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. For instance:
*   Albert Einstein, renowned for his intellect, once could not count to ten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   William Shakespeare, the celebrated playwright, had to learn his ABCs like everyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

### The [[the_process_of_learning_and_growth | Learning]] [[the_process_of_learning_and_growth | Process]]

Humans are naturally inclined to [[the_process_of_learning_and_growth | learn]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The [[the_process_of_learning_and_growth | process of learning]] is characterized by:
*   **Initial Struggle**: It involves stumbling, slipping, crawling, falling, and failing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This phase can be frustrating and confusing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   **Gradual Progression**: [[the_process_of_learning_and_growth | Learning]] progresses incrementally, with one step building on the next, and each new idea stacking upon previous ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **Strengthening Through Errors**: Even incorrect answers contribute to mental development, making the brain stronger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Failure as Growth**: Failing is not a setback but an indicator of [[the_process_of_learning_and_growth | growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This continuous effort is what constitutes [[the_process_of_learning_and_growth | learning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Capacity for [[the_process_of_learning_and_growth | Learning]]

It is important to maintain confidence that understanding will eventually be achieved, even if not immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The most intricate and profound concepts in the universe are founded upon [[basic_addition_concepts | basic ideas]] that are universally accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Regardless of an individual's background or location, the fundamental principle remains: anyone can [[the_process_of_learning_and_growth | learn]] anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

Statistics involves getting your head around data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. It can be broadly classified into three categories:
*   **Descriptive Statistics**: Used when you have a lot of data and want to convey information about it without providing all the raw data. This involves finding indicative numbers that represent the whole dataset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Predictive Statistics**: (Mentioned, but not elaborated upon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>
*   **Inferential Statistics**: Uses sampled data to make conclusions or inferences about a larger population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

The focus here is on [[descriptive_statistics | descriptive statistics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## Understanding [[Central Tendency]]

When describing a set of numbers, a common goal is to find a single number that is most indicative of all the numbers in that set, representing its [[central_tendency | central tendency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This concept is often referred to as the "average" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. An average, in this context, gives a sense of the [[central_tendency | central tendency]] or is the most representative number of a set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

### [[Measures of Central Tendency]]

There are several ways to measure the [[central_tendency | central tendency]] or average of a set of numbers, including the [[Arithmetic mean | mean]], the [[Median | median]], and the mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. In everyday language, when people refer to "the average," they are usually talking about the [[arithmetic_mean | arithmetic mean]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

#### [[Arithmetic Mean]]

The [[arithmetic_mean | arithmetic mean]] (often just called the "mean") is calculated by adding up all the numbers in a set and dividing by the total count of numbers in that set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

**Example**: For the set {1, 1, 2, 3, 4} <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>:
(1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4) / 5 = 11 / 5 = 2.2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
The [[arithmetic_mean | arithmetic mean]] of this set is 2.2, which represents its [[central_tendency | central tendency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

#### [[Median]]

The [[median | median]] is found by arranging the numbers in order and then identifying the middle number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

**Example (Odd Number of Values)**: For the set {1, 1, 2, 3, 4} <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>:
The numbers are already in order. With five numbers, the middle number is the third one: 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. There are two numbers greater than 2 and two numbers less than 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
The [[median | median]] of this set is 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

**Example (Even Number of Values)**: For the set {1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4} <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>:
When there's an even number of values, there isn't a single middle number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. In this case, you take the two middle numbers and calculate their [[arithmetic_mean | arithmetic mean]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. For {1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4}, the middle two numbers are 2 and 3.
The [[median | median]] would be (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

#### Mode

The mode is the number that appears most frequently in a set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

**Example**: For the set {1, 1, 2, 3, 4} <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>:
The number 1 appears twice, while others appear once. So, the mode is 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

**Example (Multiple Modes)**: For the set {1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4} <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>:
Both 1 and 4 appear twice. In such cases, the set can be considered to have multiple modes (1 and 4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. However, most tests will present a set with a single most common number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

### Comparing [[Measures of Central Tendency]] with Outliers

Different [[measures_of_central_tendency | measures of central tendency]] can provide a more representative "average" depending on the data distribution, especially when dealing with outliers. An outlier is a number that "really sticks out" from the rest of the data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

**Example**: Consider the set {3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 100} <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

*   **[[Arithmetic Mean]]**: (3+3+3+3+3+100) / 6 = 115 / 6 = 19 and 1/6 (approx. 19.17) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
    *   This value (19.17) doesn't seem highly indicative of a set dominated by 3s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. The 100 acts as an outlier, skewing the [[arithmetic_mean | arithmetic mean]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

*   **[[Median]]**: The ordered set is {3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 100}. Since there are six numbers, the middle two are both 3s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
    *   The [[median | median]] is the [[arithmetic_mean | arithmetic mean]] of 3 and 3, which is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
    *   The [[median | median]] is less affected by the outlier, providing a better measurement of the [[central_tendency | central tendency]] in this case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

*   **Mode**: The most common number in the set {3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 100} is 3, as it appears five times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
    *   Like the [[median | median]], the mode also provides a value (3) that is more indicative of the majority of numbers in the set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

The choice of which measure to use depends on the data and the application. For instance, when discussing average home prices where one very expensive house could skew the [[arithmetic_mean | arithmetic mean]], the [[median | median]] house price might offer a more accurate perception of typical home values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

These [[measures_of_central_tendency | measures of central tendency]] are human constructs designed to help understand large datasets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. In the next video, the discussion will move from [[central_tendency | central tendency]] to how spread apart data points are from that [[central_tendency | central tendency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

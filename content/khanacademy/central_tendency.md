The [[central_tendency_and_averages | Central Tendency]] is a way to represent the "average" of a data set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. It provides a single value that attempts to describe the center of the data.

## Arithmetic Mean (Average)

The most common measure of [[mean_and_central_tendency | central tendency]] is the arithmetic mean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

> [!INFO] Population vs. Sample Mean
> In statistics, it's important to distinguish between a population and a sample <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. If we assume we have the entire population of data, we calculate the population mean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. In situations where only a subset (sample) of the data is available, methods are used to estimate population characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. For now, we assume we're dealing with the entire population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### [[calculating_mean | Calculating Mean]]

To calculate the arithmetic mean, sum all the data points and divide by the total number of data points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

**Example Data Set 1:** -10, 0, 10, 20, 30

The [[calculating_mean | mean]] is calculated as:
(-10 + 0 + 10 + 20 + 30) / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>
= 50 / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>
= 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>

**Example Data Set 2:** 8, 9, 10, 11, 12

The [[calculating_mean | mean]] is calculated as:
(8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12) / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>
= 50 / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>
= 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>

Both data sets have the exact same arithmetic mean of 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

## Limitations of [[central_tendency_and_averages | Central Tendency]] Alone

While both example data sets share the same [[mean_median_and_mode | mean]], they are clearly different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
In the first set, numbers like -10 and 30 are further from the mean of 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
In the second set, numbers like 8, 9, 11, and 12 are very close to 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

This highlights that [[measures_of_central_tendency | measures of central tendency]] alone do not provide a complete picture of a data set. To understand how spread apart the data is, additional [[measures_of_central_tendency | measures]] of dispersion are required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

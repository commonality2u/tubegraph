[[overview_of_glycolysis | Glycolysis]] is the fundamental initial stage of [[overview_of_cellular_respiration | cellular respiration]], responsible for breaking down glucose.

## Overview and Process
[[overview_of_glycolysis | Glycolysis]] literally means "splitting of glucose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. It begins with a 6-carbon glucose molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, which is split in half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This process yields two 3-carbon molecules called pyruvic acid or pyruvate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Location
[[overview_of_glycolysis | Glycolysis]] takes place in the cytoplasm, the fluidic space within the cell between the organelles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## Oxygen Dependence
A key characteristic of [[overview_of_glycolysis | glycolysis]] is that it does not require oxygen to occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. It can happen in the presence or absence of oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Products of Glycolysis
For every molecule of glucose, [[overview_of_glycolysis | glycolysis]] produces:
*   **Two pyruvate molecules** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   **A net payoff of two [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATPs]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. This is a net amount because, during its [[glycolysis_phases_and_process | investment stage]], two [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATPs]] are used, but four are subsequently generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   **Two [[role_of_nad_and_nadh_in_glycolysis | NADHs]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

These products are crucial for the subsequent stages of [[overview_of_cellular_respiration | cellular respiration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## Role in Cellular Respiration and Energy Production
[[overview_of_glycolysis | Glycolysis]] is the first step in breaking down glucose for energy. Its direct [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATP]] yield is small, but its primary contribution to the overall [[impact_of_glycolysis_in_cellular_respiration | energy production of cellular respiration]] lies in producing pyruvate and [[role_of_nad_and_nadh_in_glycolysis | NADH]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

### Pyruvate and the Krebs Cycle
The two pyruvate molecules produced by [[overview_of_glycolysis | glycolysis]] then undergo pyruvate oxidation, a preparatory step for the Krebs cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. During pyruvate oxidation, each pyruvate molecule is converted into a 2-carbon compound called acetyl-CoA, releasing one carbon dioxide molecule and reducing one NAD+ to [[role_of_nad_and_nadh_in_glycolysis | NADH]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Since there are two pyruvates per glucose molecule, this preparatory stage yields two [[role_of_nad_and_nadh_in_glycolysis | NADHs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

The acetyl-CoA then enters the Krebs cycle, which occurs in the mitochondria's matrix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. For each acetyl-CoA molecule (meaning two turns per glucose), the Krebs cycle produces:
*   Three [[role_of_nad_and_nadh_in_glycolysis | NADHs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>
*   One [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]] (or GTP, which is later converted to [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>
*   One FADH2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>
*   Two carbon dioxide molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>

### NADH, FADH2, and the Electron Transport Chain
The [[role_of_nad_and_nadh_in_glycolysis | NADHs]] produced in [[overview_of_glycolysis | glycolysis]], pyruvate oxidation, and the Krebs cycle, along with the FADH2 from the Krebs cycle, are crucial inputs for the electron transport chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. This is where the vast majority of [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]] is generated <a class="yt=" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

From one glucose molecule, the entire process of [[overview_of_cellular_respiration | cellular respiration]] yields:
*   **Direct [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]] (net)**: 2 from [[overview_of_glycolysis | glycolysis]] + 2 from Krebs cycle = 4 [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATPs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.
*   **Total [[role_of_nad_and_nadh_in_glycolysis | NADHs]]**: 2 from [[overview_of_glycolysis | glycolysis]] + 2 from pyruvate oxidation + 6 from Krebs cycle = 10 [[role_of_nad_and_nadh_in_glycolysis | NADHs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
*   **Total FADH2s**: 2 from Krebs cycle = 2 FADH2s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

In the electron transport chain, each [[role_of_nad_and_nadh_in_glycolysis | NADH]] typically produces 3 [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATPs]], leading to 30 [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATPs]] from the 10 [[role_of_nad_and_nadh_in_glycolysis | NADHs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. Each FADH2 typically produces 2 [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATPs]], yielding 4 [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATPs]] from the 2 FADH2s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

Therefore, the theoretical maximum [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]] yield from one glucose molecule through [[overview_of_cellular_respiration | cellular respiration]] is 4 (direct) + 30 (from [[role_of_nad_and_nadh_in_glycolysis | NADH]]) + 4 (from FADH2) = 38 [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATPs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. This highlights the critical [[impact_of_glycolysis_in_cellular_respiration | role of glycolysis]] as the gateway to this extensive energy production pathway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

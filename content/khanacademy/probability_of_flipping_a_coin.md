[[introduction_to_probability | Probability]] provides a way to describe the chances of fundamentally random events occurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:17">[01:11:17]</a>. When considering a coin flip, it allows for quantifying the likelihood of specific results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:17">[01:11:17]</a>.

## The Fair Coin
A fair coin is defined as one that has an equal chance of landing on either side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Its sides are considered equal in weight, ensuring it is not more likely to land on one side over the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Typically, one side is designated "heads" (often depicted with a face like George Washington) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a> and the other side is "tails" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## [[Coin flipping and possible outcomes | Coin Flipping Experiment]]
[[Coin flipping and possible outcomes | Flipping a coin]] is considered an experiment in probability, which involves running a random event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. When a fair coin is flipped, there are two [[coin_flipping_and_possible_outcomes | equally likely possibilities]]: it can land on either heads or tails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. It is assumed the coin lands flat and not on its edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## [[Calculating probability | Calculating Probability]] of Getting Heads
To [[calculating_probability | calculate the probability]] of an event, such as getting heads, a common method involves two key factors:
1.  **Number of equally likely possibilities:** The total number of different outcomes that could occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
2.  **Number of possibilities that meet the condition:** The number of outcomes that satisfy the specific event of interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

The probability is expressed as a fraction:

$$
P(\text{Event}) = \frac{\text{Number of possibilities that meet my conditions}}{\text{Number of equally likely possibilities}}
$$

For [[calculating_probabilities_for_specific_outcomes | calculating the probability]] of getting heads:
*   There are two [[coin_flipping_and_possible_outcomes | equally likely possibilities]]: heads or tails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   Only one of these possibilities is "heads" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

Therefore, the probability of getting heads is 1/2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This can also be expressed as a percentage, which is 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

## Conceptualizing Probability Through Repetition
Another way to [[understanding_probability_concepts | understand probability]] is by considering what happens if the experiment is performed many, many times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. If a coin flip experiment were to be run thousands, millions, or even an infinite number of times, the probability represents the percentage of those trials that would result in the desired outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

For a fair coin, if flipped an infinite number of times, approximately 50% of those flips would result in heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. While there is always a very small chance of extreme results (like all tails over a million flips) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, the more times the experiment is conducted, the closer the observed results will trend towards the true 50% probability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

### Practical Simulation
One can simulate this by taking many coins (e.g., 100 or 200 quarters or pennies), placing them in a box, shaking the box to simultaneously "flip" them, and then counting the number of heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This demonstration will show that a larger number of trials yields results closer to 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

This article explores the process of factoring second-degree polynomials, often called quadratics or [[mathematical_expressions | quadratic expressions]], into the product of two binomials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A second-degree polynomial is characterized by a variable raised to the second power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Understanding Binomial Products

To understand how to factor a quadratic, it's helpful to first understand how two binomials multiply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Consider the product of two generic binomials: (x + a) multiplied by (x + b) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

Expanding this product:
x \* x = x² <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>
x \* b = bx <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>
a \* x = ax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>
a \* b = ab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>

Summing these terms gives:
x² + bx + ax + ab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>

By combining the terms with 'x', this simplifies to:
x² + (a + b)x + ab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>

This general form reveals a key pattern:
*   The coefficient of the 'x' term (first-degree coefficient) is the **sum** of 'a' and 'b' (a + b) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   The constant term is the **product** of 'a' and 'b' (ab) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

This pattern is fundamental for factoring quadratic expressions where the leading coefficient (the coefficient of the x² term) is 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

## Factoring Examples

The process involves finding two numbers (a and b) that satisfy both the sum and product conditions. It's often easiest to consider the factors of the constant term first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### Example 1: All Positive Terms

**Problem:** Factor x² + 10x + 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>
**Goal:** Find 'a' and 'b' such that:
*   a + b = 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>
*   a \* b = 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>

**Solution:**
Factors of 9 are (1, 9) and (3, 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   3 + 3 = 6 (not 10) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>
*   1 + 9 = 10 (matches) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>

Therefore, a = 1 and b = 9.
**Factored form:** (x + 1)(x + 9) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>

### Example 2: Larger Numbers

**Problem:** Factor x² + 15x + 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>
**Goal:** Find 'a' and 'b' such that:
*   a + b = 15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>
*   a \* b = 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>

**Solution:**
Factors of 50 include (1, 50), (2, 25), (5, 10) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   1 + 50 = 51 (not 15) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>
*   2 + 25 = 27 (not 15) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>
*   5 + 10 = 15 (matches) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>

Therefore, a = 5 and b = 10.
**Factored form:** (x + 5)(x + 10) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>

### Example 3: Negative Middle Term, Positive Constant

**Problem:** Factor x² - 11x + 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>
**Goal:** Find 'a' and 'b' such that:
*   a + b = -11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>
*   a \* b = 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>

**Solution:**
Since the product is positive (24) and the sum is negative (-11), both 'a' and 'b' must be negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
Factors of 24 include (1, 24), (2, 12), (3, 8), (4, 6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
Consider their negative counterparts:
*   (-1) + (-24) = -25
*   (-2) + (-12) = -14
*   (-3) + (-8) = -11 (matches) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>
*   (-4) + (-6) = -10

Therefore, a = -3 and b = -8.
**Factored form:** (x - 3)(x - 8) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>

### Example 4: Positive Middle Term, Negative Constant

**Problem:** Factor x² + 5x - 14 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>
**Goal:** Find 'a' and 'b' such that:
*   a + b = 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>
*   a \* b = -14 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>

**Solution:**
Since the product is negative (-14), one number must be positive and the other negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
Factors of 14 are (1, 14), (2, 7) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.
Consider combinations where one is negative:
*   (-1) + 14 = 13
*   1 + (-14) = -13
*   (-2) + 7 = 5 (matches) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>
*   2 + (-7) = -5

Therefore, a = -2 and b = 7.
**Factored form:** (x - 2)(x + 7) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>

### Example 5: Negative Middle Term, Negative Constant

**Problem:** Factor x² - x - 56 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>
**Goal:** Find 'a' and 'b' such that:
*   a + b = -1 (coefficient of -x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>
*   a \* b = -56 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>

**Solution:**
One number is positive, one is negative, and the sum is negative, meaning the larger absolute value is negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
Common factors of 56 are (1, 56), (2, 28), (4, 14), (7, 8) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
The pair (7, 8) is close in value, which is good for a sum near zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.
*   (-8) \* 7 = -56 (matches) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>
*   (-8) + 7 = -1 (matches) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>

Therefore, a = -8 and b = 7.
**Factored form:** (x - 8)(x + 7) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>

### Example 6: Factoring out a Negative Leading Coefficient

When the x² term has a negative coefficient, the first step is to factor out -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

**Problem:** Factor -x² - 5x + 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>
**Step 1: Factor out -1:**
-1 \* (x² + 5x - 24) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>

**Step 2: Factor the remaining quadratic (x² + 5x - 24):**
Goal: Find 'a' and 'b' such that:
*   a + b = 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>
*   a \* b = -24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>

**Solution:**
Since the product is negative, one number is positive, and one is negative.
Factors of 24 include (1, 24), (2, 12), (3, 8), (4, 6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.
The pair (3, 8) is a good candidate.
*   (-3) \* 8 = -24 (matches) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>
*   (-3) + 8 = 5 (matches) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>

Therefore, a = -3 and b = 8.
**Factored form:** -1 \* (x - 3)(x + 8) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>

### Example 7: Another Negative Leading Coefficient

**Problem:** Factor -x² + 18x - 72 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>
**Step 1: Factor out -1:**
-1 \* (x² - 18x + 72) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>

**Step 2: Factor the remaining quadratic (x² - 18x + 72):**
Goal: Find 'a' and 'b' such that:
*   a + b = -18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>
*   a \* b = 72 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>

**Solution:**
Since the product is positive (72) and the sum is negative (-18), both 'a' and 'b' must be negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.
Factors of 72 include (1, 72), (2, 36), (3, 24), (4, 18), (6, 12), (8, 9) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.
Consider pairs that sum to -18:
*   (-8) + (-9) = -17 (close, but no) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>
*   (-6) + (-12) = -18 (matches) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>

Therefore, a = -6 and b = -12.
**Factored form:** -1 \* (x - 6)(x - 12) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>

Factoring quadratics is a skill that improves with practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. It involves identifying factors of the constant term and determining which combination sums to the middle coefficient, paying close attention to positive and negative signs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.

Interval notation is a way to express the set of all real numbers between two endpoints. It is commonly used to represent the solution sets of inequalities, especially those involving absolute values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

## Basic Principles

When solving inequalities, the solution often represents a range of numbers on a number line. Interval notation provides a concise way to write this range.

### "Less Than" Absolute Value Inequalities

Consider the inequality `|x| < 12` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.
The absolute value of `x` signifies its distance from 0 on a number line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. Therefore, `|x| < 12` means "all numbers `x` that are less than 12 units away from 0" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.

This implies that `x` must be:
*   Greater than -12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>
*   Less than 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>

Combining these, the solution can be written as the compound inequality: `-12 < x < 12` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.
In interval notation, this is expressed as `(-12, 12)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. The use of parentheses `()` indicates that the endpoints (-12 and 12) are *not* included in the solution set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.

Another example is the inequality `|5x + 3| < 7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>.
This means the expression `5x + 3` must be less than 7 units away from 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>.
This translates to the compound inequality: `-7 < 5x + 3 < 7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>.
Solving this:
*   Subtract 3 from all parts: `-10 < 5x < 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>
*   Divide all parts by 5: `-2 < x < 4/5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>
In interval notation, the solution is `(-2, 4/5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>.

### "Greater Than" Absolute Value Inequalities

Consider the inequality `|7x| >= 21` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.
This means that the expression `7x` must be 21 units or *more* away from 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.
This implies two separate conditions:
*   `7x` is greater than or equal to positive 21 (`7x >= 21`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>
*   **OR** `7x` is less than or equal to negative 21 (`7x <= -21`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>

Solving these two separate inequalities:
*   `7x <= -21` becomes `x <= -3` (dividing by 7) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>
*   `7x >= 21` becomes `x >= 3` (dividing by 7) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>

The solution set is `x <= -3` or `x >= 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>.
Graphically, this represents two distinct rays on the number line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. In interval notation, this would be written as `(-∞, -3] U [3, ∞)`, where `U` denotes the union of the two sets, and square brackets `[]` indicate that the endpoints (-3 and 3) are included.

Another example is `|2x/7 + 9| > 5/7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>.
This translates to:
*   `2x/7 + 9 > 5/7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:00">[10:43:00]</a>
*   **OR** `2x/7 + 9 < -5/7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>

Solving the first inequality:
*   Multiply by 7: `2x + 63 > 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>
*   Subtract 63: `2x > -58` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>
*   Divide by 2: `x > -29` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:14:00">[12:14:00]</a>

Solving the second inequality:
*   Multiply by 7: `2x + 63 < -5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25:00">[11:25:00]</a>
*   Subtract 63: `2x < -68` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>
*   Divide by 2: `x < -34` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">[12:22:00]</a>

The solution set is `x > -29` or `x < -34` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49:00">[12:49:00]</a>. In interval notation, this would be `(-∞, -34) U (-29, ∞)`.

## General Rules for Absolute Value Inequalities

While memorization is discouraged in favor of understanding the concept of distance from zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:00">[09:59:00]</a>, general rules can be observed for [[mathematical_expressions | mathematical expressions]] involving absolute values and constants (`a > 0`):

### Case 1: Less Than
If `|f(x)| < a` (where `f(x)` represents any [[function_notation | function notation]] or expression inside the absolute value) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>:
This means `f(x)` is less than `a` units away from 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>.
The solution is `-a < f(x) < a` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>.
In interval notation, this is `(-a, a)`. (For `|f(x)| <= a`, it would be `[-a, a]`).

### Case 2: Greater Than
If `|f(x)| > a` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>:
This means `f(x)` is more than `a` units away from 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>.
The solution is `f(x) > a` **OR** `f(x) < -a` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>.
In interval notation, this is `(-∞, -a) U (a, ∞)`. (For `|f(x)| >= a`, it would be `(-∞, -a] U [a, ∞)`).

Adam Smith, a Scottish philosopher, is recognized as one of the most famous economists of all time, and is considered the first real economist in the modern sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. His seminal work, *The Wealth of Nations*, was published in 1776, coincidentally the same year as the American Declaration of Independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## The Invisible Hand

One of Smith's most famous excerpts from *The Wealth of Nations* introduces the concept of the [[invisible_hand_and_selfinterest | invisible hand]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. He posited that an economic actor, by pursuing their own [[invisible_hand_and_selfinterest | self-interest]], often promotes the public interest without intending to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

> "He intends only his own gain. And he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an [[invisible_hand_and_selfinterest | invisible hand]] to promote an end which was no part of his intention." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>

This idea suggests that when individuals act in their own [[invisible_hand_and_selfinterest | self-interest]], the aggregate outcome can frequently be beneficial for society, even if those individual actors did not intend for that broader societal benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Smith argued that by pursuing one's own interest, one might "promote that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Core of Capitalism

This concept is fundamental to capitalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. The United States, for example, is as deeply influenced by Smith's foundational ideas of capitalism as it is by the Declaration of Independence and Constitution that define its democratic framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

While Smith wouldn't assert that acting in [[invisible_hand_and_selfinterest | self-interest]] is *always* good, or that people should never consider the aggregate implications of their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, he argued that frequently, [[invisible_hand_and_selfinterest | self-interested]] actions can lead to:
*   Greater good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>
*   More innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>
*   Better investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>
*   Increased productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>
*   More wealth, creating "a larger pie for everyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>

## Microeconomics and Macroeconomics

Smith's statements blend both [[introduction_to_microeconomics_and_macroeconomics | micro-economic]] and [[introduction_to_microeconomics_and_macroeconomics | macro-economic]] perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. The idea of individual actors pursuing [[invisible_hand_and_selfinterest | self-interest]] falls under [[introduction_to_microeconomics_and_macroeconomics | microeconomics]], while the broader impact on the economy or nation as a whole relates to [[introduction_to_microeconomics_and_macroeconomics | macroeconomics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Modern economists divide their study into these two branches:
*   **[[introduction_to_microeconomics_and_macroeconomics | Microeconomics]]**: The study of individual economic actors such as firms, people, or households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. It examines how these actors make decisions and allocate scarce resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **[[introduction_to_microeconomics_and_macroeconomics | Macroeconomics]]**: The study of the economy in aggregate, focusing on what happens when millions of individual actors interact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. It often addresses policy-related questions, such as the effects of taxes or regulations on overall productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

## From Philosophy to Mathematics

While Smith's ideas were rooted in philosophical and logical reasoning about human behavior and decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, modern economics attempts to make these concepts rigorous and mathematical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. This involves simplifying complex human motivations, such as assuming rationality or a desire to maximize gain, to allow for mathematical modeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. This mathematical approach helps clarify thinking and prove things based on assumptions, but it's crucial to remember that it's based on simplifications that might not always hold true in complex real-world scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. The importance lies in understanding the core intuition behind the economic principles, even beyond the mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

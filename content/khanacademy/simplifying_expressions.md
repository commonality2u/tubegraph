[[understanding_algebraic_expressions | Simplifying expressions]] involves applying mathematical principles, such as the distributive property, to make complex [[mathematical_expressions | expressions]] easier to understand or work with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This process often involves ideas already familiar from basic arithmetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## The Distributive Property

The [[strategies_for_dealing_with_complex_arithmetic_expressions | distributive property]] is a fundamental concept used in simplifying [[mathematical_expressions | expressions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. It allows multiplication to be distributed over addition or subtraction.

### Example 1: `2(3x + 5)`

To simplify the [[understanding_algebraic_expressions | expression]] `2(3x + 5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>:
*   The [[mathematical_expressions | expression]] `2(3x + 5)` literally means two instances of `(3x + 5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   This can be written as `(3x + 5) + (3x + 5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   By rearranging, this becomes `2(3x) + 2(5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This is the [[strategies_for_dealing_with_complex_arithmetic_expressions | distributive property]] in action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   Multiplying `2` by `3x` results in `6x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   Multiplying `2` by `5` results in `10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   Therefore, `2(3x + 5)` simplifies to `6x + 10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Simplifying More Complex Expressions

The same principles apply to more involved [[mathematical_expressions | expressions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### Example 2: `7(3y - 5) - 2(10 + 4y)`

To simplify the [[understanding_algebraic_expressions | expression]] `7(3y - 5) - 2(10 + 4y)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>:

1.  **Distribute the `7` in the first part**:
    *   `7` times `3y` equals `21y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
    *   `7` times `-5` equals `-35` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
    *   So, `7(3y - 5)` simplifies to `21y - 35` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

2.  **Distribute the `-2` in the second part**:
    *   Consider the `-2` as a single term to distribute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
    *   `-2` times `10` equals `-20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
    *   `-2` times `4y` equals `-8y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
    *   So, `-2(10 + 4y)` simplifies to `-20 - 8y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

3.  **Combine the simplified parts**:
    *   The [[mathematical_expressions | expression]] now looks like `21y - 35 - 20 - 8y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

4.  **Combine like terms**:
    *   Group terms with `y`: `21y - 8y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
        *   `21y - 8y = 13y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
    *   Group constant terms: `-35 - 20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
        *   `-35 - 20 = -55` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

5.  **Final simplified expression**:
    *   The entire [[understanding_algebraic_expressions | expression]] simplifies to `13y - 55` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

By using the [[strategies_for_dealing_with_complex_arithmetic_expressions | distributive property]] and combining similar terms, complex [[mathematical_expressions | expressions]] can be reduced to their simplest forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

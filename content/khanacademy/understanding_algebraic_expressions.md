[[understanding_mathematical_equations | Understanding mathematical equations]] is crucial for solving algebraic problems systematically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. It's important to know how to manipulate equations and what they represent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## What is an Algebraic Expression?

An [[mathematical_expressions | algebraic expression]] involves numbers, variables, and mathematical operations. For example, `7x = 14` literally means "7 times x is equal to 14" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

### Shorthand Notation

In algebra, when a number is written next to a variable (e.g., `7x`), it indicates multiplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This is a shorthand notation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

The traditional multiplication sign (`x`) is generally avoided in algebra because `x` is the most common variable, leading to potential confusion (e.g., `xx` or `times times`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

While a dot (`⋅`) can represent multiplication (e.g., `7 ⋅ x = 14`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, the most common practice when multiplying by a variable is simply writing the number next to the variable (e.g., `7x`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

### Coefficients

The number multiplying a variable in an [[mathematical_expressions | algebraic expression]] is called a **coefficient** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. For example, in `7x`, `7` is the coefficient.

## [[visualizing_algebraic_operations | Visualizing Algebraic Operations]]

To better [[understanding_mathematical_equations | understand mathematical equations]], it can be helpful to [[visualizing_algebraic_operations | visualize algebraic operations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

*   **Multiplication:** An expression like `7x` means that `x` is added to itself 7 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This can be represented as `x + x + x + x + x + x + x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Equations:** If `7x = 14`, it means that seven of `x` combined are equivalent to 14 individual units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
*   **Division:** When solving an equation like `7x = 14` by dividing both sides by 7, you are literally dividing both sides into seven equal groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. If the total amounts on both sides are equal, then each of these corresponding smaller chunks must also be equivalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. This visual confirms that `x` in `7x = 14` must be equal to 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

## Solving Algebraic Equations

The goal of [[understanding_mathematical_equations | understanding mathematical equations]] is to develop a systematic approach to solve them, especially as they become more complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

### Basic Steps for Equations with Coefficients

For equations in the form of `(coefficient) × (variable) = (number)`, the standard [[using_algebraic_steps_to_solve_equations | algebraic step to solve equations]] is to divide both sides by the coefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

*   **Example: `7x = 14`**
    1.  Divide both sides by 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
    2.  `7x / 7 = 14 / 7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
    3.  This results in `x = 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

*   **Example: `3x = 15`**
    1.  Divide both sides by 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
    2.  `3x / 3 = 15 / 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
    3.  This gives `x = 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

### The Equality Principle

When [[simplifying_expressions | simplifying expressions]] or [[understanding_mathematical_equations | understanding mathematical equations]], remember the equality principle:
> If two sides of an equation are equal, any operation performed on one side must also be performed on the other side to maintain the equality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

Dividing both sides by a number is equivalent to multiplying both sides by its reciprocal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. For example, dividing by 3 is the same as multiplying by 1/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

### [[combining_like_terms_in_algebra | Combining Like Terms in Algebra]]

When [[simplifying_expressions | simplifying expressions]] with multiple terms involving the same variable, you can [[combining_like_terms_in_algebra | combine like terms]].

*   **Example: `2y + 4y = 18`**
    1.  Visualize `2y` as `y + y` and `4y` as `y + y + y + y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
    2.  Counting the total `y`'s on the left side, there are six `y`'s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
    3.  This simplifies the equation to `6y = 18` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. This is analogous to saying "2 apples plus 4 apples equals 6 apples" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
    4.  Now, divide both sides by 6: `6y / 6 = 18 / 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
    5.  The solution is `y = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

### Checking Your Answer

A useful aspect of [[understanding_mathematical_equations | understanding mathematical equations]] is that you can always check if your solution is correct by substituting the variable's value back into the original equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

*   For `2y + 4y = 18` with `y = 3`:
    *   Substitute `y = 3`: `2(3) + 4(3) = 18` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.
    *   `6 + 12 = 18` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.
    *   Since `18 = 18`, the solution is correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

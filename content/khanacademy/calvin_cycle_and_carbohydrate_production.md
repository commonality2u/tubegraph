[[Basic Concept of Photosynthesis | Photosynthesis]], a vital biological process, allows plants, bacteria, and algae to convert carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight into sugars or carbohydrates, releasing oxygen as a byproduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This process is crucial for life on Earth, providing the carbohydrates needed to fuel bodies and the oxygen necessary for respiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

The general equation for [[Basic Concept of Photosynthesis | photosynthesis]] shows carbon dioxide (nCO₂) and water (nH₂O), with photons, combining to produce carbohydrates (CH₂O)n and oxygen (nO₂) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. For instance, in the case of [[role_of_glucose_in_energy_production | glucose]], 'n' is 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

## Stages of Photosynthesis

[[Detailed Process of Photosynthesis | Photosynthesis]] is broadly divided into two main stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>:
*   [[LightDependent and LightIndependent Reactions | Light-dependent reactions]] (or light reactions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>
*   [[LightDependent and LightIndependent Reactions | Light-independent reactions]] (also known as dark reactions or the Calvin Cycle) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>

## The Calvin Cycle

The Calvin Cycle is the part of [[Detailed Process of Photosynthesis | photosynthesis]] responsible for producing carbohydrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. It is also known as the [[LightDependent and LightIndependent Reactions | dark reactions]] or [[LightDependent and LightIndependent Reactions | light-independent reactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. While it occurs in the light, it does not directly require photons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Instead, it relies on the byproducts generated during the [[LightDependent and LightIndependent Reactions | light-dependent reactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

### Inputs and Outputs of the Calvin Cycle
The Calvin Cycle takes in three main constituents:
*   **ATP**: Adenosine triphosphate, which is the cellular energy currency produced during the light reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   **NADPH**: Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, a reducing agent that provides electrons and hydrogen from the light reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Similar to NADH in [[cellular_respiration_process | cellular respiration]], NADPH loses its hydrogen and associated electron, helping produce energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   **Carbon Dioxide (CO₂)**: This is where the carbons come from to build the carbohydrate molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

The Calvin Cycle does not directly produce [[role_of_glucose_in_energy_production | glucose]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Instead, it produces a simpler building block called phosphoglyceraldehyde (PGAL) or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. This molecule is a three-carbon compound with a phosphate group attached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

### Carbohydrate Production from PGAL/G3P
PGAL/G3P is the foundational molecule from which other carbohydrates, including [[role_of_glucose_in_energy_production | glucose]], can be produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. For example, two PGAL molecules can combine to produce [[role_of_glucose_in_energy_production | glucose]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

Interestingly, this PGAL/G3P molecule is also the first product formed when [[role_of_glucose_in_energy_production | glucose]] is split during [[steps_and_reactions_in_glycolysis | glycolysis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. In [[Detailed Process of Photosynthesis | photosynthesis]], the process is reversed: PGAL/G3P molecules are built up to create [[role_of_glucose_in_energy_production | glucose]] for energy storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

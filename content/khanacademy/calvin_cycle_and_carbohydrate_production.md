The [[Lightdependent and Lightindependent Reactions | Calvin Cycle]] is one of the two main stages of [[Importance of Photosynthesis | photosynthesis]], often referred to as the "dark reactions" or, more accurately, the [[Lightdependent and Lightindependent Reactions | light-independent reactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>. While it can occur in the dark, it does not require photons to proceed and primarily happens when the sun is out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. This cycle relies on the byproducts of the [[Lightdependent and Lightindependent Reactions | light reactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>.

## Inputs and Outputs of the Calvin Cycle

The [[Lightdependent and Lightindependent Reactions | Calvin Cycle]] uses specific inputs to produce carbohydrates:
*   **[[Role of ATP and NADPH in Photosynthesis | ATP]] and [[Role of ATP and NADPH in Photosynthesis | NADPH]]**: These molecules are produced during the [[Lightdependent and Lightindependent Reactions | light-dependent reactions]] and serve as energy currency and reducing agents, respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:00">[10:43:00]</a>. [[Role of ATP and NADPH in Photosynthesis | NADPH]] is similar to [[ATP production through cellular respiration | NADH]] seen in [[ATP production through cellular respiration | cellular respiration]], acting as a reducing agent that can give away hydrogen and its associated electron, with the energy released used in the dark reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:18]</a>.
*   **Carbon Dioxide (CO2)**: This is a crucial constituent, providing the carbons necessary to produce new molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a>.

The primary output of the [[Lightdependent and Lightindependent Reactions | Calvin Cycle]] is a three-carbon molecule called phosphoglyceraldehyde (PGAL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>, also known as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a>.

## Carbohydrate Production

PGAL/G3P serves as a fundamental building block for other carbohydrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:00">[11:48:00]</a>. For instance, two molecules of PGAL can be combined to produce [[chemical_equation_of_glucose | glucose]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:52:00">[11:52:00]</a>. This process effectively converts carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight energy into sugars and oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.

### Reverse of Glycolysis

The production of PGAL/G3P in [[Importance of Photosynthesis | photosynthesis]] is notable because it is the reverse of what happens in [[overall_equation_and_net_energy_yield_of_glycolysis | glycolysis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09:00">[13:09:00]</a>. In [[overall_equation_and_net_energy_yield_of_glycolysis | glycolysis]], [[chemical_equation_of_glucose | glucose]] is split into two PGAL/G3P molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:16:00">[13:16:00]</a>. Here, in [[Importance of Photosynthesis | photosynthesis]], the process builds [[chemical_equation_of_glucose | glucose]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:23:00">[13:23:00]</a>.

> [!INFO] Overall Equation of Photosynthesis
> The general equation for [[Importance of Photosynthesis | photosynthesis]] can be written as:
> `nCO2 + nH2O + photons -> (CH2O)n + nO2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.
>
> In this equation, `(CH2O)n` represents a general carbohydrate, where 'n' can be a multiple (e.g., n=6 for [[chemical_equation_of_glucose | glucose]], which is C6H12O6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>.
>
> This overall process does not happen directly but through a series of steps, including the [[Lightdependent and Lightindependent Reactions | light-dependent]] and [[Lightdependent and Lightindependent Reactions | light-independent reactions]] (Calvin Cycle) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.

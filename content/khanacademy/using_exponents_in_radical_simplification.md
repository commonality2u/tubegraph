This article explores how [[Relationship between exponents and logarithms | exponent rules]] are fundamental to [[Simplifying radicals | simplifying radicals]].

## Understanding Radicals

A radical is a mathematical symbol that looks like this: `√` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. It is more commonly known as the [[Understanding radicals and square roots | square root symbol]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The goal of [[Simplifying expressions | simplifying a radical]] is to present it in its most reduced form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

For example, the square root of 36 is easily simplified to 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Connecting Radicals to Exponents

The concept of a square root is directly linked to exponents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. A square root is the same as raising a number to the 1/2 power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

For example, the square root of 72 can be written as 72<sup>1/2</sup> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Demonstrating the Concept

To [[Simplifying radicals | simplify a radical]], you can utilize [[Relationship between exponents and logarithms | exponent rules]].

Consider the square root of 72:
1.  **[[Factorization for radical simplification | Factor]] the number under the radical:** 72 can be factored into 36 multiplied by 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This can be written as √(36 × 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
2.  **Convert to exponent form:** The expression becomes (36 × 2)<sup>1/2</sup> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
3.  **Apply exponent rules:** When multiplying two numbers raised to a power, it is the same as raising each number to that power individually and then multiplying them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. So, (36 × 2)<sup>1/2</sup> is equivalent to 36<sup>1/2</sup> × 2<sup>1/2</sup> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
4.  **Convert back to radical form:** This translates back to the square root of 36 multiplied by the square root of 2 (√36 × √2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
5.  **[[Simplifying expressions | Simplify]]:** Since the square root of 36 is 6, the expression simplifies to 6√2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

This process demonstrates that [[Simplifying radicals | radical simplification]] is merely an extension of existing [[Relationship between exponents and logarithms | exponent rules]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, not a new concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### Practical Application

To [[Simplifying radicals | simplify a radical]], the key is to identify the largest [[Factorization for radical simplification | factor]] of the number under the radical that is a perfect square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

Common perfect squares include: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

**Example: [[Simplifying radicals | Simplifying]] √50**
1.  Identify the largest perfect square [[Factorization for radical simplification | factor]] of 50. This is 25, as 50 = 25 × 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
2.  Rewrite: √50 = √(25 × 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
3.  Separate the radicals: √25 × √2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
4.  [[Simplifying expressions | Simplify]]: 5√2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

If the number under the radical is a prime number (like 29), it cannot be further simplified because its only factors are 1 and itself, neither of which are perfect squares that would allow for further simplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

For larger numbers, you can [[Factorization for radical simplification | factor]] in steps, pulling out perfect squares incrementally until no more perfect square factors remain under the radical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. This process stops when the number under the radical cannot be reduced anymore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

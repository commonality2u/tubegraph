The [[cellular_membrane_structure | cellular membrane]] defines the cell as a small compartment, separating it from the outside world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. While many proteins produced by free [[protein_synthesis_and_ribosomes | ribosomes]] float in the cytosol, cells also produce proteins intended for membranes or for use outside the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. This is where the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi bodies play a crucial role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

## Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)

The endoplasmic reticulum is a complex system of membranes that forms a network of tunnels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. It is a "big flap of convoluted membrane" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

### Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum (Rough ER)

Parts of the endoplasmic reticulum have [[protein_synthesis_and_ribosomes | ribosomes]] attached to their surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. These areas are called the rough endoplasmic reticulum, or rough ER <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. When [[messenger_rna_and_transcription_process | mRNA]] leaves the nucleus, it can attach to these ribosomes for [[translation_and_protein_synthesis | translation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. As the protein is synthesized, it is pushed into the interior (lumen) of the endoplasmic reticulum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. The amino acid chain, which forms the protein, ends up inside the ER <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

### Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum (Smooth ER)

Areas of the endoplasmic reticulum without attached [[protein_synthesis_and_ribosomes | ribosomes]] are known as the smooth endoplasmic reticulum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. Proteins travel through the ER, moving from the rough to the smooth regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. The smooth ER also has other functions, such as producing hormones and fatty compounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

## Golgi Bodies

Proteins continue their journey from the endoplasmic reticulum to structures called Golgi bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. Golgi bodies are stacks of folded membranes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Once proteins arrive at the Golgi bodies, they are prepared for transport outside the cell or to the cell's own [[cellular_membrane_structure | membrane]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

## Vesicle Transport

Proteins within the Golgi bodies can "bud off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>, taking a small portion of the Golgi membrane with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. This membrane-bound package containing the protein is called a vesicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. Vesicles are general terms for small, membrane-bound structures, usually containing proteins, that float around the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>.

The vesicle's mini-membrane is useful because it allows the protein to travel to the outer [[cellular_membrane_structure | membrane]] of the cell or to other parts of the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. The vesicle can then merge with the cell's [[cellular_membrane_structure | membrane]] because they are made of similar material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>. This merging process allows the protein to exit the cell or embed itself within the outer [[cellular_membrane_structure | cellular membrane]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus (also known as Golgi bodies) are key organelles within eukaryotic cells, working together to synthesize, modify, and transport proteins and lipids, particularly those destined for secretion from the cell, insertion into membranes, or delivery to other organelles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

## Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)

The endoplasmic reticulum is described as a "big flap of convoluted membrane" or "a bunch of tunnels" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. It extends throughout the cell and can have [[structure_and_function_of_ribosomes | ribosomes]] attached to its surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32">[08:32]</a>.

### Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum (Rough ER)
The rough ER is the portion of the endoplasmic reticulum that has [[structure_and_function_of_ribosomes | ribosomes]] attached to its membrane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

*   **Protein Synthesis and Translocation**
    When [[structure_and_function_of_ribosomes | mRNA]] leaves the nucleus and attaches to a [[structure_and_function_of_ribosomes | ribosome]] on the rough ER, the [[structure_and_function_of_ribosomes | mRNA]] is translated into a protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. As the protein is produced, it is pushed into the internal space (lumen) of the endoplasmic reticulum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. This mechanism ensures that proteins destined for the [[cellular_membrane_and_its_significance | cell's membrane]], or for use outside the cell, are correctly localized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

### Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum (Smooth ER)
The smooth ER is the region of the endoplasmic reticulum that does not have [[structure_and_function_of_ribosomes | ribosomes]] attached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.
*   **Protein Transport and Other Functions**
    Proteins synthesized in the rough ER travel through the smooth ER <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. The smooth ER also has other functions, such as producing hormones and other fatty compounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

## Golgi Apparatus (Golgi Bodies)

The Golgi apparatus, named after Mr. Golgi, is depicted as a "big kind of stack, or you can kind of view it as a bunch of folded membranes together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. It is connected to the endoplasmic reticulum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

*   **Protein Modification and Packaging**
    After proteins travel from the ER, they reach the Golgi apparatus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. The Golgi bodies are involved in further processing and packaging these proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. Proteins ready for transport, either outside the cell or to the [[cellular_membrane_and_its_significance | cell's membrane]], bud off from the Golgi apparatus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

*   **Vesicle Formation**
    Proteins exiting the Golgi apparatus are enclosed within small, membrane-bound sacs called vesicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. This membrane surrounding the protein allows it to travel through the cell, eventually merging with the [[cellular_membrane_and_its_significance | outer membrane of the cell]] or other destinations, facilitating the protein's exit or embedding within the membrane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.

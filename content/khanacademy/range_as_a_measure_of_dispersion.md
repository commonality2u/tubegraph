[[measures_of_dispersion|Measures of dispersion]] are used to understand how spread apart data points are within a data set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. This contrasts with [[measures_of_central_tendency|measures of central tendency]], which represent the average or center of the data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. One of the simplest ways to measure dispersion is by calculating the range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.

## Definition and Calculation

The range is a straightforward [[measures_of_dispersion|measure of dispersion]] that determines the spread between the largest and smallest numbers in a data set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. To calculate the range, you subtract the smallest number from the largest number in the data set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.

### Examples

Consider two data sets, both having an [[mean_in_statistics|arithmetic mean]] of 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>:

1.  **Data Set 1:** -10, 0, 10, 20, 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>
    *   Largest number: 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>
    *   Smallest number: -10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>
    *   Range = 30 - (-10) = 40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. This indicates a difference of 40 between the largest and smallest values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.

2.  **Data Set 2:** 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>
    *   Largest number: 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>
    *   Smallest number: 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>
    *   Range = 12 - 8 = 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.

In these examples, although both data sets have the same [[mean_in_statistics|mean]], the range clearly highlights that Data Set 1 (range of 40) is much more dispersed than Data Set 2 (range of 4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.

## Utility and Limitations

The range can be a good initial [[measures_of_dispersion|measure of dispersion]] to illustrate that a data set with a larger range is more dispersed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>. However, it does not always provide a complete picture of the data's distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. Two data sets can have the exact same range but still have very different distributions based on how the numbers are clustered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. This limitation means it is not often used as the sole measure of dispersion in more advanced statistical analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.

When considering how to allocate resources, such as time, individuals or entities face [[tradeoffs_in_resource_allocation | tradeoffs in resource allocation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Understanding the concept of efficient versus inefficient resource use involves analyzing the maximum possible output from available resources and identifying scenarios where resources are underutilized.

## The Hunter-Gatherer Dilemma: An Introduction to Tradeoffs
Imagine a hunter-gatherer who must decide how much time to spend hunting rabbits and how much time to spend gathering berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. To simplify the analysis, it is assumed that only rabbits can be hunted and only berries can be gathered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

Several scenarios illustrate these [[tradeoffs_in_resource_allocation | tradeoffs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>:

*   **Scenario A:** Spending all available time hunting yields 5 rabbits and 0 berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Scenario B:** Allocating less time to hunting and more to gathering results in 4 rabbits and 100 berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **Scenario C:** With even less time on rabbits, the output is 3 rabbits and 180 berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   **Scenario D:** Reducing hunting time further yields 2 rabbits and 240 berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Scenario E:** Just 1 rabbit hunted provides time for 280 berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   **Scenario F:** Spending all time gathering results in 0 rabbits and 300 berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

Throughout these scenarios, the principle of *ceteris paribus* (meaning "all other things being equal") is applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This means factors like total time available, sleep, hunting/gathering techniques, and tools remain constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. The only variable changing is the allocation of time between hunting and gathering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Defining the [[production_possibilities_frontier | Production Possibilities Frontier]]
When these scenarios are plotted on a graph, with rabbits on one axis and berries on the other, the resulting curve illustrates the [[production_possibilities_frontier | production possibilities frontier]] (PPF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. This curve represents all the possible combinations of goods that can be produced given available resources and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

## Interpreting Resource Use
The PPF helps categorize different levels of resource utilization:

### Efficient Resource Use
*   **Points ON the frontier** represent efficient resource use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. These points signify that the maximum possible output is being achieved given the available resources and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. For example, Scenario A (5 rabbits, 0 berries) and Scenario F (0 rabbits, 300 berries) are both efficient points on the frontier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. Any point on the curve means resources are being used to their fullest potential, making the most of one's time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. This concept aligns with [[understanding_optimal_production | understanding optimal production]].

### Inefficient Resource Use
*   **Points INSIDE the frontier** (below or to the left of the curve) are possible but represent inefficient resource use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. For instance, getting 1 rabbit and 200 berries is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. However, this is not optimal because, with the same resources, more berries could be gathered (if focusing on rabbits) or more rabbits could be hunted (if focusing on berries) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Such points indicate that resources are not being used optimally, perhaps due to lack of focus or underutilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

### Impossible Scenarios
*   **Points OUTSIDE the frontier** are impossible given the current resources and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. For example, obtaining 5 rabbits and 200 berries simultaneously is not achievable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. If all time is spent on rabbits, no berries can be gathered, and vice-versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

The [[production_possibilities_frontier | Production Possibilities Frontier]] is a fundamental concept in economics that visually represents the maximum possible output combinations, distinguishing between what is efficient, inefficient, and impossible for a given set of resources.

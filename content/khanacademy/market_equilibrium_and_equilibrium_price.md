Market equilibrium is a state where the quantity of a product supplied by producers precisely matches the quantity demanded by consumers, leading to a stable price and quantity in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:53">[08:50:53]</a>.

## Graphing Market Dynamics

To understand market dynamics, economists use a graph with two axes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>:
*   The vertical axis represents the **price** of the product, typically price per unit (e.g., price per pound) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
*   The horizontal axis represents the **quantity** of the product, often expressed in thousands of units over a specific period (e.g., thousands of pounds per week) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

### Demand Curve

The demand curve illustrates the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity consumers are willing to buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   **High Price, Low Quantity Demanded** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>: If the price of apples is very high (e.g., $5 a pound), consumers will demand a low quantity (e.g., 500 pounds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   **Low Price, High Quantity Demanded** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>: Conversely, if the price is low (e.g., $1 a pound), consumers will demand a much higher quantity (e.g., 4,000 pounds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Definition of Demand vs. Quantity Demanded**: The term "demand" refers to the entire relationship between price and quantity, whereas "quantity demanded" refers to the specific quantity at a particular price point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### Supply Curve

The supply curve shows the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity producers are willing to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Low Price, Low Quantity Supplied**: Below a certain price (e.g., 50 cents), producers may not be willing to produce any apples at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. At slightly higher prices (e.g., $1), they might supply a low quantity (e.g., 1,000 pounds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **High Price, High Quantity Supplied**: As the price increases, producers are willing to supply more apples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This represents the collective behavior of all suppliers in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Moving Towards Equilibrium

Markets naturally adjust towards equilibrium through the forces of [[shortages_and_surpluses_in_markets | shortages]] and [[shortages_and_surpluses_in_markets | surpluses]].

### Scenario 1: Shortage

Imagine suppliers initially price apples at $1 per pound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **Quantity Supplied**: At this price, suppliers are willing to provide 1,000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   **Quantity Demanded**: However, consumers demand 4,000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   **Result**: This creates a [[shortages_and_surpluses_in_markets | shortage]] of 3,000 pounds of apples (4,000 demanded - 1,000 supplied) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   **Market Adjustment**: With a [[shortages_and_surpluses_in_markets | shortage]], consumers will bid up prices, and producers will respond by increasing the quantity supplied in the next period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. This moves the market up the supply curve and reduces the quantity demanded along the demand curve, moving closer to equilibrium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

### Scenario 2: Surplus

Now, imagine suppliers set the price high, at $3 per pound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **Quantity Supplied**: Producers are excited to supply 3,000 pounds at this price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   **Quantity Demanded**: But consumers only demand 1,300 pounds because the price is too high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
*   **Result**: This leads to a [[shortages_and_surpluses_in_markets | surplus]] of 1,700 pounds of apples (3,000 supplied - 1,300 demanded) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   **Market Adjustment**: With a [[shortages_and_surpluses_in_markets | surplus]], producers may get desperate as apples might spoil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. They will start reducing the price to attract consumers, and simultaneously reduce the quantity produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. This moves the market down the supply curve and increases the quantity demanded along the demand curve, again moving closer to equilibrium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

## The Equilibrium Point

Both [[shortages_and_surpluses_in_markets | shortages]] and [[shortages_and_surpluses_in_markets | surpluses]] naturally push the market towards a single point where the demand and supply curves intersect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   **Equilibrium Price**: This is the price at which the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. In the apple market example, this might be around $2.15 per pound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
*   **Equilibrium Quantity**: This is the quantity where supply and demand meet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>, for instance, approximately 2,200 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

At the equilibrium price and quantity, all apples produced are sold, and none go bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. This is considered a beneficial scenario for both consumers and producers, assuming no other factors change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

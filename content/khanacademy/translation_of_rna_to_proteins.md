The genetic information stored in [[dna_and_its_function_in_cells | DNA]] must be expressed to define an organism and produce functional molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. This process of [[concept_of_gene_expression | gene expression]] involves [[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | RNA]] as a crucial intermediary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

## From DNA to Protein: The Role of RNA

A [[gene]] is a section of [[dna_and_its_function_in_cells | DNA]] that codes for a specific protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. To express this information, the cell utilizes [[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | RNA]], or ribonucleic acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

### Transcription
In cells with nuclei, [[dna_and_its_function_in_cells | DNA]] resides within the nucleus, but its information often needs to be outside the nucleus to be expressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. [[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | RNA]] serves as a messenger, specifically messenger [[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | RNA]] (mRNA), to carry this information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. The process of going from [[dna_and_its_function_in_cells | DNA]] to mRNA is called **transcription** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

During transcription, a section of [[dna_and_its_function_in_cells | DNA]] (a gene) is used as a template to construct a corresponding mRNA molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. While in [[dna_and_its_function_in_cells | DNA]] adenine (A) pairs with thymine (T), in [[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | RNA]], adenine pairs with uracil (U) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. Cytosine (C) still pairs with guanine (G) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. Once transcribed, the single strand of mRNA detaches from the [[dna_and_its_function_in_cells | DNA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

### Translation: From mRNA to Protein
After transcription, the mRNA molecule leaves the nucleus and attaches to a [[organelle_functions_such_as_ribosomes_endoplasmic_reticulum_and_golgi_bodies | ribosome]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. The process by which this mRNA code is used to create proteins is called **translation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. Translation involves converting the base pair sequence of mRNA into an amino acid sequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

**Codons**
Every sequence of three bases on the mRNA molecule is called a codon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. Each codon codes for a specific amino acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. With four possible bases (A, U, C, G) and three positions in a codon, there are 4 x 4 x 4 = 64 possible codons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. This is more than enough to code for the 20 possible amino acids, allowing for some amino acids to be coded by more than one codon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.

**Role of tRNA**
Another type of [[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | RNA]], transfer [[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | RNA]] (tRNA), plays a crucial role in translation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. tRNA molecules match specific codons on the mRNA with their corresponding amino acids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. The [[organelle_functions_such_as_ribosomes_endoplasmic_reticulum_and_golgi_bodies | ribosome]] facilitates this matching process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. As tRNAs bring amino acids to the [[organelle_functions_such_as_ribosomes_endoplasmic_reticulum_and_golgi_bodies | ribosome]] based on the mRNA codons, these amino acids are linked together in a specific sequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

## Proteins: The Workhorses of Life
The sequence of amino acids assembled during translation forms a protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. Proteins are the molecules that primarily carry out the functions of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. They can be enzymes, structural components (like muscle), or perform many other vital roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. Proteins can be thousands of amino acids long and fold into complex, functional shapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. This entire process, from [[dna_and_its_function_in_cells | DNA]] to [[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | RNA]] to protein, illustrates how the information for life is stored and expressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

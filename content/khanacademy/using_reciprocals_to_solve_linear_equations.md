This article explores how to [[solving_algebraic_equations | solve algebraic equations]], specifically [[linear_equations | linear equations]], by using the reciprocal of the coefficient of the variable. This method is particularly useful when dealing with fractions.

## Understanding Basic Linear Equations

A [[linear_equations | linear equation]] typically involves a variable (like 'x') multiplied by a number, set equal to another number. For example, the equation `5x = 20` means "5 times question mark equals 20" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. In algebraic notation, when a number is written directly next to a variable, it implies multiplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

While many simple equations can be [[solving_simple_linear_equations | solved]] mentally (e.g., 5 times what equals 20? The answer is 4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, a systematic approach is necessary for more complex numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Two Ways to Solve Simple Equations

For an equation like `5x = 20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>:

1.  **Dividing by the Coefficient**: You can divide both sides of the equation by the number multiplying 'x' (the coefficient). In this case, dividing both sides by 5 yields `x = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
2.  **Multiplying by the Reciprocal**: This is mathematically the same as dividing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Instead of dividing by 5, you can multiply both sides by 1/5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Since 1/5 times 5 is 1, the left side simplifies to `x`, resulting in `x = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

Multiplying by the reciprocal becomes particularly advantageous when the coefficient is a fraction, as it simplifies the process significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

## Solving Equations with Fractions and Negative Numbers

Consider a more challenging [[linear_equations | linear equation]]: `negative 3/4 * x = 10/13` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. This requires [[algebraic_techniques_for_solving_equations | algebraic techniques]] rather than mental math <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

To [[solving_linear_equations_involving_negative_numbers | solve]] this, multiply both sides by the reciprocal of the coefficient on 'x' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

> [!definition] Coefficient
> The term "coefficient" refers to the number that is being multiplied by the variable (e.g., in `-3/4x`, `-3/4` is the coefficient) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

The reciprocal of -3/4 is -4/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1.  **Identify the equation**: `-3/4x = 10/13` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>
2.  **Multiply by the reciprocal**: Multiply both sides by -4/3.
    *   `(-4/3) * (-3/4x) = (10/13) * (-4/3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>
    *   *Note on notation:* A dot `.` or parentheses `()` can also represent multiplication in algebra to avoid confusion with the variable `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
3.  **Simplify the left side**: The -4/3 and -3/4 cancel out, leaving `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
4.  **Calculate the right side**:
    *   Numerator: `10 * (-4) = -40` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>
    *   Denominator: `13 * 3 = 39` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>
    *   So, `x = -40/39` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Improper fractions are often preferred for ease of calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

### Checking Your Answer

A valuable aspect of [[solving_algebraic_equations | algebra]] is the ability to check your answer by substituting it back into the original equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

Original equation: `-3/4 * x = 10/13` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>
Substitute `x = -40/39`: `(-3/4) * (-40/39) = 10/13` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>

When multiplying fractions, you can simplify diagonally before multiplying:
*   The 4 in the denominator and the 40 in the numerator can be divided by 4 (4 becomes 1, 40 becomes 10) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   The negative signs cancel out, resulting in a positive product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
*   `(-3/1) * (-10/39) = 30/39` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   Simplify 30/39 by dividing both by 3, which gives `10/13` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

Since 10/13 equals 10/13, the answer is correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

## Another Example

Let's [[working_with_fractions_in_linear_equations | solve]] `minus 5/6x = 7/8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

1.  **Find the reciprocal**: The reciprocal of -5/6 is -6/5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
2.  **Multiply both sides**: `(-6/5) * (-5/6x) = (7/8) * (-6/5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
3.  **Simplify**:
    *   Left side becomes `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
    *   Right side: Divide 6 and 8 by 2 (6 becomes -3, 8 becomes 4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
    *   Numerator: `7 * (-3) = -21` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>
    *   Denominator: `4 * 5 = 20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>
    *   Therefore, `x = -21/20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

### Checking the Answer

Substitute `x = -21/20` into the original equation: `(-5/6) * (-21/20) = 7/8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

*   Negative times negative is positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
*   Simplify diagonally:
    *   5 and 20 (divide by 5: 5 becomes 1, 20 becomes 4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
    *   6 and 21 (divide by 3: 6 becomes 2, 21 becomes 7) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
*   Multiply remaining terms: `(1/2) * (7/4) = 7/8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

The result matches the original equation, confirming the answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

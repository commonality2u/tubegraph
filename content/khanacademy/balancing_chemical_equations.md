[[Balancing chemical equations | Balancing chemical equations]] is a fundamental concept in chemistry that can initially seem confusing, but becomes manageable with careful and methodical practice, appreciating it as an "art" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## What is a Chemical Equation?

A [[introduction_to_chemical_equations | chemical equation]] describes a chemical reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. For example, the reaction where an atom of aluminum combines with a dioxygen molecule to form aluminum oxide can be represented by a chemical equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. In this specific reaction, aluminum oxide molecules are composed of two aluminum atoms and three oxygen atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Why Balance Chemical Equations?

The need to [[basics_of_balancing_chemical_equations | balance chemical equations]] arises because the number of each type of atom must be the same on both sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This principle is rooted in the [[conservation_of_mass_in_chemical_reactions | conservation of mass]]: atoms cannot magically appear or disappear during a reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

Consider the example of aluminum reacting with dioxygen to form aluminum oxide:
Initially, an unbalanced equation might show:
*   **Left-hand side (reactants):** One aluminum atom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, two oxygen atoms (in one dioxygen molecule) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   **Right-hand side (products):** Two aluminum atoms and three oxygen atoms (in one aluminum oxide molecule) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

This state is unbalanced because the number of aluminum atoms (one on the left vs. two on the right) and oxygen atoms (two on the left vs. three on the right) are not equal on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## [[Steps to balance a chemical equation | Steps to Balance a Chemical Equation]]

To [[methods_to_solve_balancing_equations | balance an equation]], the goal is to adjust the coefficients (the numbers in front of the chemical formulas) so that the count of each type of atom is identical on both the reactant and product sides.

### Initial Balancing Attempts

1.  **Balance Aluminum:** To balance aluminum, one might start by doubling the number of aluminum atoms on the left-hand side by adding a coefficient of '2' in front of aluminum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
    *   This makes the aluminum atoms balanced: two on the left, two on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
2.  **Balance Oxygen:** With aluminum balanced, the oxygen atoms still need adjustment. The left side has two oxygen atoms (from O₂) and the right side has three (from Al₂O₃) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. One might consider multiplying the dioxygen molecule on the left by 1.5 to get three oxygen atoms (1.5 * 2 = 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

### The [[whole_number_convention_in_chemical_equations | Whole Number Convention]]

A key [[common_challenges_in_balancing_equations | challenge]] and convention in balancing chemical equations is that coefficients must be whole numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Using "1.5 molecules" is not acceptable as molecules are considered whole units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

To address this, similar to [[balaning_equations_by_performing_operations_on_both_sides | algebraic equations]], multiply all coefficients by a common factor that eliminates any fractions or decimals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. In this case, multiplying all current coefficients by two (to eliminate the 1.5) will achieve the [[whole_number_convention_in_chemical_equations | whole number convention]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### Final Balanced Equation

Starting with the equation as it was after the 1.5 was considered for oxygen:
2 Al + 1.5 O₂ → 1 Al₂O₃

Multiply all coefficients by 2:
*   2 (from 2 Al) becomes 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   1.5 (from 1.5 O₂) becomes 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   1 (from 1 Al₂O₃, implicitly) becomes 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

The balanced chemical equation becomes:
**4Al + 3O₂ → 2Al₂O₃** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>

### Verification of [[examples_of_balancing_different_types_of_equations | Examples of balancing different types of equations]]

*   **Aluminum (Al):**
    *   Left side: 4 aluminum atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
    *   Right side: 2 molecules of Al₂O₃, each containing 2 aluminum atoms, so 2 * 2 = 4 aluminum atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. (Balanced)
*   **Oxygen (O):**
    *   Left side: 3 molecules of O₂, each containing 2 oxygen atoms, so 3 * 2 = 6 oxygen atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
    *   Right side: 2 molecules of Al₂O₃, each containing 3 oxygen atoms, so 2 * 3 = 6 oxygen atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. (Balanced)

With both elements balanced, the chemical equation is now correctly balanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

[[introduction_to_balancing_chemical_equations | Balancing chemical equations]] is a fundamental concept taught in first-year chemistry, though it can be challenging for many students due to its artistic nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It involves ensuring that the number of atoms for each element is the same on both sides of a chemical equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## What is a Chemical Equation?
A chemical equation describes a chemical reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. For example, when aluminum reacts with oxygen gas to form aluminum oxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The substances that react are called [[understanding_reactants_and_products_in_chemical_reactions | reactants]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, and the substances formed are the [[understanding_reactants_and_products_in_chemical_reactions | products]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

Initially, a chemical equation might not be balanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. For instance, in the reaction of aluminum and oxygen:
`Al + O₂ → Al₂O₃` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>

In this equation:
*   On the left (reactant) side, there is one aluminum atom and two oxygen atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   On the right (product) side, there are two aluminum atoms and three oxygen atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

The goal of [[introduction_to_balancing_chemical_equations | balancing chemical equations]] is to ensure that the number of atoms of each element is consistent on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## [[examples_of_balancing_chemical_equations | Examples of Balancing Chemical Equations]]

### Example 1: Aluminum and Oxygen
To balance the equation `Al + O₂ → Al₂O₃`:
1.  **Balance Aluminum**: There is one aluminum on the left and two on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Place a '2' in front of aluminum on the left side:
    `2Al + O₂ → Al₂O₃` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>
    Now, there are two aluminums on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

2.  **Balance Oxygen**: There are two oxygens on the left and three on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. To balance them, you can use a fractional coefficient initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. If you multiply O₂ by 1.5 (or 3/2), it will result in three oxygens:
    `2Al + 1.5O₂ → Al₂O₃` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>
    Now, there are three oxygens on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

3.  **Eliminate Fractional Coefficients**: You cannot have half an atom or molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. To resolve this, multiply all coefficients in the entire equation by the smallest whole number that eliminates the fraction (in this case, 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>:
    `(2Al + 1.5O₂ → Al₂O₃) * 2`
    `4Al + 3O₂ → 2Al₂O₃` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>
    This yields four aluminum atoms and six oxygen atoms on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

### Common Mistake: Modifying Molecular Ratios
A [[common_mistakes_in_balancing_chemical_equations | common mistake]] is attempting to change the subscripts within a molecule (e.g., changing Al₂O₃ to Al₂O₂) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. You cannot change the relative ratios of atoms within a molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>; you can only change the number of whole molecules present by adjusting the coefficients in front of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### Example 2: Methane Combustion
Consider the reaction of methane gas with oxygen gas to yield carbon dioxide gas and liquid water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>:
`CH₄(g) + O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + H₂O(l)`

**General Strategy**: Balance complicated molecules first, and save single-atom molecules (like O₂) for last, as they are easier to adjust without affecting other elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

1.  **Balance Carbon (C)**: There is one carbon on the left and one carbon on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. Carbons are already balanced.

2.  **Balance Hydrogen (H)**: There are four hydrogen atoms on the left (in CH₄) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. On the right, there are two hydrogen atoms (in H₂O) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. Place a '2' in front of H₂O to get four hydrogens:
    `CH₄(g) + O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(l)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>

3.  **Balance Oxygen (O)**: On the right side, there are two oxygens from CO₂ and two oxygens from 2H₂O (2 * 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. This totals four oxygens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. On the left side, there are two oxygens in O₂ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. To balance, place a '2' in front of O₂:
    `CH₄(g) + 2O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(l)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>

    Now the equation is balanced: 1 C, 4 H, 4 O on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

### Example 3: Ethane Combustion
Consider the combustion of ethane:
`C₂H₆ + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>

1.  **Balance Carbon (C)**: There are two carbons on the left (in C₂H₆) and one on the right (in CO₂) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Place a '2' in front of CO₂:
    `C₂H₆ + O₂ → 2CO₂ + H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>

2.  **Balance Hydrogen (H)**: There are six hydrogens on the left (in C₂H₆) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. On the right, there are two hydrogens (in H₂O) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. Place a '3' in front of H₂O to get six hydrogens:
    `C₂H₆ + O₂ → 2CO₂ + 3H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>

3.  **Balance Oxygen (O)**: On the right side, there are four oxygens from 2CO₂ (2 * 2) and three oxygens from 3H₂O (3 * 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>, totaling seven oxygens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. On the left side, there are two oxygens in O₂ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. To get seven oxygens on the left, you would need to multiply O₂ by 3.5 (or 7/2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>:
    `C₂H₆ + 3.5O₂ → 2CO₂ + 3H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>

4.  **Eliminate Fractional Coefficients**: Multiply the entire equation by 2 to remove the 3.5 coefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>:
    `(C₂H₆ + 3.5O₂ → 2CO₂ + 3H₂O) * 2`
    `2C₂H₆ + 7O₂ → 4CO₂ + 6H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>

    Verify the balance:
    *   Carbon: 2 * 2 = 4 (left), 4 * 1 = 4 (right) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>
    *   Hydrogen: 2 * 6 = 12 (left), 6 * 2 = 12 (right) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>
    *   Oxygen: 7 * 2 = 14 (left), (4 * 2) + (6 * 1) = 8 + 6 = 14 (right) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>
    The equation is balanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

### Example 4: Balancing with Complex Groups (Sulfate)
Some equations feature complex ion groups that remain intact throughout the reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. In such cases, you can treat these groups as single "atoms" to simplify the balancing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

Consider:
`Fe₂O₃ + H₂SO₄ → Fe₂(SO₄)₃ + H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>

Here, the sulfate group (SO₄) stays together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Let's substitute SO₄ with 'X' to simplify:
`Fe₂O₃ + H₂X → Fe₂X₃ + H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>

1.  **Balance Iron (Fe)**: There are two irons on the left and two on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. Iron is balanced.

2.  **Balance Oxygen (O - outside of X group)**: There are three oxygens on the left (in Fe₂O₃) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. There is one oxygen on the right (in H₂O) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. Place a '3' in front of H₂O:
    `Fe₂O₃ + H₂X → Fe₂X₃ + 3H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>

3.  **Balance Hydrogen (H)**: On the right side, there are six hydrogens from 3H₂O (3 * 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. On the left side, there are two hydrogens (in H₂X) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. Place a '3' in front of H₂X:
    `Fe₂O₃ + 3H₂X → Fe₂X₃ + 3H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>

4.  **Balance Sulfate (X) Group**: On the left, there are three 'X' groups from 3H₂X <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. On the right, there are three 'X' groups from Fe₂X₃ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. The 'X' groups are balanced.

Now, substitute SO₄ back in for 'X':
`Fe₂O₃ + 3H₂SO₄ → Fe₂(SO₄)₃ + 3H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>
This equation is balanced.

### Example 5: Carbon Dioxide and Hydrogen
Consider:
`CO₂ + H₂ → CH₄ + H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>

1.  **Balance Carbon (C)**: One carbon on the left, one on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. Carbon is balanced.

2.  **Balance Oxygen (O)**: Two oxygens on the left (in CO₂) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. One oxygen on the right (in H₂O) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. Place a '2' in front of H₂O:
    `CO₂ + H₂ → CH₄ + 2H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>

3.  **Balance Hydrogen (H)**: On the right side, there are four hydrogens from CH₄ and four hydrogens from 2H₂O (2 * 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>, totaling eight hydrogens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. On the left side, there are two hydrogens (in H₂) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. Place a '4' in front of H₂:
    `CO₂ + 4H₂ → CH₄ + 2H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>
    The equation is now balanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.

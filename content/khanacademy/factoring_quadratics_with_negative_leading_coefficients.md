A quadratic, also known as a second-degree polynomial, is an expression where the variable is raised to the second power, commonly represented as `x²` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. When [[factoring_quadratic_polynomials | factoring quadratic polynomials]], if the leading coefficient (the number in front of the `x²` term) is negative, an initial step is required before applying standard [[factoring_quadratic_equations | factoring quadratic equations]] methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

## General Approach

The easiest way to [[solving_quadratic_equations | solve]] [[factoring_quadratic_polynomials | quadratic polynomials]] with a negative leading coefficient is to [[dealing_with_negative_numbers_in_equations | factor out -1]] from the entire expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. This converts the leading coefficient to positive 1, allowing the use of standard [[factoring_polynomials | factoring polynomial]] techniques where you find two numbers that multiply to the constant term and add to the coefficient of the `x` term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

### Example 1: `−x² − 5x + 24`

To factor the expression `−x² − 5x + 24` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>:

1.  **[[dealing_with_negative_numbers_in_equations | Factor out -1]]**:
    `−x² − 5x + 24` becomes `−1 * (x² + 5x − 24)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.
    This step effectively divides each term by -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>.

2.  **Find two numbers (a and b)**:
    For the expression `x² + 5x − 24`, find two numbers `a` and `b` such that:
    *   `a * b = −24` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>
    *   `a + b = 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>

    Since the product is negative, one number must be positive and the other negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Considering factors of 24, if you try `-3` and `8`:
    *   `-3 * 8 = -24` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>
    *   `-3 + 8 = 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>
    These numbers satisfy the conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

3.  **Write the factored form**:
    The expression can be factored as `−1 * (x − 3) * (x + 8)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.

### Example 2: `−x² + 18x − 72`

To factor the expression `−x² + 18x − 72` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>:

1.  **[[dealing_with_negative_numbers_in_equations | Factor out -1]]**:
    `−x² + 18x − 72` becomes `−1 * (x² − 18x + 72)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.

2.  **Find two numbers (a and b)**:
    For `x² − 18x + 72`, find `a` and `b` such that:
    *   `a * b = 72` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>
    *   `a + b = −18` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>

    Since the product is positive and the sum is negative, both numbers must be negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. Considering factors of 72, if you try `-6` and `-12`:
    *   `-6 * -12 = 72`
    *   `-6 + -12 = -18` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>
    These numbers satisfy the conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.

3.  **Write the factored form**:
    The expression is factored as `−1 * (x − 6) * (x − 12)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>.

> [!tip] Practice
> This process, like much of [[understanding_quadratic_expressions | understanding quadratic expressions]] and [[solving_difficult_quadratic_equations | solving difficult quadratic equations]], requires practice. [[Working_with_positive_and_negative_factors_in_quadratics | Working with positive and negative factors in quadratics]] and testing combinations of factors will become more intuitive with experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.

Geometry, derived from the Greek root "geo" (earth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a> and "metry" (measurement) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, literally means "earth measurement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. It is the study of how shapes and space relate to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, encompassing concepts like lines, triangles, circles, angles, patterns, and three-dimensional shapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Essentially, most visually mathematical concepts can be categorized within [[introduction_to_geometry_terms | geometry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Basic Geometric Concepts

### Points

The fundamental starting point in geometry is a [[understanding_points_and_dimensions | point]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   A point is a dot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a> that represents a specific position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   It is impossible to move *on* a point; any movement means you are no longer at that point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   Points are typically labeled with capital letters, such as Point A, Point B, Point C, or Point D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   A point is considered to have [[matrix_dimensions_and_types | zero dimensions]] because there are no options for movement while remaining on it (no up, down, left, right, in, or out) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

### One-Dimensional Objects

To move from one point to another, we introduce one-dimensional objects:

*   **Line Segment**
    *   A line segment consists of all points that connect two specific points along a straight path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
    *   The two specific points are called the *endpoints* of the line segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
    *   A line segment is denoted by its endpoints with a line drawn above them (e.g., AB or BA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
    *   Unlike a point, a line segment allows movement back and forth along its path, making it a [[basic_concepts_in_onedimensional_motion | one-dimensional object]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
    *   A pure geometric line segment has no width, only length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
    *   The length of a line segment AB is referred to simply as "AB" without the line symbol above it. For example, "AB = 5 units" means the length of line segment AB is five units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
    *   Line segments are commonly used when discussing sides of shapes or distances between points, as they have finite lengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

*   **Ray**
    *   A ray starts at one point (called the *vertex* of the ray) and extends infinitely in one direction through another point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
    *   It is a [[matrix_dimensions_and_types | one-dimensional figure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
    *   A ray is denoted by its starting point and another point it passes through, with an arrow indicating the direction of infinite extension (e.g., AD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. The order of letters matters; ray AD is different from ray DA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

*   **Line**
    *   In geometry, a line is an object that extends infinitely in both directions through two given points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
    *   Unlike a line segment, a line never ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
    *   A line is denoted by two points on it with arrows on both ends of the line symbol above them (e.g., EF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
    *   Line segments are sometimes simply called "segments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

### Collinear Points and Midpoint

*   **Collinear Points**: Points that all lie on the same straight line are called collinear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.
*   **Midpoint**: If a point Z is on a line segment XY, and the distance from X to Z is equal to the distance from Z to Y (XZ = ZY), then Z is the midpoint of the line segment XY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. The midpoint is exactly halfway between the two endpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

## Dimensions Beyond One

### Two-Dimensional Space (Planes)

*   To have [[matrix_dimensions_and_types | two dimensions]], an object must allow movement forwards and backwards in two different directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
*   A screen or a page is an example of a two-dimensional object because you can move left/right and up/down on its surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.
*   Things that are two-dimensional are called *planar*, or *planes* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
*   A plane is a geometric concept representing a flat surface that extends infinitely in every direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.
*   A physical piece of paper could be considered a "plane segment," as it is a finite segment of an entire plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

### Three-Dimensional Space

*   [[matrix_dimensions_and_types | Three-dimensional space]] allows movement in three different directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.
*   In addition to left/right and up/down, three-dimensional space includes the ability to move in and out (e.g., towards or away from a screen) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

### Higher Dimensions

*   In higher mathematics, concepts with more than three dimensions can be studied, although they become very difficult to visualize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

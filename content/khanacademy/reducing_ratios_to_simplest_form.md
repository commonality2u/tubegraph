Ratios are expressions that compare quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. They serve as a way to compare two or more quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Expressing Ratios

Ratios can be written in several ways:
*   Using a colon: 10:5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>
*   As a fraction: 10/5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>
*   Using the word "to": 10 to 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>

All these forms convey the same comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The quantity written first or on top corresponds to the first item in the comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## The Concept of Simplest Form

A ratio tells you the proportional relationship between quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. For instance, a ratio of 10 horses to 5 dogs (10:5) means that for every 5 dogs, there are 10 horses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This can be understood as 2 horses for every 1 dog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

The general convention is to express ratios in their [[simplifying_fractions_to_lowest_terms | simplest form]] or [[simplifying_fractions | reduced form]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

## How to Reduce Ratios

To reduce a ratio to its [[simplifying_fractions | simplest form]], you need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numbers in the ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Then, divide each number in the ratio by this GCD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

### Example: Horses to Dogs
If you have 10 horses and 5 dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, the ratio of horses to dogs is 10:5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
1.  **Identify the numbers**: 10 and 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
2.  **Find the greatest common divisor**: The largest number that divides into both 10 and 5 is 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
3.  **Divide both numbers by the GCD**:
    *   10 ÷ 5 = 2
    *   5 ÷ 5 = 1
4.  **Result**: The ratio in reduced form is 2:1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. This can also be written as 2/1 or "2 to 1" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### Importance of Order
The order of quantities in a ratio is crucial. If the question asks for the ratio of dogs to horses instead of horses to dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>:
*   The ratio of dogs to horses would be 5:10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   Dividing both by their GCD, 5, gives 1:2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   This can be written as 1/2 or "1 to 2" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### Reducing Ratios with Multiple Quantities
The same principle applies to ratios comparing more than two quantities.
For example, if you have 20 apples, 40 oranges, and 60 strawberries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>, the ratio of apples to oranges to strawberries is 20:40:60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

1.  **Identify the numbers**: 20, 40, and 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
2.  **Find the greatest common divisor for all quantities**: The largest number that divides into 20, 40, and 60 is 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
3.  **Divide all numbers by the GCD**:
    *   20 ÷ 20 = 1
    *   40 ÷ 20 = 2
    *   60 ÷ 20 = 3
4.  **Result**: The reduced ratio of apples to oranges to strawberries is 1:2:3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

As with two-quantity ratios, the order matters. If the ratio of strawberries to oranges to apples was requested, it would be 3:2:1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Whatever order the items are requested, the ratio should be presented in that exact order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

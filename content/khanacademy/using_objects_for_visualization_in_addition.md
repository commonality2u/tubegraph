When learning basic addition, visualizing numbers with objects can make the process more intuitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This method helps to count quantities directly and understand the concept of combining groups.

## Basic Addition Examples

### 1 + 1

To calculate 1 plus 1, imagine you have one avocado <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. If someone gives you another avocado, you now have a total of two avocados <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Therefore, 1 + 1 = 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

### 3 + 4

For a slightly more complex problem like 3 plus 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, the same object visualization can be applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>:
1.  Start with three avocados <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
2.  Add four more avocados to that group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
3.  Counting the total reveals seven avocados <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
    Thus, 3 + 4 = 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## Commutative Property with Objects

The order of numbers in addition does not change the sum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. For example, 5 plus 6 is the same as 6 plus 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   If you have 5 avocados and are given 6, you will have 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   If you have 6 avocados and are given 5, you will still have 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

## Practical Application

When encountering addition problems that are initially daunting, drawing circles or other simple shapes to represent the numbers can be a helpful strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Over time, with practice, these problems will become memorized and can be solved quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. This visualization method is particularly useful when beginning to learn mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

> [!Tip]
> For additional help with exercises, hints can be provided that draw circles for you to count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. Alternatively, you can draw these circles yourself or use a [[number_line_visualization | number line]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

Estimating the actual number of COVID-19 cases in a given area can be done by considering factors such as deaths, estimations of mortality rate, time from infection to death, and how quickly the virus spreads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

## Estimated Mortality Rate

For calculation purposes, a mortality rate of 1% is often assumed, as it appears to be a reasonable estimate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. However, reported mortality rates have varied significantly:
*   As low as 0.6% in South Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   As high as approximately 5% in places like Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

## Impact of Hospital System Capacity

The variability in reported mortality rates suggests a direct correlation with the capacity of the healthcare system:
*   Higher mortality numbers tend to occur in regions where the hospital system is being overwhelmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   The mortality rate can change based on how well equipped the hospital system is to handle the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. If hospitals become overwhelmed in the next few weeks, the mortality rate is very likely to increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

### Influence of Public Action
Individual and collective actions can directly impact the mortality rate:
*   If people socially isolate and take proper precautions, the spread rate of the virus will decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
*   A slower spread rate helps prevent the hospital system from becoming overwhelmed, which in turn helps keep the mortality rate as low as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.
*   Conversely, complacency due to lagging [[differences_between_reported_and_actual_covid19_cases | reported data]] or a lack of [[impact_of_testing_on_reported_covid19_case_numbers | testing]] could lead to overwhelming the hospital system and increasing the mortality rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

## Other Factors Influencing Mortality Rate Calculations

The assumed mortality rate plays a critical role in [[estimating_actual_covid19_cases_from_deaths | estimating actual COVID-19 cases from deaths]]:
*   If a mortality rate of 1% is used, one death would suggest 100 people were infected approximately [[time_from_infection_to_death_estimation_in_covid19_cases | 20 days prior]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   If a 0.5% mortality rate were assumed, then 200 people might have been infected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
*   If a 5% mortality rate were assumed, then 20 people might have been infected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

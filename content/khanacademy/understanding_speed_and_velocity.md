This article explores the fundamental [[differences_between_vectors_and_scalars | differences between vectors and scalars]] and applies these concepts to distinguish between [[concept_of_distance_and_displacement | distance and displacement]], and ultimately, [[calculating_speed_and_velocity | speed and velocity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Vectors and Scalars

Despite potentially sounding complex, vectors and scalars are straightforward concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

*   A **vector** is a quantity that possesses both a magnitude (size) and a direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   A **scalar** is a quantity that only has a magnitude (size) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Distance vs. Displacement

To illustrate the difference, consider moving a brick 5 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

*   **Distance** is a [[examples_of_vector_and_scalar_quantities | scalar quantity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. If one only states that a brick moved "5 meters," this refers to the magnitude of the movement, or the distance traveled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Without a specified direction (e.g., right, left, up, down), it is impossible to know the precise path of movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Displacement** is a [[examples_of_vector_and_scalar_quantities | vector quantity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. If the movement is described as "5 meters to the right," both the magnitude (5 meters) and the direction (to the right) are specified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. Displacement is the vector version of distance, indicating the change in position with direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Therefore, one would say the brick was displaced "5 meters to the right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

## Speed vs. Velocity

Just as distance and displacement are related, so are speed and velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Consider the previous example where the brick moved 5 meters to the right in 2 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Time itself is generally considered a scalar quantity, as it primarily moves in one direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

*   **Speed** is a [[examples_of_vector_and_scalar_quantities | scalar quantity]] that measures how fast something is going without specifying direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. To [[calculating_speed_and_velocity | calculate speed]], divide the distance traveled by the time taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
    *   _Calculation_: 5 meters / 2 seconds = 2.5 meters per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
    *   This 2.5 meters per second represents the magnitude of the movement over time, but no direction is given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

*   **Velocity** is a [[examples_of_vector_and_scalar_quantities | vector quantity]] that specifies both the speed and the direction of an object's motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. To [[calculating_speed_and_velocity | calculate velocity]], divide the displacement by the time taken.
    *   _Calculation_: 5 meters to the right / 2 seconds = 2.5 meters per second to the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
    *   Here, 2.5 meters per second is the magnitude, and "to the right" is the direction, making it a vector quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

In summary:
*   **Displacement** is the vector equivalent of **distance** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   **Velocity** is the vector equivalent of **speed** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

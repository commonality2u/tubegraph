When learning [[basic_multiplication_concepts | multiplication]], understanding how the numbers 1 and 0 behave is crucial. These special cases follow consistent rules based on the idea of [[multiplication_as_repeated_addition | repeated addition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## Multiplication by One

Multiplying any number by one (or one by any number) results in the original number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

Consider the example of 3 times 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>:
*   **"Three 1's"**: This can be understood as adding the number 1 to itself three times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.
    > 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>
*   **"3 one time"**: This simply means the number 3, appearing once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
    > 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>

Both interpretations lead to the same result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>, demonstrating a key [[properties_of_multiplication | property of multiplication]]:
*   3 × 1 = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>
*   1 × 3 = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>

This rule applies to any number, no matter how large:
*   100 × 1 = 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>
*   1 × 39 = 39 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>

## Multiplication by Zero

Multiplying any number by zero (or zero by any number) always results in zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

Unlike addition where 3 + 0 = 3 (adding nothing to 3 leaves 3 apples) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>, multiplication with zero works differently.

Consider 4 times 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>:
*   **"Four 0's"**: This means adding the number 0 to itself four times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.
    > 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>
    If you have nothing, and add nothing, four times, you still have nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.
*   **"4 zero times"**: This implies that the number 4 appears zero times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.
    If there are no 4's present, the total is zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

Again, both interpretations yield the same result:
*   4 × 0 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>
*   0 × 17 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>

This rule holds true for any number:
*   5,493,692 × 0 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>

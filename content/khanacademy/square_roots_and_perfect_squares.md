## Understanding Radicals

A **radical** is a mathematical symbol typically represented by the square root symbol (√) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, also known as the square root symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Simplifying Radicals

Simplifying a radical involves rewriting it in a form where the number under the radical sign has no [[perfect_square_identification | perfect square]] factors other than 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

### Core Principle: Exponent Rules

Simplifying radicals is an extension of standard exponent rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. The square root of a number is equivalent to raising that number to the 1/2 power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

For example, the square root of (36 * 2) can be written as (36 * 2)^(1/2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. According to exponent rules, when multiplying two numbers and raising them to a power, you can raise each number to that power individually and then multiply the results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
So, (36 * 2)^(1/2) is equal to 36^(1/2) * 2^(1/2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, which translates back to the square root of 36 times the square root of 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### Steps for Simplification

1.  **Identify [[perfect_square_identification | Perfect Square]] Factors**: Find the largest [[perfect_square_identification | perfect square]] factor of the number under the radical sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. A [[perfect_square_identification | perfect square]] is a number that is the result of squaring an integer (e.g., 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
2.  **Factor the Number**: Rewrite the number under the radical as a product of its largest [[perfect_square_identification | perfect square]] factor and another number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
3.  **Separate the Radicals**: Apply the exponent rule (or radical property) to separate the radical into two multiplied radicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
4.  **Simplify the [[perfect_square_identification | Perfect Square]] Radical**: Take the square root of the [[perfect_square_identification | perfect square]] factor.
5.  **Multiply and Consolidate**: Multiply the simplified square root by any coefficients outside the radical and leave the remaining factor under its radical.

### Examples

#### Example 1: Simplifying √36
The square root of 36 is 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

#### Example 2: Simplifying √72
1.  Find the largest [[perfect_square_identification | perfect square]] factor of 72. That is 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
2.  Rewrite: √72 = √(36 * 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>
3.  Separate: √36 * √2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>
4.  Simplify: 6 * √2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>
    Therefore, √72 simplifies to 6√2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

#### Example 3: Simplifying √50
1.  The largest [[perfect_square_identification | perfect square]] factor of 50 is 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
2.  Rewrite: √50 = √(25 * 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>
3.  Separate: √25 * √2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>
4.  Simplify: 5 * √2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>
    Therefore, √50 simplifies to 5√2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

#### Example 4: Simplifying 7√27
1.  The largest [[perfect_square_identification | perfect square]] factor of 27 is 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
2.  Rewrite: 7 * √(9 * 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>
3.  Separate: 7 * √9 * √3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>
4.  Simplify: 7 * 3 * √3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>
5.  Multiply: 21√3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>
    Therefore, 7√27 simplifies to 21√3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

#### Example 5: Simplifying 9√18
1.  The largest [[perfect_square_identification | perfect square]] factor of 18 is 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
2.  Rewrite: 9 * √(2 * 9) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>
3.  Separate: 9 * √2 * √9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>
4.  Simplify: 9 * √2 * 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>
5.  Multiply: 27√2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>
    Therefore, 9√18 simplifies to 27√2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

#### Example 6: Simplifying 4√25
Since 25 is a [[perfect_square_identification | perfect square]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>:
1.  Simplify: 4 * 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>
2.  Multiply: 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>
    Therefore, 4√25 simplifies to 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

#### Example 7: Simplifying 3√29
29 is a prime number, meaning its only factors are 1 and 29 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Neither 1 nor 29 are [[perfect_square_identification | perfect squares]] (other than 1, which doesn't simplify further) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
Therefore, 3√29 cannot be simplified further and is already in its completely simplified form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

#### Example 8: Simplifying 7√320 (Multi-step Simplification)
For larger numbers, you can simplify in multiple steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
1.  Identify a [[perfect_square_identification | perfect square]] factor. 16 goes into 320 (320 = 16 * 20) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
2.  Rewrite: 7 * √(16 * 20) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>
3.  Separate: 7 * √16 * √20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>
4.  Simplify: 7 * 4 * √20 = 28√20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
5.  Check if √20 can be simplified further. Yes, 20 contains the [[perfect_square_identification | perfect square]] factor 4 (20 = 4 * 5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
6.  Rewrite: 28 * √(4 * 5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>
7.  Separate: 28 * √4 * √5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>
8.  Simplify: 28 * 2 * √5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>
9.  Multiply: 56√5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>
    Therefore, 7√320 simplifies to 56√5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
    This process continues until the number under the radical no longer has any [[perfect_square_identification | perfect square]] factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

Solving equations, particularly those with variables on both sides, can initially appear complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The primary goal in [[solving equations with variables | solving equations with variables]] is to [[solving simple linear equations | isolate the variable]] (e.g., 'x') on one side of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Once the variable is isolated, the equation is solved, and the answer can be verified by substituting it back into the original equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

While algebraic steps are sufficient for finding solutions, [[visualizing_and_understanding_equations | visualizing what occurs during each step]] can make the process more intuitive and prevent confusion about the rules of algebra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Visualizing the Equation: 2x + 3 = 5x - 2

To understand the manipulation of an equation, it can be helpful to represent its components visually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>:

*   **2x** can be imagined as two individual 'x' units (x + x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   **+3** can be represented as three positive units (+1, +1, +1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **5x** can be visualized as five individual 'x' units (x + x + x + x + x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   **-2** can be represented as two negative units (-1, -1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

Though not necessary for algebraic solution, this [[graphical_representation_of_linear_equations | visual approach]] clarifies the meaning of each term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

### Step 1: Combining 'x' Terms

The first step is to gather all 'x' terms on one side of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. It's often strategic to move terms such that the 'x' coefficient remains positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

*   **Algebraic Operation**: Subtract 2x from both sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
    2x + 3 - 2x = 5x - 2 - 2x
    3 = 3x - 2
*   **Visualization**: By "removing" two 'x' units from the left side, two 'x' units must also be removed from the right side to maintain balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. This leaves three 'x' units on the right and three positive units on the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### Step 2: Isolating the 'x' Terms

Next, eliminate constant terms from the side containing the 'x' variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

*   **Algebraic Operation**: Add 2 to both sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
    3 + 2 = 3x - 2 + 2
    5 = 3x
*   **Visualization**: Adding two positive units to the side with '-2' causes the negative units to cancel out (+1 cancels -1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. To keep the equation balanced, two positive units are also added to the left side, resulting in five positive units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

### Step 3: Solving for 'x'

The final step is to determine the value of a single 'x' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

*   **Algebraic Operation**: Divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of 'x' (which is 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
    5 / 3 = 3x / 3
    5/3 = x
    (or x = 1 2/3 as a mixed number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>)
*   **Visualization**: Dividing both sides by 3 means separating both the 5 positive units and the 3 'x' units into three equal groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. While easy for the 'x' terms (each group gets one 'x'), it's harder to visualize for fractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Each group on the left would contain 1 and 2/3 units, equating to one 'x' on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. This [[graphical_representation_of_solutions | graphical representation of solutions]] confirms the algebraic outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

The solution, x = 5/3 or x = 1 2/3, can be checked by substituting it into the original equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

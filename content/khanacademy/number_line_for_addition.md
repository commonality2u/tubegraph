The number line is a visual tool used to understand and perform [[basic_addition_concepts | addition]] problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. It's particularly helpful when you haven't memorized all basic addition facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.

## How to Use the Number Line for Addition

To use a number line for [[basic_addition_concepts | addition]], you start by writing numbers in order, typically beginning with 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.

1.  **Locate the first number:** Find the position of the first number in the addition problem on the number line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.
2.  **Move to the right:** To add, move to the right (or "up") on the number line by the amount of the second number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. Each step to the right counts as adding one.
3.  **Find the sum:** The number you land on after moving to the right is the sum of the addition problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.

### Examples

*   **3 + 4:**
    *   Start at 3 on the number line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.
    *   Move 4 steps to the right: 1, 2, 3, 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
    *   You land on 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. So, 3 + 4 = 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.
*   **8 + 1:**
    *   Start at 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.
    *   Move 1 step to the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.
    *   You land on 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. Adding 1 to any number simply results in the next consecutive number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.
*   **5 + 6:**
    *   Start at 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.
    *   Move 6 steps to the right: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.
    *   You land on 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>. So, 5 + 6 = 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.
*   **6 + 5:**
    *   Start at 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>.
    *   Move 5 steps to the right: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.
    *   You land on 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>. This demonstrates the [[commutative_property_of_addition | commutative property of addition]], where changing the order of the numbers in an addition problem does not change the sum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.
*   **8 + 7:**
    *   Start at 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>.
    *   Move 7 steps to the right: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>.
    *   You land on 15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>. So, 8 + 7 = 15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>.

## Benefits of Using the Number Line

The number line technique, along with drawing circles, can be used to solve [[basic_addition_concepts | addition]] problems when you are first learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>. With [[practice_techniques_for_addition | consistent practice]], you will eventually memorize these facts and be able to solve problems very quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>.

Addition can be visualized and solved using a number line, which is a method of writing numbers in order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:08">[02:08:08]</a>. This technique can be particularly helpful for those who haven't memorized basic addition facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:02">[02:02:02]</a>.

## How to use a number line for addition

To use a number line for addition, start by drawing a line and marking numbers on it, ensuring you go high enough to include all numbers in your problem and the potential answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:59">[02:10:59]</a>.

### Steps
1.  **Locate the first number:** Find the position of the first number in the addition problem on the number line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:48">[02:40:48]</a>.
2.  **Move to the right:** To add the second number, move to the right (up the number line) a number of spaces equal to the second number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:27">[02:44:27]</a>.
3.  **Identify the sum:** The number you land on after moving is the sum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:18">[03:02:18]</a>.

### Examples

#### Example 1: 3 + 4
To solve 3 + 4 using a number line:
1.  Start at 3 on the number line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:27">[02:39:27]</a>.
2.  Move 4 spaces to the right: 1, 2, 3, 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
3.  You will land on 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:18">[03:02:18]</a>.
Therefore, 3 + 4 = 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

#### Example 2: 8 + 1
For 8 + 1:
1.  Begin at 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:32">[03:16:32]</a>.
2.  Add 1 by moving one space to the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:24">[03:18:24]</a>.
3.  This brings you to 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.
So, 8 + 1 = 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. Adding 1 to any number always results in the "next number" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:26">[03:14:26]</a>.

#### Example 3: 5 + 6
To calculate 5 + 6:
1.  Start at 5 on the number line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:39">[04:58:39]</a>.
2.  Move 6 spaces to the right: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.
3.  You will arrive at 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>.
Thus, 5 + 6 = 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>. This is considered a "hard problem" if you rely on fingers, as the answer (11) has more digits than you have fingers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.

### Commutative Property of Addition
The number line can also demonstrate the [[commutative_property_of_addition | commutative property of addition]], which states that changing the order of the numbers being added does not change the sum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.
For example, to find 6 + 5:
1.  Start at 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:25">[05:34:25]</a>.
2.  Move 5 spaces to the right: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.
3.  You still land on 11, the same result as 5 + 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>.
This shows that 5 + 6 is the same as 6 + 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.

## Other visual methods for addition

Before using a number line, or as an alternative, [[basic_addition_with_visuals | basic addition with visuals]] can be done by drawing objects. For instance, to calculate 3 + 4, you can draw 3 "avocados" and then draw 4 more "avocados" and count them all to find the total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.

## Practice and Memorization

While visual aids like drawing circles or using a number line are helpful, consistent practice will eventually lead to memorization of basic addition facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. Over time, these problems will seem much easier and can be solved almost instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. Mathematics, especially at the beginner level, requires significant practice and some degree of memorization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>. Soon, you will also learn about [[multiplication as repeated addition | multiplication]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:47">[06:48:47]</a>.

[[overview_of_glycolysis | Glycolysis]] is the initial phase of [[impact_of_glycolysis_in_cellular_respiration | cellular respiration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The term "glycolysis" literally translates to the "breaking down of [[chemical_equation_of_glucose | glucose]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This process can occur either with or without the presence of oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. If oxygen is absent, the pathway proceeds to fermentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, which produces lactic acid in humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a> or alcohol/ethanol in other organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. When oxygen is available, the products of glycolysis advance to the Krebs cycle and subsequently the electron transport chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Phases of Glycolysis

[[glycolysis_phases_and_process | Glycolysis]] begins with a single molecule of [[chemical_equation_of_glucose | glucose]] (C6H12O6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, which is a six-carbon sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. The process is divided into two key [[atp_investment_and_payoff_phases_in_glycolysis | phases]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>:

1.  **Investment Phase**: In this initial [[atp_investment_and_payoff_phases_in_glycolysis | phase]], two molecules of [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATP]] are consumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. These [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATPs]] provide phosphate groups, leading to the breakdown of glucose into two 3-carbon compounds, such as phosphoglyceraldehyde (PGAL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
2.  **Payoff Phase**: Each of the two 3-carbon PGAL molecules then enters the [[atp_investment_and_payoff_phases_in_glycolysis | payoff phase]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. During this [[atp_investment_and_payoff_phases_in_glycolysis | phase]], each PGAL molecule is converted into pyruvate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a> (a 3-carbon compound) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. For each PGAL, two [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATPs]] are produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>, resulting in a total of four [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATPs]] from the two PGALs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. Additionally, each PGAL produces one [[role_of_nad_and_nadh_in_glycolysis | NADH]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, for a total of two [[role_of_nad_and_nadh_in_glycolysis | NADHs]] per glucose molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. The [[role_of_nad_and_nadh_in_glycolysis | NADH]] is formed when NAD+ is reduced by gaining a hydrogen (and its associated electrons) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

## Net Energy Yield

From one molecule of [[chemical_equation_of_glucose | glucose]], the [[functional_steps_and_enzymes_involved_in_glycolysis | functional steps]] of [[glycolysis_phases_and_process | glycolysis]] yield the following:

*   **Net [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATP]] produced**: Four [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATPs]] are generated in the [[atp_investment_and_payoff_phases_in_glycolysis | payoff phase]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>, while two [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATPs]] are consumed in the [[atp_investment_and_payoff_phases_in_glycolysis | investment phase]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. This results in a **net gain of two [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATPs]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **[[role_of_nad_and_nadh_in_glycolysis | NADH]] produced**: Two molecules of [[role_of_nad_and_nadh_in_glycolysis | NADH]] are produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. These [[role_of_nad_and_nadh_in_glycolysis | NADHs]] are crucial as they can later be used in the electron transport chain to generate approximately three [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATPs]] each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
*   **Pyruvate produced**: Two molecules of pyruvate are the final 3-carbon products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

## Overall Equation of Glycolysis

The simplified overall chemical equation for [[overview_of_glycolysis | glycolysis]] can be summarized as follows:

```
Glucose + 2 NAD⁺ + 2 ADP + 2 Pi → 2 Pyruvate + 2 NADH + 2 ATP
```

Let's break down the components of the reaction:

*   **Reactants (Inputs)**:
    *   One [[chemical_equation_of_glucose | glucose]] molecule (C6H12O6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>
    *   Two NAD+ molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>
    *   Two ADP (Adenosine Diphosphate) molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a> (net, considering 4 ADP become 4 ATP and 2 ATP are invested from 2 ADP)
    *   Two inorganic phosphate (Pi) groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a> (net)
*   **Products (Outputs)**:
    *   Two pyruvate molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>
    *   Two [[nad_reduction_to_nadh_during_glycolysis | NADH]] molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>
    *   Net of two [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATP]] molecules (4 gross produced - 2 invested) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>

In essence, [[glycolysis_phases_and_process | glycolysis]] splits [[chemical_equation_of_glucose | glucose]] into two pyruvates, while simultaneously producing a net gain of two [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATPs]] and two [[role_of_nad_and_nadh_in_glycolysis | NADHs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. These [[role_of_nad_and_nadh_in_glycolysis | NADHs]] and pyruvates serve as crucial raw materials for subsequent stages of [[impact_of_glycolysis_in_cellular_respiration | cellular respiration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

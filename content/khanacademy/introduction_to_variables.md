In basic arithmetic, one deals with concrete numbers, such as "23 plus 5" or "2 times 7," where the exact values are known and calculable [00:00:00]. As one moves into the algebraic world, the concept of [[random_variables | variables]] is introduced [00:00:20].

## What are Variables?
Variables are values within expressions that have the ability to change [00:00:30]. Their specific value can differ depending on the context in which they are used [00:01:34].

## Variables in Expressions
An expression is a statement of value or quantity [00:01:46]. For example, `x + 5` is an expression [00:00:38]. The value of this expression depends on the value assigned to the variable `x` [00:00:46].
*   If `x` is `1`, then `x + 5` evaluates to `1 + 5 = 6` [00:00:51].
*   If `x` is `-7`, then `x + 5` evaluates to `-7 + 5 = -2` [00:01:11].

An expression can contain multiple variables, such as `y + z` [00:02:11]. The value of this expression depends on the values of `y` and `z` [00:02:14]. For instance, if `y` is `1` and `z` is `2`, the expression is `1 + 2` [00:02:14]. If `y` is `0` and `z` is `-1`, it is `0 + (-1)` [00:02:18]. These expressions can be evaluated to yield a specific value based on the values of the variables within them [00:02:24].

## Expressions vs. Equations
It is crucial to understand the distinction between an expression and an equation [00:01:42].
*   **Expression**: A statement of value or quantity, like `x + 5` [00:01:46]. The value of an expression changes depending on the value of its variables [00:01:59].
*   **Equation**: An equation sets two expressions equal to each other [00:02:32]. The term "equation" comes from "equating" two things [00:02:35]. For example, `x + 3 = 1` is an equation [00:02:44].

In an equation, the variables might be constrained to a specific value [00:03:09]. For `x + 3 = 1`, `x` must be `-2` [00:03:03].

Equations can also involve multiple variables, such as `x + y + z = 5` [00:03:17]. In such cases, if some variables are known, the others can be constrained [00:03:32]. For instance, if `y = 3` and `z = 2` in the equation `x + y + z = 5`:
1.  The left side becomes `x + 3 + 2`, which simplifies to `x + 5` [00:03:51].
2.  The equation becomes `x + 5 = 5` [00:04:02].
3.  This constrains `x` to be `0` [00:04:11].

The key takeaway is that a variable's value can change depending on the problem's context [00:04:25].

## Evaluating Expressions with Variables
To further illustrate, consider evaluating expressions when variables are assigned different values:

### Example 1: `x` to the `y` power (`x^y`)
*   If `x = 5` and `y = 2` [00:04:47]:
    The expression `x^y` evaluates to `5^2 = 25` [00:04:55].
*   If `x = -2` and `y = 3` [00:05:16]:
    The expression `x^y` evaluates to `(-2)^3 = -2 * -2 * -2 = -8` [00:05:24].

### Example 2: Square root of `x + y` minus `x` (`√(x + y) - x`)
*   If `x = 1` and `y = 8` [00:06:09]:
    1.  Substitute the values: `√(1 + 8) - 1` [00:06:15].
    2.  Simplify under the radical: `√9 - 1` [00:06:32].
    3.  Calculate the square root: `3 - 1` [00:06:34].
    4.  The expression evaluates to `2` [00:06:48].

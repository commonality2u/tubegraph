[[solving_absolute_value_inequalities | Solving inequalities]] that involve absolute values can be confusing, but understanding the meaning of absolute value and [[graphical_representation_of_inequalities | visualizing them on a number line]] can make them intuitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Understanding Absolute Value
The absolute value of a number represents its distance from zero on a number line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. For example, the absolute value of `x`, written as `|x|`, means "how far away `x` is from 0" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Solving Absolute Value Inequalities
### Case 1: Absolute Value Less Than a Number (`|x| < a`)
Consider the inequality `|x| < 12` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This asks: "What are all the `x`'s that are less than 12 away from 0?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

To [[graphical_representation_of_inequalities | visualize]] this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>:
1.  Draw a number line with 0 at the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
2.  Mark positive 12 and negative 12 on the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
3.  Any number *between* negative 12 and positive 12 will have an absolute value less than 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
    *   For instance, `|-6| = 6`, which is less than 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
    *   `|-11| = 11`, which is less than 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

This implies two conditions: `x` must be greater than -12 AND `x` must be less than 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This can be written as a compound inequality: `-12 < x < 12` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

In [[interval_notation_in_solving_inequalities | interval notation]], the solution is `(-12, 12)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

### Case 2: Absolute Value Greater Than or Equal to a Number (`|f(x)| ≥ a`)
Consider the inequality `|7x| ≥ 21` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. This means that whatever is inside the absolute value (`7x`) must be 21 or more away from 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

To [[graphical_representation_of_inequalities | visualize]] this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>:
1.  Draw a number line with 0, positive 21, and negative 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
2.  For a number to be "more than 21 away from 0," it can either be:
    *   Greater than or equal to positive 21 (e.g., 22, 30) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
    *   Less than or equal to negative 21 (e.g., -22, -30), because their absolute values (`|-30|=30`) are greater than 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

This leads to two separate inequalities connected by "OR":
*   `7x ≤ -21` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a> OR `7x ≥ 21` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

Solving each:
*   `x ≤ -3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>
*   `x ≥ 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>

The actual solution set for `x` on a number line shows two separate regions: all numbers less than or equal to -3, and all numbers greater than or equal to 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. This is represented by solid circles at -3 and 3, with shading extending outwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

### General Rules for Absolute Value Inequalities
While understanding the visualization is key, patterns emerge that can be used as rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>:

*   **If `|f(x)| < a`**: This means `f(x)` is less than `a` units away from 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
    *   It translates to: `-a < f(x) < a` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
    *   Example: `|5x + 3| < 7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. This means `-7 < 5x + 3 < 7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
        *   Solving leads to `x > -2` and `x < 4/5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
        *   [[interval_notation_in_solving_inequalities | In interval notation]]: `(-2, 4/5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

*   **If `|f(x)| > a`**: This means `f(x)` is further than `a` units away from 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
    *   It translates to: `f(x) > a` OR `f(x) < -a` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
    *   Example: `|2x/7 + 9| > 5/7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. This means `2x/7 + 9 > 5/7` OR `2x/7 + 9 < -5/7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
        *   Solving the first: `x > -29` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.
        *   Solving the second: `x < -34` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
        *   The solution set on a number line would show regions where `x > -29` OR `x < -34` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. Open circles would be used as the inequalities are strict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.

The key is to always think about the distance from zero on the number line to avoid confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

The [[functions_of_the_kidney | kidney]] is primarily known for excreting waste, but it also plays a crucial role in maintaining proper water and salt (electrolyte) levels in the body, as well as blood pressure [00:00:32]. The smallest functional unit of the [[functions_of_the_kidney | kidney]] responsible for these [[processes_of_blood_filtration_and_waste_excretion | processes of blood filtration and waste excretion]] and water balance is the [[structure_and_function_of_the_nephron | nephron]] [00:00:08]. Each [[functions_of_the_kidney | kidney]] contains approximately one million [[structure and function of the nephron | nephrons]] [00:03:20].

## Initial Filtration: The Glomerulus and Bowman's Capsule

Blood enters the [[structure_and_function_of_the_nephron | nephron]] through the afferent arteriole and flows into a capillary network called the glomerulus [00:04:08]. This glomerulus is highly porous [00:05:05]. It is surrounded by a structure known as the Bowman's capsule, which contains specialized cells called podocytes that are selective about what gets filtered [00:06:06]. Due to high blood pressure in the arterial system, approximately one-fifth of the fluid from the blood is squeezed out into the Bowman's space within the Bowman's capsule [00:05:21]. This fluid is called filtrate [00:06:46].

The filtrate primarily consists of water and small molecules readily dissolved in fluid, such as small ions (sodium), glucose, and amino acids [00:07:07]. Larger molecules like red blood cells or large proteins are typically not filtered out [00:07:22].

## Reabsorption in the Proximal Tubule

Following filtration, the filtrate enters the proximal tubule [00:09:03]. The primary purpose of this section of the [[structure_and_function_of_the_nephron | nephron]] is to begin reabsorbing substances that the body needs and does not want to excrete, such as glucose, sodium, and amino acids [00:10:05].

This reabsorption is an [[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | active process]], meaning it requires energy in the form of ATP [00:10:35]. For instance, ATP is used to pump out sodium, which in turn facilitates the reabsorption of other substances [00:10:40]. A portion of the water from the filtrate is also reabsorbed here [00:11:24]. Without this reabsorption, the body would excrete gallons of water daily [00:11:36].

## Water and Salt Dynamics in the Loop of Henle

The filtrate then moves into the loop of Henle, a significant and often long part of the [[structure_and_function_of_the_nephron | nephron]] that dips down into the renal medulla before looping back up into the cortex [00:12:05]. This anatomical arrangement is crucial for water reabsorption [00:12:24].

The loop of Henle has two main segments with distinct permeabilities:
*   **Ascending Loop:** This part actively pumps out salts, including sodium, potassium, and chlorine ions, into the surrounding renal medulla [00:12:57]. This process consumes ATP as it moves ions against their [[concentration_gradients_and_equilibrium | concentration gradient]] [00:13:36]. A key feature of the ascending loop is its impermeability to water [00:13:53]. By actively pumping out salts, it makes the renal medulla highly concentrated, or [[hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | hypertonic]], relative to the fluid inside the tubule [00:13:27].
*   **Descending Loop:** In contrast, the descending loop is only permeable to water [00:14:06]. As the filtrate flows down into the salty ([[hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | hypertonic]]) medulla, water naturally moves out of the tubule and into the surrounding tissue through [[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | osmosis]] [00:14:24]. This is a major mechanism for water reabsorption [00:14:44]. The body cannot actively pump water, so it relies on creating a [[concentration_gradients_and_equilibrium | concentration gradient]] to draw water out passively [00:14:52]. The length of the loop of Henle allows sufficient time for this water reabsorption to occur [00:15:20].

## Further Reabsorption in the Distal Tubule and Collecting Ducts

After the loop of Henle, the filtrate enters the distal convoluted tubule [00:15:36]. Here, more reabsorption of substances like calcium and additional sodium occurs [00:16:24]. A small amount of water is also reabsorbed in this segment [00:16:36].

Finally, the processed filtrate, now much more concentrated and having had most of its useful components reabsorbed, enters the collecting ducts [00:16:41]. These ducts collect fluid from multiple [[structure_and_function_of_the_nephron | nephrons]] [00:17:05]. The collecting ducts also pass through the salty renal medulla [00:17:28]. The permeability of the collecting duct to water can be regulated by hormones, such as anti-diuretic hormone [00:17:46]. If the collecting duct is made more porous, more water will leave the filtrate (now considered urine) due to the surrounding salty environment, leading to even more concentrated urine and further water conservation [00:18:00]. The urine then leaves the [[functions_of_the_kidney | kidney]] via the ureters [00:18:19].

Car manufacturing is a highly complex process due to the sheer number of components involved and the sensitive nature of global supply chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Even a minor disruption can halt production.

## The Complexity of Car Production
A car is made of thousands of individual and unique components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. If even one of these components is missing, the manufacturing process cannot be completed, effectively stopping the production line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Supply Chain Fiascos: A Case Study
Elon Musk recounted a specific incident at the [[teslas_mission_and_impact_on_the_automotive_industry | Tesla]] factory in Fremont where production was halted due to a missing $3 USB cable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

### The Missing USB Cable
The $3 USB cable was a crucial part of the wiring harness, without which the car's interior could not be installed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This cable was "particularly pernicious" as it needed to be routed under the carpet in a difficult location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### The Impact on Production Efficiency
While it was possible to produce cars without the interior, this would lead to significant [[efficiency_and_optimality_in_production | inefficiencies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Cars would need to be stacked in a storage yard, and then workers would have to be sent out to hundreds of cars to install the missing component, disrupting the moving production line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

### Immediate Solution
To avoid further delays, [[teslas_mission_and_impact_on_the_automotive_industry | Tesla]] sent people throughout the Bay Area to physically buy USB cables from retail stores like Fry's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This immediate, unconventional solution allowed production to resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Global Supply Chain Vulnerabilities
The root cause of the missing cable highlighted critical vulnerabilities in the global supply chain:

*   **Supplier Issues (Plan A):** The supplier, located in China, grouped [[teslas_mission_and_impact_on_the_automotive_industry | Tesla]]'s parts with items for other companies and shipped them via a slow boat to LA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Upon arrival in LA, the other items failed customs inspection, causing [[teslas_mission_and_impact_on_the_automotive_industry | Tesla]]'s parts to be held up for several weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. The paperwork for the shipment was not in order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **Credit Limit Problems (Plan B):** To expedite the shipment, [[teslas_mission_and_impact_on_the_automotive_industry | Tesla]] tried to air freight the cables by ordering from the supplier's US subsidiary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. However, this second batch of parts doubled the order, exceeding [[teslas_mission_and_impact_on_the_automotive_industry | Tesla]]'s credit limit with the supplier, which resulted in the parts not being shipped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

Musk noted that such "farcical" situations and disruptions are a regular occurrence in manufacturing, given the sheer volume of processes and components involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

When solving a system of equations, such as two linear equations, there are primary methods to determine the values that satisfy both equations simultaneously. While [[graphical_representation_of_solutions | graphical representation of solutions]] offers a visual approach, [[algebraic_methods_in_algebra | algebraic methods]] provide precise numerical answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Limitations of Graphical Solutions

In a previous discussion, the concept of a system of equations was introduced, along with the idea of [[graphical_representation_of_linear_equations | graphing linear equations]] to find their intersection point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Each equation in a linear system represents a line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. These lines can be placed into various forms, such as slope-intercept or point-slope form, from their standard form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The solution to the system is the point where these lines intersect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

However, relying solely on [[graphing linear equations | graphing linear equations]] can be challenging because it's often difficult to visually identify the exact intersection point, leading to imprecise answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Algebraic Solutions: The Substitution Method

To overcome the imprecision of [[visualization techniques in solving equations | visualization techniques in solving equations]], [[algebraic_methods_in_algebra | algebraic methods]] offer a way to find an exact answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. One such technique is the **substitution method** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This method involves solving one equation for one variable and then substituting that expression into the other equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

### Example 1: Solving a System of Equations

Consider the following system of equations:
1.  x + 2y = 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
2.  3x + 5y = 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>

**Steps for the Substitution Method:**

1.  **Solve one equation for one variable:**
    From the first equation (x + 2y = 9), isolate x by subtracting 2y from both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>:
    x = 9 - 2y <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>

2.  **Substitute the expression into the other equation:**
    Substitute `(9 - 2y)` for `x` in the second equation (3x + 5y = 20) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>:
    3(9 - 2y) + 5y = 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>

3.  **Solve the resulting equation for the remaining variable:**
    This creates a single equation with only one unknown, `y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
    *   Distribute the 3: 27 - 6y + 5y = 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>
    *   Combine like terms: 27 - y = 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>
    *   Subtract 27 from both sides: -y = -7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>
    *   Multiply by -1: y = 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>

4.  **Substitute the found value back into the expression from Step 1 to find the other variable:**
    Using x = 9 - 2y, substitute y = 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>:
    x = 9 - 2(7) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>
    x = 9 - 14 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>
    x = -5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>

Thus, the solution is x = -5 and y = 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. This is the exact point where the two lines would intersect if [[graphing linear equations | graphed]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

### Checking Solutions

It's important to [[checking_solutions_in_algebra | check solutions]] by substituting the found values back into both original equations to ensure they are satisfied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   For x + 2y = 9: (-5) + 2(7) = -5 + 14 = 9. (Correct) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>
*   For 3x + 5y = 20: 3(-5) + 5(7) = -15 + 35 = 20. (Correct) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>

## Application to Word Problems

The substitution method is also highly effective for solving [[word_problems_in_algebra | word problems]] that can be translated into systems of equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

### Example 2: Finding Two Numbers

**Problem:** The sum of two numbers is 70, and they differ by 11. What are the numbers? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>

**Steps to Solve:**

1.  **Define variables:**
    Let x be the larger number and y be the smaller number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

2.  **Formulate equations from the problem statements:**
    *   "The sum of two numbers is 70": x + y = 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>
    *   "They differ by 11": x - y = 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>

    This creates a system of two equations with two unknowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

3.  **Solve using substitution:**
    *   From the second equation (x - y = 11), solve for x by adding y to both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>:
        x = 11 + y <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>
    *   Substitute this expression for x into the first equation (x + y = 70) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>:
        (11 + y) + y = 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>
    *   Combine like terms: 11 + 2y = 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>
    *   Subtract 11 from both sides: 2y = 59 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>
    *   Divide by 2: y = 59/2 or y = 29.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>
    *   Substitute y = 29.5 back into x = 11 + y <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>:
        x = 11 + 29.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>
        x = 40.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>

The two numbers are 40.5 and 29.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

### Checking Solutions for Word Problems

*   Sum: 40.5 + 29.5 = 70 (Correct) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>
*   Difference: 40.5 - 29.5 = 11 (Correct) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>

The key to algebraic solutions is using both constraints (equations) provided by the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. While the substitution method is demonstrated here, other [[algebraic_methods_in_algebra | algebraic methods]] for solving systems of equations will be explored in future discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

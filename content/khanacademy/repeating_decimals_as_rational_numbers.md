From: [[khanacademy]] <br/> 

[[definition_of_rational_numbers | Rational numbers]] are defined as any number that can be [[representation_of_rational_numbers_as_fractions | represented as the ratio of two integers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This definition extends beyond just integers or finite decimals to include [[repeating_decimals_and_notation | repeating decimals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Examples of Repeating Decimals as Ratios

A common example of a [[repeating_decimals_and_notation | repeating decimal]] is 0.333..., often denoted as 0.3 with a bar over the 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This number can be clearly represented as the fraction 1/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Similarly, 0.6 repeating can be represented as 2/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## General Principle

Any [[repeating_decimals_and_notation | repeating decimal]], regardless of the number of digits that repeat, can always be [[representation_of_rational_numbers_as_fractions | represented as the ratio of two integers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Even if a pattern of a million digits repeats itself indefinitely, it remains a rational number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Methods for how to [[converting_decimals_to_fractions | convert any repeating decimal]] into a [[representation_of_rational_numbers_as_fractions | ratio of two integers]] can be demonstrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

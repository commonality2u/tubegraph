[[recurring_decimals_representation | Repeating decimals]] are a specific type of decimal representation that are always considered [[rational_numbers_and_integer_representation | rational numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. A [[rational_numbers_and_integer_representation | rational number]] is defined as any number that can be represented as the ratio of two integers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Characteristics of Repeating Decimals

A [[recurring_decimals_representation | repeating decimal]] is a decimal where a sequence of digits after the decimal point repeats indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This is typically denoted by placing a bar over the repeating digit or sequence of digits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

### Conversion to Ratio of Two Integers

Any [[recurring_decimals_representation | repeating decimal]] can be [[decimals_to_fractions_conversion | converted]] into a [[fractional_representation_of_noninteger_rational_numbers | fraction]] (the ratio of two integers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

*   **Example 1: 0.3 repeating**
    The decimal 0.333... (or 0.3 repeating) is equivalent to 1/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Example 2: 0.6 repeating**
    The decimal 0.666... (or 0.6 repeating) is equivalent to 2/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

Even if a [[recurring_decimals_representation | repeating decimal]] has a very long repeating pattern (e.g., a million digits repeating), as long as the pattern repeats itself over and over again, it can always be represented as the ratio of two integers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. This property confirms that all [[recurring_decimals_representation | repeating decimals]] are, by definition, [[rational_numbers_and_integer_representation | rational numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

A [[definition_of_rational_numbers | rational number]] is any number that can be [[representations_of_rational_numbers | represented]] as the ratio of two integers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This means the number can be written as a fraction where both the numerator and the denominator are integers, and the denominator is not zero.

## Repeating Decimals Defined
[[understanding_repeating_decimals | Repeating decimals]] are decimals that have a sequence of digits that repeats infinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This repeating pattern is often indicated by a bar placed over the repeating digits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## Repeating Decimals as Rational Numbers
Despite their infinite nature, [[understanding_repeating_decimals | repeating decimals]] are considered [[definition_of_rational_numbers | rational numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. This is because any [[understanding_repeating_decimals | repeating decimal]] can be [[converting_decimals_to_fractions | converted]] into a fraction (the ratio of two integers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

### Examples:
*   **0.3 repeating**: This decimal, represented as 0.333... with a bar over the 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, is equivalent to 1/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **0.6 repeating**: This decimal is equivalent to 2/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### General Principle:
It is possible to [[converting_decimals_to_fractions | convert]] *any* [[understanding_repeating_decimals | repeating decimal]] into the ratio of two integers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. This holds true regardless of whether only one digit repeats or if a million digits repeat, as long as a pattern eventually begins to repeat itself indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

## Distinction from Irrational Numbers
The ability to represent [[understanding_repeating_decimals | repeating decimals]] as fractions contrasts them with irrational numbers. Irrational numbers, such as Pi (Ï€), *e*, the square root of 2, or Phi (the golden ratio), are non-terminating and non-repeating decimals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. They cannot be expressed as a simple ratio of two integers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

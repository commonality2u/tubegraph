Humanity has observed for thousands of years that different substances possess distinct properties and react with each other under specific circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For example, substances can vary in how they reflect light, their color, or their state (liquid, gas, solid) at a given temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Examples include carbon in graphite form, lead, and gold, all of which are depicted in their solid state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Elements and Atoms

The purest substances with specific properties that react in particular ways are called [[elements and the periodic table | elements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Carbon, lead, and gold are all [[elements and the periodic table | elements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Historically, water was considered an element, but it is now known to be composed of more basic [[elements and the periodic table | elements]]: oxygen and hydrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. All known [[elements and the periodic table | elements]] are listed in the [[elements and the periodic table | Periodic Table of Elements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

If an element is continually broken down into smaller and smaller chunks, there exists a smallest unit that still retains the properties of that substance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This fundamental unit is known as an atom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. For instance, breaking down carbon would eventually lead to a carbon atom, which is the smallest unit that maintains carbon's properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Atoms are incredibly small; for example, the width of an average human hair can accommodate approximately one million carbon atoms strung across it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

## Subatomic Particles: Protons, Neutrons, and Electrons

Atoms themselves are composed of even more fundamental particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>:
*   **Protons**: These fundamental particles define the element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. The number of protons in an atom's nucleus determines its atomic number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. For example, hydrogen always has one proton, helium has two, and carbon has six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Altering the number of protons changes the element itself (e.g., adding a proton to carbon makes it nitrogen) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Protons carry a positive charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.
*   **Neutrons**: Neutrons are neutral particles found alongside protons in the atom's nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. While the number of protons defines the element, the number of neutrons can vary within an element, creating different versions called isotopes (e.g., carbon-12 has six neutrons, while carbon-14 has eight) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
*   **Electrons**: Electrons are fundamental particles that carry a negative charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. In a neutral atom, the number of electrons is equal to the number of protons (e.g., carbon-12 has six electrons if it's neutral) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. Electrons are imagined to be moving around or buzzing around the nucleus, attracted by the positively charged protons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

## Electron Behavior and [[chemical_reactions | Chemical Reactions]]

The behavior and configuration of electrons play a crucial role in [[chemical_reactions | chemistry]] and [[interaction of atoms and molecules | how atoms interact with each other]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

> "electrons can interact with other electrons. Or they can be taken away by other atoms. And that actually forms a lot of our [[the role of chemistry in understanding reality | understanding of chemistry]]. It's based on how many electrons an atom has, or a certain element has. And how those electrons are configured." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>

Because unlike charges attract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>, electrons are drawn towards the positively charged nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. However, their high velocity prevents them from simply falling into the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

The way electrons are configured around the nucleus determines how an atom will react, bond, attract, or repel other atoms of the same or different [[elements and the periodic table | elements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. For example, an atom can lose an electron if another atom with a stronger affinity for electrons "swipes" it away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. If a carbon atom loses an electron, it will have fewer electrons than protons, resulting in a net positive charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.

Understanding the configuration and movement of electrons is fundamental to predicting and explaining [[chemical_reactions | chemical reactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. The ability of these fundamental particles to be swapped around changes the properties of an atom or even transforms it into an atom of another element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.

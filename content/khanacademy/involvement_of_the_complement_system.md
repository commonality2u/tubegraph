The [[inflammatory_response_symptoms | inflammatory response]] is the body's initial field of battle when faced with an intruder beyond its first line of defense, such as skin or mucous membranes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. During this response, various actors come into play, including the nonspecific complement system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

## Components and Activation
The complement system consists of a set of proteins that circulate in the blood plasma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. Under normal circumstances, these proteins exist in an inactive state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. However, when an [[inflammatory_response_symptoms | inflammatory response]] is triggered, these proteins become activated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. Their activation often involves being cleaved into smaller, active versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.

## Role in Immune Defense
Once activated, the cleaved versions of these proteins play a crucial role in a very nonspecific way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. They help to kill off invading pathogens, such as bacteria, at the site of infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. The complement system, being a set of proteins that are always present and floating around, serves as a significant first line of nonspecific defense against invading pathogens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.

It is important to note that immunology is a highly complex and actively researched field, and the exact mechanisms of the complement system are still not 100% well understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

Despite receiving significant philanthropic support, [[khan_academy_and_its_educational_impact | Khan Academy]] continues to face financial challenges and requires ongoing donations to fulfill its mission of providing free, world-class education for anyone, anywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. The organization operates at a substantial deficit annually and relies on broad community support to maintain and expand its offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## Impact of Donations

Recent generous contributions, such as the [[elon_musk_donation_to_khan_academy | $5 million donation from Elon Musk and the Musk Foundation]], are crucial for accelerating [[khan_academy_and_its_educational_impact | Khan Academy's]] educational initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This funding enables the development of new content across all subjects from K through early college, with a particular focus on science and early learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. It also facilitates improvements to their software and practice exercises, making them more engaging for millions of students and teachers [[online_learning_and_technology_in_education | worldwide]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

[[impact_of_donations_on_khan_academys_programs | Donations]] to [[khan_academy_and_its_educational_impact | Khan Academy]] demonstrate a remarkable return on investment. Efficacy studies indicate a social return to investment ratio of 400 to 500 to 1, significantly surpassing the typical good philanthropic return of five to ten to one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This high ratio reflects the substantial positive impact the platform has on moving the dial in classrooms and fostering [[confidence_in_learning_potential | learning potential]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Ongoing Financial Needs

Despite its extensive [[global_reach_and_goals_of_khan_academy | global reach]], with 120 million registered users and 20-30 million students using the platform monthly, [[khan_academy_and_its_educational_impact | Khan Academy]] operates on a relatively modest budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The world spends an estimated five trillion dollars on education annually, yet [[khan_academy_and_its_educational_impact | Khan Academy's]] budget is only about one one-hundred-thousandth of that, comparable to the budget of a large high school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

In 2021, [[khan_academy_and_its_educational_impact | Khan Academy]] continued to run at a deficit, underscoring the necessity for sustained financial support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Every donation, regardless of size, contributes directly to accelerating learning in various dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

> "There's many billions who need this, there's people throughout the planet who need a way to tap into their potential and I view this type of investment in what we're doing as really foundational for us to be able to build a multi-generational institution so that future [[elon_musk_donation_to_khan_academy | Elon Musks]] of the world are also able to tap into their potential and help all of us up level who we are as a civilization." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>

## Aspirational Goals

[[khan_academy_and_its_educational_impact | Khan Academy's]] aspirations extend to serving the entire globe and becoming a multi-generational institution capable of educating all of humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This ambitious goal requires substantial investment to ensure that individuals worldwide can access the resources to tap into their full potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. The mission is viewed as critically important as other global challenges, such as solving climate change or colonizing other planets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

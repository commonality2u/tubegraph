From: [[khanacademy]] <br/> 

The [[basic_addition_with_visuals | basic addition]] operation demonstrates a key property where the order of numbers being added does not change the sum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. While not explicitly named in this presentation, this concept is known as the commutative property of addition.

## Demonstrating the Property

Consider the [[basic_addition_with_visuals | addition]] problem 5 plus 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>. Using a [[number_line_for_addition | number line]], if you start at 5 and move 6 steps to the right, you land on 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>. Therefore, 5 plus 6 equals 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.

Now, consider the problem 6 plus 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>. If you start at 6 on the [[number_line_for_addition | number line]] and move 5 steps to the right, you also land on 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>. This shows that 5 plus 6 yields the same result as 6 plus 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.

## Real-Life Example

This property can be understood with a simple [[addition_with_real_life_examples | real-life example]] using avocados:
*   If you have 5 avocados and are given 6 more, you will have 11 avocados in total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.
*   Similarly, if you start with 6 avocados and are given 5 more, you will still have 11 avocados <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>.

The outcome remains the same regardless of the order in which the numbers are added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>. This fundamental rule applies consistently across various [[basic_addition_with_visuals | addition problems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.

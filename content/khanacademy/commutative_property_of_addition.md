The commutative property of addition states that changing the order of the numbers being added does not change the sum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>.

## Demonstrating the Property

Consider the [[basic_addition_concepts | addition]] problem 5 plus 6. Using a [[number_line_for_addition | number line]], one can start at 5 and move 6 units to the right, landing on 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. Thus, 5 plus 6 equals 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.

Now, consider the problem 6 plus 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>. If you start at 6 on the [[number_line_for_addition | number line]] and move 5 units to the right, you also land on 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>. This demonstrates that 5 plus 6 is the same as 6 plus 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.

## Real-world Example

This property can also be understood using objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>. If you have 5 avocados and are given 6 more, you will have a total of 11 avocados <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. Similarly, if you start with 6 avocados and are given 5 more, you will still have 11 avocados <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>. The final quantity remains the same regardless of the order in which the avocados were added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>. This principle applies consistently across various [[basic_addition_concepts | addition]] problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.

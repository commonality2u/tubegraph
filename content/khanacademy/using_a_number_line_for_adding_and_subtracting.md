A [[number_line_for_addition | number line]] is a useful tool for visualizing [[adding_and_subtracting_negative_numbers | adding and subtracting negative numbers]]. It helps to understand the direction and magnitude of changes when performing [[negative_number_arithmetic | arithmetic operations]].

## Basic Subtraction: Positive Minus Positive

When [[subtracting negative numbers | subtracting]] a positive number from another positive number, especially if the subtracted number is larger, the result will be a negative number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

### Example: 2 - 3

To calculate 2 - 3 using a number line:
1.  Start at 2 on the number line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
2.  Subtracting 3 means moving 3 units to the left on the number line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
3.  Moving 1, 2, then 3 steps to the left from 2 leads to -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
4.  Therefore, 2 - 3 = -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Subtracting from a Negative Number

The principle of moving to the left for subtraction applies regardless of the starting position on the number line.

### Example: -2 - 3

To calculate -2 - 3:
1.  Start at -2 on the number line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
2.  Subtracting 3 means moving 3 units to the left from -2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
3.  Moving 1, 2, then 3 steps to the left from -2 leads to -5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
4.  Therefore, -2 - 3 = -5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
    *   In both `2 - 3` and `-2 - 3`, subtracting 3 always results in moving 3 units to the left on the number line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. The starting point determines the final position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Adding to a Negative Number

When [[adding negative numbers | adding]] a positive number, you move to the right on the number line.

### Example: -2 + 3

To calculate -2 + 3:
1.  Start at -2 on the number line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
2.  Adding 3 means moving 3 units to the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
3.  Moving 1, 2, then 3 steps to the right from -2 leads to 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
4.  Therefore, -2 + 3 = 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

## Subtracting a Negative Number

[[understanding_subtraction_of_a_negative_as_addition | Subtracting a negative]] number is equivalent to [[adding_negative_numbers | adding]] the positive version of that number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. This rule simplifies calculations involving double negatives.

### Example: 2 - (-3)

To calculate 2 - (-3):
1.  Applying the rule, 2 - (-3) is the same as 2 + 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
2.  2 + 3 = 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

### Example: -2 - (-3)

To calculate -2 - (-3):
1.  Even with multiple negatives, the rule applies: [[subtracting negative numbers | subtracting a negative]] becomes [[adding_negative_numbers | adding a positive]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
2.  So, -2 - (-3) is equivalent to -2 + 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
3.  As shown in the previous example, to calculate -2 + 3, you start at -2 and move 3 units to the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
4.  Moving 1, 2, then 3 steps to the right from -2 leads to 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
5.  Therefore, -2 - (-3) = 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

The immune system is broadly categorized into two main branches: the nonspecific (innate) immune system and the specific (adaptive) immune system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## [[innate_immune_system_and_its_components | Innate Immune System]]

The [[innate_immune_system_and_its_components | innate immune system]] is often referred to as the nonspecific immune system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This means it doesn't differentiate between types of viruses, proteins, or bacteria; it merely recognizes something as "shady" and acts to eliminate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This system is a more ancient adaptation, existing across many species and organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

It comprises two main lines of defense:

1.  **First Line Barriers**
    These are natural physical and chemical barriers that prevent foreign entities from entering the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Examples include:
    *   Skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>
    *   Stomach acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>
    *   The acidity of oils on the skin's surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>

2.  **Second Line of Defense**
    Once pathogens bypass the first line of defense, the body employs a second set of nonspecific responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. These include:
    *   [[cellular_mechanisms_of_inflammation | Inflammatory response]]: This process helps to direct immune components to the site of infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
    *   [[role_of_phagocytes_in_the_immune_response | Phagocytes]]: These are cells that engulf and destroy foreign substances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Examples of [[role_of_phagocytes_in_the_immune_response | phagocytes]] include [[role_of_mast_cells_and_dendritic_cells | dendritic cells]], macrophages, and neutrophils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. All [[role_of_phagocytes_in_the_immune_response | phagocytes]] discussed in the context of the [[innate_immune_system_and_its_components | innate immune system]] are types of white blood cells, also known as leukocytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. The [[innate_immune_system_and_its_components | innate immune system]] detects general indicators of foreignness, such as double-stranded DNA, which is characteristic of viruses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

## Adaptive Immune System

The specific, or adaptive, immune system is considered a newer evolutionary adaptation, particularly complex in humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. It is characterized by its ability to "adapt" and develop resistance to specific pathogens after exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

The primary cellular components of the adaptive immune system are [[functions_of_lymphocytes_b_and_t_cells | lymphocytes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. [[functions_of_lymphocytes_b_and_t_cells | Lymphocytes]] are distinct from other white blood cells (leukocytes) like [[role_of_phagocytes_in_the_immune_response | phagocytes]] in their specific roles, though both are types of white blood cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

[[functions_of_lymphocytes_b_and_t_cells | Lymphocytes]] are divided into two main categories:

1.  **B Lymphocytes (B cells)**
    *   **Development**: B cells are developed in the bone marrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Historically, the "B" comes from the bursa of Fabricius, a part of birds involved in the immune system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
    *   **Function**: B cells participate in the [[humoral_vs_cellmediated_immune_response | humoral response]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. The [[humoral_vs_cellmediated_immune_response | humoral response]] targets pathogens (like viruses or bacteria) while they are still floating freely in the body's fluids (humoral fluids) and have not yet infiltrated cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

2.  **T Lymphocytes (T cells)**
    *   **Development**: T lymphocytes originate in the bone marrow but mature and become functional in the thymus gland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. The "T" comes from "thymus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
    *   **Function**: T lymphocytes participate in the [[humoral_vs_cellmediated_immune_response | cell-mediated response]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. This response is crucial for dealing with cells that have already been infected by viruses or colonized by bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Key types of T cells include helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. Helper T cells can amplify and activate the [[humoral_vs_cellmediated_immune_response | humoral response]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

The specific immune system's effectiveness relies on prior exposure to pathogens, allowing it to "remember" and mount a more targeted and efficient response upon subsequent encounters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

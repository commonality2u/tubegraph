When [[adding_fractions_with_different_denominators | adding fractions with different denominators]], the first step is to ensure they share a [[finding_a_common_denominator | common denominator]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This requires [[finding_a_common_denominator | finding a common denominator]] that both original denominators can divide into <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The most efficient [[finding_a_common_denominator | common denominator]] to use is the [[least_common_multiple | least common multiple]] (LCM) of the denominators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. The [[least_common_multiple | LCM]] is the smallest common multiple of the numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Finding the Least Common Multiple

One method to find the [[least_common_multiple | LCM]] is to list the multiples of the larger denominator and check if any are divisible by the other denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

### Example: Finding the LCM of 9 and 12

To find the [[least_common_multiple | LCM]] of 9 and 12:
1.  List multiples of 9:
    *   9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a> (not divisible by 12)
    *   18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a> (not divisible by 12)
    *   27 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a> (not divisible by 12)
    *   36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a> (is divisible by 12, as 12 * 3 = 36) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>
2.  Since 36 is the first multiple of 9 that 12 also divides into, 36 is the [[least_common_multiple | least common multiple]] of 9 and 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Converting Fractions Using the LCM

Once the [[least_common_multiple | LCM]] is found, each fraction must be rewritten with this new [[finding_a_common_denominator | common denominator]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

### Example: Converting 4/9 and 11/12

Using 36 as the [[finding_a_common_denominator | common denominator]]:
*   **For 4/9:**
    *   To change the denominator from 9 to 36, multiply by 4 (9 * 4 = 36) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
    *   Multiply the numerator by the same factor: 4 * 4 = 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
    *   So, 4/9 is equivalent to 16/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **For 11/12:**
    *   To change the denominator from 12 to 36, multiply by 3 (12 * 3 = 36) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
    *   Multiply the numerator by the same factor: 11 * 3 = 33 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
    *   So, 11/12 is equivalent to 33/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

With both fractions now having the same denominator (36), they can be added directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
> 16/36 + 33/36 = 49/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>

The resulting improper fraction (numerator larger than denominator) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a> can then be converted to a mixed number if required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. For 49/36, 36 goes into 49 once with a remainder of 13, making the mixed number 1 and 13/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

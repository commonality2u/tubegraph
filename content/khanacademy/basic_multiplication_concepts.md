[[multiplication_as_repeated_addition | Multiplication]] is a mathematical operation that can be understood as a simplified way of performing [[multiplication_as_repeated_addition | addition]] repeatedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:45">[01:41:45]</a>. It's often represented by the "times" symbol (x or *).

## Understanding Multiplication

To understand multiplication, consider the example of 2 times 3:
*   **As [[multiplication_as_repeated_addition | repeated addition]] of the first number:** You can think of "2 times 3" as adding the number 2 to itself three times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.
    > 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>
    > This means you have three instances of the number 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.
*   **As [[multiplication_as_repeated_addition | repeated addition]] of the second number:** Alternatively, you can think of "2 times 3" as adding the number 3 to itself two times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
    > 3 + 3 = 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>
    > In this interpretation, the number 2 indicates how many times the number 3 is added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

Regardless of how it's interpreted, 2 times 3 equals 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>. This demonstrates an important [[properties_of_multiplication | property of multiplication]]: the order of the numbers does not change the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>. So, 2 x 3 is the same as 3 x 2.

## [[Using multiplication to simplify counting | Using Multiplication to Simplify Counting]]

Multiplication is useful for [[using_multiplication_to_simplify_counting | simplifying counting]] large groups of items arranged in a structured way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.

Consider an arrangement of lemons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>:
```
🍋 🍋 🍋
🍋 🍋 🍋
🍋 🍋 🍋
🍋 🍋 🍋
```
By direct counting, there are 12 lemons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>.
Using multiplication:
1.  **Count items per row:** There are 3 lemons in each row <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:06]</a>.
2.  **Count the number of rows:** There are 4 rows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>.
3.  **Multiply:** The total number of lemons is 4 times 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>.
    *   4 times 3 can be thought of as "3 added four times": 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>.
    *   Alternatively, 3 times 4 can be thought of as "4 added three times": 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>.

While counting 12 lemons directly is fast, multiplication becomes much more efficient when dealing with larger numbers, like 100 lemons per row and 100 rows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>.

## [[Multiplication with 1 and 0 | Special Cases in Multiplication]]

### [[Multiplication with 1 and 0 | Multiplying by 1]]

When any number is multiplied by 1, the product is the original number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>.
*   **Example:** 3 times 1
    *   This can be interpreted as "one 3" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a> or "three 1s" (1 + 1 + 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>.
    *   In both cases, the result is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>.

[!INFO]
*   3 x 1 = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>
*   1 x 3 = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a>
*   100 x 1 = 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>
*   1 x 39 = 39 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>

### [[Multiplication with 1 and 0 | Multiplying by 0]]

When any number is multiplied by 0, the product is always 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>.
*   **Example:** 4 times 0
    *   This can be interpreted as "zero 4s" (meaning no 4s are present) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:00">[12:31:00]</a>.
    *   Or, it can be interpreted as "0 added four times": 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:00">[12:03:00]</a>.

[!INFO]
*   4 x 0 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a>
*   5,493,692 x 0 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>
*   0 x 17 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:00">[13:07:00]</a>

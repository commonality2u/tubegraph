[[Multiplication properties and concepts | Multiplication]] involves unique rules when working with the numbers one and zero, which can sometimes be counter-intuitive compared to [[multiplication_properties_and_concepts | addition]].

## Multiplying by One

When a number is multiplied by one, the result is always that number itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. This concept can be understood in two ways:

*   **"Three 1's"**: Interpreting "3 times 1" as adding the number 1 to itself three times (1 + 1 + 1) results in 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.
*   **"3 One Time"**: Interpreting "3 times 1" as simply having the number 3 "one time" also results in 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

Regardless of the order, "anything times 1" or "1 times anything" equals "that anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

### Examples
*   3 times 1 = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>
*   100 times 1 = 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>
*   1 times 39 = 39 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>

## Multiplying by Zero

Unlike addition where adding zero to a number leaves the number unchanged (e.g., 3 + 0 = 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>, [[properties_of_zeros_in_equations | multiplication by zero]] always results in zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

This can be understood through two interpretations:

*   **"Zero four times"**: For "4 times 0", this means adding zero to itself four times (0 + 0 + 0 + 0), which equals 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.
*   **"Four zero times"**: This interpretation of "4 times 0" implies not writing the number 4 at all, resulting in nothing, or zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.

### Examples
*   4 times 0 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>
*   5,493,692 times 0 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>
*   0 times 17 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>

Understanding [[basic_multiplication_concepts | multiplication tables]] is a fundamental starting point for performing division, especially with larger numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Mastery of tables from 1x1 up to at least 10x10 (and ideally 12x12) is crucial for efficient computation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

## Division as the Inverse of Multiplication

Division problems can often be rephrased as missing factor [[basic_multiplication_concepts | multiplication]] problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. For example:
*   Dividing 25 by 5 can be thought of as "5 times what equals 25?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
    *   Knowing the 5-multiplication tables, one quickly identifies that 5 × 5 = 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Thus, 25 divided by 5 is 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   Similarly, 49 divided by 7 is equivalent to asking "7 times what equals 49?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
    *   From [[basic_multiplication_concepts | multiplication tables]], 7 × 7 = 49 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   For 54 divided by 9: "9 times what equals 54?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
    *   Even if not instantly memorized, one can reason: 9 × 5 = 45, so 9 × 6 (9 more than 45) is 54 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

This inverse relationship allows for quick computation of basic division problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## Handling Remainders

Not all division problems result in a clean, whole number quotient. [[basic_multiplication_concepts | Multiplication tables]] also help in finding the largest multiple that fits within the number being divided, leaving a remainder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

*   To divide 23 by 3:
    *   List multiples of 3: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
    *   23 is not a multiple of 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
    *   The largest multiple of 3 that is less than or equal to 23 is 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
    *   Since 3 × 7 = 21, 3 goes into 23 seven times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
    *   The remainder is 23 - 21 = 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
    *   So, 23 divided by 3 is 7 remainder 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

## Applying Tables to Multidigit Division

[[using_long_division_with_multidigit_numbers | Long division with multidigit numbers]] relies heavily on breaking down larger numbers into smaller parts that can be solved using known [[basic_multiplication_concepts | multiplication facts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

### Example: 344 ÷ 4

1.  **Consider the leftmost digit:** How many times does 4 go into 3? Zero times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
2.  **Consider the first two digits:** How many times does 4 go into 34? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
    *   Using the 4-multiplication table: 4 × 8 = 32, and 4 × 9 = 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
    *   Since 36 is greater than 34, 4 goes into 34 eight times (with a remainder) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
    *   Write 8 above the tens place (the '4' in '34') <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
    *   Multiply 8 × 4 = 32, and write 32 below 34 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
    *   Subtract: 34 - 32 = 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
3.  **Bring down the next digit:** Bring down the 4 from 344, creating 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
4.  **Repeat the process:** How many times does 4 go into 24? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
    *   Using the 4-multiplication table: 4 × 6 = 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
    *   Write 6 above the ones place (the final '4') <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
    *   Multiply 6 × 4 = 24, and write 24 below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
    *   Subtract: 24 - 24 = 0. There is no remainder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
    *   Thus, 344 divided by 4 is exactly 86 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

This systematic approach, which forms the basis of [[long_division_with_larger_numbers | long division]], heavily relies on the rapid recall of [[basic_multiplication_concepts | multiplication facts]] to determine how many times the divisor goes into each segment of the dividend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

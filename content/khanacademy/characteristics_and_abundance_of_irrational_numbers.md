## Definition
[[examples_and_definition_of_irrational_numbers|Irrational numbers]] are distinct from [[definition_of_rational_numbers|rational numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While a [[definition_of_rational_numbers|rational number]] can be represented as the ratio of two integers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, [[examples_and_definition_of_irrational_numbers|irrational numbers]] cannot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

## Characteristics
A key characteristic of [[examples_and_definition_of_irrational_numbers|irrational numbers]] is their decimal representation:
*   They never terminate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   They never repeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. This differentiates them from [[repeating_decimals_as_rational_numbers|repeating decimals]], which are [[definition_of_rational_numbers|rational numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Examples of Irrational Numbers
Some of the most famous numbers in mathematics are [[examples_and_definition_of_irrational_numbers|irrational numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. These include:
*   **Pi (π)**: The ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **e**: A number that appears in continuously compounding interest and complex analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   **Square root of 2 (√2)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   **Phi (φ)**: The golden ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

Many numbers that "pop out of nature" are [[examples_and_definition_of_irrational_numbers|irrational numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Abundance
Despite seeming exotic, [[examples_and_definition_of_irrational_numbers|irrational numbers]] are not uncommon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   There is always an [[examples_and_definition_of_irrational_numbers|infinite number]] of [[examples_and_definition_of_irrational_numbers|irrational numbers]] between any two [[definition_of_rational_numbers|rational numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   The square root of any non-perfect square will result in an [[examples_and_definition_of_irrational_numbers|irrational number]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
*   The sum of an [[examples_and_definition_of_irrational_numbers|irrational number]] and a [[definition_of_rational_numbers|rational number]] is always [[examples_and_definition_of_irrational_numbers|irrational]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   The product of an [[examples_and_definition_of_irrational_numbers|irrational number]] and a [[definition_of_rational_numbers|rational number]] is also always [[examples_and_definition_of_irrational_numbers|irrational]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

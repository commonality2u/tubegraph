The demand curve is a fundamental concept in microeconomics, serving as a visual representation of the relationship between the price of a product and the quantity demanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. It is derived from a [[demand_schedule_and_demand_curve | demand schedule]], which is a table listing various prices and their corresponding quantities demanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.

## The [[law_of_demand | Law of Demand]]

The foundation of the demand curve is the [[law_of_demand | law of demand]], a core idea in microeconomics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This law states that if the price of a product increases, the quantity demanded for that product will decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. Conversely, if the price of a product decreases, the quantity demanded will increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. While generally true, there are some exceptions to this rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.

## [[demand_schedule_and_demand_curve | Demand Schedule]]: The Foundation

A [[demand_schedule_and_demand_curve | demand schedule]] presents a series of scenarios, illustrating how price relates to quantity demanded, assuming all other factors remain constant (ceteris paribus) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.

For example, consider the potential demand for a new science fiction ebook, "Space Whatever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>:

| Scenario | Price | Quantity Demanded (Units) |
| :------- | :---- | :------------------------ |
| A        | $2    | 60,000                    |
| B        | $4    | 40,000                    |
| C        | $6    | 30,000                    |
| D        | $8    | 25,000                    |
| E        | $10   | 23,000                    |

This table explicitly shows how raising the price leads to a lower quantity demanded, consistent with the [[law_of_demand | law of demand]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

## Graphing the Demand Curve

To create a demand curve, the data from the [[demand_schedule_and_demand_curve | demand schedule]] is plotted on a graph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>.

### Axis Convention

In economics, there is a specific convention for plotting demand curves:
*   **Vertical Axis:** Price is typically placed on the vertical axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. This is a common practice in economics, despite the fact that price is often the variable being changed, which in other fields might lead to it being placed on the horizontal axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.
*   **Horizontal Axis:** Quantity demanded is placed on the horizontal axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>.

### Plotting Points and Drawing the Curve

Once the axes are set up, each scenario from the [[demand_schedule_and_demand_curve | demand schedule]] is plotted as a point. For the "Space Whatever" ebook example:

*   Scenario A: ($60,000 quantity, $2 price) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>
*   Scenario B: ($40,000 quantity, $4 price) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>
*   Scenario C: ($30,000 quantity, $6 price) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>
*   Scenario D: ($25,000 quantity, $8 price) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>
*   Scenario E: ($23,000 quantity, $10 price) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>

After plotting these individual points, a continuous line or curve is drawn connecting them. This curve represents all possible price and quantity demanded combinations, not just the specific points in the table, as prices can vary continuously (e.g., $2.01 or $4.50) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>.

## [[difference_between_demand_and_quantity_demanded | Demand vs. Quantity Demanded]]

It is crucial to understand the [[difference_between_demand_and_quantity_demanded | distinction between "demand" and "quantity demanded"]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>, as this is a common point of confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>:

*   **Quantity Demanded:** Refers to a specific amount of a product that consumers are willing to buy at a *given price*, assuming all other factors are constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>. When only the price changes, you move *along* the existing demand curve, representing a change in the quantity demanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>.

*   **Demand:** Refers to the *entire relationship* between various prices and the corresponding quantities demanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>. This means the entire [[demand_schedule_and_demand_curve | demand schedule]] or the entire demand curve itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>. If factors other than price (e.g., consumer income, tastes, price of substitutes) change, the *entire demand curve* will shift, indicating a change in demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>.

[[introduction_to_negative_numbers|Negative numbers]] are any numbers less than 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. While they might initially appear "deep and mysterious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, they are frequently encountered in everyday life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

### Temperature
When measuring temperature, 0 degrees Celsius is a reference point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. If it's 3 degrees Celsius and the temperature drops 4 degrees, it becomes -1 degree Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This means going one degree below zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

### Bank Accounts
Consider having $10 in a bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. If you spend $30, assuming the bank allows it, your account will show -$20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. A negative balance signifies that you owe the bank money, rather than having money available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

## [[visualizing_negative_numbers_on_a_number_line|Visualizing Negative Numbers on a Number Line]]

The [[number_line_technique_for_addition_and_subtraction|number line]] is a fundamental tool for understanding [[adding_negative_numbers|adding]] and [[subtracting_negative_numbers|subtracting negative numbers]].

*   Numbers increase in positive values as you move to the right of 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   Numbers become negative as you move to the left of 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   For example, -1 is to the left of 0, then -2, then -3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

### Comparing Negative Numbers

A larger negative number represents a *smaller* value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   -3 is less than -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, meaning it's colder or a greater lack of heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   -100 is much smaller than -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. If it's -100 degrees, there's a much greater lack of heat compared to -1 degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## [[number_line_technique_for_addition_and_subtraction|Number Line Technique for Addition and Subtraction]]

When performing operations:
*   **Subtracting** (or "losing" or "getting colder"): Move to the **left** on the number line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. The numbers get smaller, even past 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
*   **Adding** (or "gaining" or "getting warmer"): Move to the **right** on the number line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Examples of Subtraction

**1. [[understanding_subtracting_a_larger_number_from_a_smaller_number|Subtracting a Larger Number from a Smaller Number]]**
To solve 3 - 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>:
*   Start at 3 on the number line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.
*   Subtracting 4 means moving 4 spaces to the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   Moving 1 step left from 3 brings you to 2.
*   Moving 2 steps left from 3 brings you to 1.
*   Moving 3 steps left from 3 brings you to 0.
*   Moving 4 steps left from 3 brings you to -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
    Therefore, 3 - 4 = -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

To solve 2 - 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>:
*   Start at 2 on the number line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.
*   Subtracting 8 means moving 8 spaces to the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
*   Moving 2 steps left from 2 brings you to 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   You still need to move 6 more spaces to the left (8 - 2 = 6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   Moving 6 more steps left from 0 brings you to -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
    Therefore, 2 - 8 = -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

**2. Subtracting from a Negative Number**
To solve -4 - 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>:
*   Start at -4 on the number line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   Subtracting 2 means moving 2 spaces to the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
*   Moving 1 step left from -4 brings you to -5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   Moving 2 steps left from -4 brings you to -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
    Therefore, -4 - 2 = -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

### Examples of Addition

**1. Adding to a Negative Number**
To solve -3 + 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>:
*   Start at -3 on the number line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   Adding 2 means moving 2 spaces to the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
*   Moving 1 step right from -3 brings you to -2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   Moving 2 steps right from -3 brings you to -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
    Therefore, -3 + 2 = -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

### Key Takeaway
When first learning to [[solving_linear_equations_involving_negative_numbers|deal with negative numbers]], it is highly recommended to visualize the [[number_line_technique_for_addition_and_subtraction|number line]] and mentally or physically move along it to understand the operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

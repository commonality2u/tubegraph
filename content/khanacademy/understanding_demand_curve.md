In economics, the demand curve is a graphical representation used to visualize the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity consumers are willing and able to purchase at various price points within a specific market, such as the [[apple_market_supply_and_demand | apple market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Graphing the Demand Curve
To [[graphing_the_demand_curve | graph a demand curve]], a standard setup is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>:
*   The vertical axis represents the price, often expressed as "price per pound" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
*   The horizontal axis represents the quantity, such as "quantity of apples" in thousands of pounds for a given period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

For instance, prices might range from $1 to $5 per pound, and quantities from 1000 to 5000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Relationship Between Price and Quantity Demanded
The [[law_of_demand | law of demand]] suggests an inverse relationship between price and the quantity demanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>:
*   **High Prices**: If the price of apples is very high, consumers will [[impact_of_price_changes_on_quantity_demanded | demand less]], leading to a low quantity demanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. For example, at $5 a pound, the quantity demanded might be around 500 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   **Low Prices**: If the price is low, consumers will [[impact_of_price_changes_on_quantity_demanded | demand more]]. At $1 a pound, the quantity demanded might be 4000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

This inverse relationship typically results in a downward-sloping demand curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Demand vs. Quantity Demanded
It's important to understand the [[difference_between_demand_and_quantity_demanded | distinction between "demand" and "quantity demanded"]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>:
*   **Quantity Demanded**: Refers to the specific amount of a good consumers are willing to buy at a particular price point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. For example, "the quantity demanded is 500 apples" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Demand**: Represents the entire relationship between various prices and the quantities demanded at those prices, forming the complete [[demand_schedule_and_demand_curve | demand curve]] or schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Market Dynamics and the Demand Curve
The demand curve interacts with the [[understanding_supply_curve | supply curve]] to determine market outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>:

*   **Shortage**: If the initial price is set too low (e.g., $1 per pound), the quantity supplied (1000 pounds) will be significantly less than the quantity demanded (4000 pounds), creating a shortage of 3000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. In such a scenario, consumers will bid up prices, causing prices to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. As prices rise, the quantity demanded will decrease, moving along the demand curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

*   **Surplus**: Conversely, if the price is set too high (e.g., $3 per pound), the quantity supplied (3000 pounds) will exceed the quantity demanded (1300 pounds), resulting in a surplus of 1700 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Producers will then reduce prices to sell their inventory, causing prices to fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. As prices decrease, the quantity demanded will increase, moving along the demand curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

These market forces naturally push the price and quantity towards a point where the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

## Equilibrium Price and Quantity
The point where the demand curve and supply curve intersect is known as the **equilibrium point** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
*   **Equilibrium Price**: This is the price at which the quantity supplied is exactly equal to the quantity demanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. In the apple market example, this might be around $2.15 per pound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
*   **Equilibrium Quantity**: This is the quantity at which demand and supply are balanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. In the example, it's about 2200 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

At the equilibrium price and quantity, both consumers and producers are satisfied, and all goods produced are sold without shortages or surpluses, assuming no other changes occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

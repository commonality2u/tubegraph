The [[slope_of_a_line_in_algebra | slope]] of a line indicates its steepness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. A fundamental property of [[slope_of_a_line_in_algebra | slope]] in [[linear_equations | linear equations]] is that it remains constant for any given straight line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Calculating Slope

[[Understanding slope of a straight line | Slope]] is defined as the "change in y over change in x" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This can also be expressed using the capital Greek letter Delta (Δ) to represent "change in," so [[finding the slope of a line | slope]] = Δy / Δx <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

To [[Determining slope | determine the slope]] of a line from a graph, any two points on the line can be chosen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. It's often easiest to select points with integer coordinates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

### Calculation Example 1

Consider two points on a line:
1.  **Starting Point:** (-3, -3)
2.  **Ending Point:** (0, -1)

To find the change in x (Δx):
*   Count steps horizontally from -3 to 0. This is 3 steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   Δx = 0 - (-3) = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

To find the change in y (Δy):
*   Count steps vertically from -3 to -1. This is 2 steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   Δy = -1 - (-3) = 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

Therefore, the [[slope_of_a_line_in_algebra | slope]] is Δy / Δx = 2 / 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

### Calculation Example 2 (Demonstrating Consistency)

To illustrate that the [[slope_of_a_line_in_algebra | slope]] is constant regardless of the chosen points, consider different points and direction:
1.  **Starting Point:** (3, 1)
2.  **Ending Point:** (-3, -3)

To find the change in y (Δy):
*   Moving from y=1 down to y=-3. This is a change of -4 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   Δy = -3 - 1 = -4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

To find the change in x (Δx):
*   Moving from x=3 to the left to x=-3. This is a change of -6 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   Δx = -3 - 3 = -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

Therefore, the [[slope_of_a_line_in_algebra | slope]] is Δy / Δx = -4 / -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
When simplified, the negatives cancel out, resulting in 4/6, which further simplifies to 2/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

This demonstrates that "no matter which point you choose, as long as you kind of think about it in a consistent way, you're going to get the same value for [[slope_of_a_line_in_algebra | slope]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

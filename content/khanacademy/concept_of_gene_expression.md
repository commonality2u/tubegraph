DNA's structure as a double helix makes it suitable as the molecular basis of heredity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. To fulfill this role, the genetic material must be replicable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, ensuring that as a cell divides, new cells receive the same genetic information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Beyond replication, this information must be used to define and express the characteristics of an organism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

## DNA Replication

The process of DNA replication involves splitting the two sides of the DNA ladder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Each separated strand then serves as a template to construct a new complementary strand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. For example, adenine (A) always pairs with thymine (T), and guanine (G) always pairs with cytosine (C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. By following these pairing rules, two identical DNA strands are created from one original strand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. This replication occurs before a cell divides and duplicates itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

## Gene Expression

Gene expression describes how the information encoded in DNA is utilized to define an organism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. This process involves several key molecules and steps.

### DNA, Chromosome, and Gene Defined

It's important to distinguish between DNA, chromosomes, and genes:
*   **DNA** is the molecule itself, characterized by its sugar-phosphate backbone and sequence of base pairs in a double helix structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   A **chromosome** is a DNA molecule packaged with other molecules and proteins to form a broader structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   A **gene** is a specific section of DNA that codes for a certain type of protein, thereby expressing a particular trait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Genes can range from several thousand to millions of base pairs long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

### [[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | Role of RNA in Gene Expression]]

The expression of a gene's information into a protein occurs through a related molecule called RNA (ribonucleic acid) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. In cells with nuclei, DNA remains in the nucleus, but its information must be transferred outside to be expressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. RNA, specifically messenger RNA (mRNA), acts as the messenger, carrying genetic information from the DNA in the nucleus to the cytoplasm where proteins are synthesized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

### Transcription: From DNA to mRNA

The first step in gene expression is **transcription**, where the DNA's information is copied into an mRNA molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. This process is conceptually similar to DNA replication, where a single strand of DNA serves as a template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. However, in RNA:
*   Adenine (A) pairs with uracil (U) instead of thymine (T) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   Thymine (T) still pairs with adenine (A) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
*   Guanine (G) still pairs with cytosine (C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

After transcription, the newly formed single strand of mRNA detaches and carries the genetic information from that section of DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

### [[translation_of_rna_to_proteins | Translation of RNA to Proteins]]

The mRNA then leaves the nucleus and attaches to a ribosome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. This is where **translation** occurs, converting the base pair sequence of mRNA into an amino acid sequence, which forms a protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

*   **Codons**: Each sequence of three bases on the mRNA is called a codon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. There are 64 possible codons (4 bases x 4 bases x 4 bases) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>, which is more than enough to code for the 20 possible amino acids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. Some amino acids are coded for by more than one codon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.
*   **Amino Acids and tRNA**: Each codon codes for a specific amino acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. Amino acids are brought to the ribosome and matched to their corresponding codons on the mRNA by another type of RNA called transfer RNA (tRNA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.
*   **Protein Construction**: As amino acids are linked together in a specific sequence, a protein is constructed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. These proteins, which can be thousands of amino acids long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>, are the molecules that perform most functions in living organisms, acting as enzymes, structural components (like muscle), and more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. They form complex shapes and carry out the "work of life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

One of the core ideas of microeconomics is the [[law_of_demand | law of demand]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This principle states that if the price of a product increases, the [[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] for that product will decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Conversely, if the price of a product decreases, the [[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] will increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. While generally true, there are some exceptions to this [[law_of_demand | law of demand]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Demand vs. Quantity Demanded

It is crucial to distinguish between "[[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | demand]]" and "[[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]]" in economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **[[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | Quantity demanded]]** refers to a specific quantity of a product that consumers are willing to buy at a given price, assuming all other factors remain constant (ceteris paribus) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
*   **[[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | Demand]]** refers to the entire relationship between price and [[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]], with all else being equal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

When only the price of a product changes, it results in a change in the [[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]], not a change in [[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | demand]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. A change in [[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | demand]] itself implies a shift in the entire relationship (i.e., a different demand curve or schedule), which is caused by factors other than price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

## Representing Demand

The relationship between price and [[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] can be illustrated in two primary ways:

### Demand Schedule
A [[demand_schedule_and_demand_curve | demand schedule]] is a table that displays the relationship between various prices and the corresponding [[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | quantities demanded]], assuming all other factors are constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

For example, consider a hypothetical science fiction ebook titled "Space Whatever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>:

| Scenario | Price ($) | Quantity Demanded (Units) |
| :------- | :-------- | :------------------------ |
| A        | 2         | 60,000                    |
| B        | 4         | 40,000                    |
| C        | 6         | 30,000                    |
| D        | 8         | 25,000                    |
| E        | 10        | 23,000                    |

This table explicitly demonstrates the [[law_of_demand | law of demand]]; as the price increases, the [[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

### Demand Curve
A [[graphing_demand_curves | demand curve]] is a graphical representation of the [[demand_schedule_and_demand_curve | demand schedule]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. It plots the points from the schedule and connects them to show a continuous relationship between price and [[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]], as prices can vary continuously (e.g., $2.01 or $4.50) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

By convention in economics, price is plotted on the vertical (y) axis, and [[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] is plotted on the horizontal (x) axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

Each point on the [[graphing_demand_curves | demand curve]] represents a specific [[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] at a particular price (e.g., Scenario A: Price $2, Quantity 60,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. The entire curve itself represents the [[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | demand]] for the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. When only price changes, there is a movement *along* the [[graphing_demand_curves | demand curve]], indicating a change in [[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. If other factors were to change, the entire curve would shift, representing a change in [[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | demand]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

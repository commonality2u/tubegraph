Humans have observed for thousands of years that different substances exist in the environment, each possessing distinct [[properties_of_substances_and_elements | properties]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. These [[properties_of_substances_and_elements | properties]] can include how they reflect light, their color, or their state (liquid, gas, or solid) at a given temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Substances also [[interaction_and_behavior_of_atoms | react]] with each other under specific circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Examples of substances include carbon (in graphite form), lead, and gold, all of which can exist in solid, liquid, or gaseous states depending on temperature or other [[interaction_and_behavior_of_atoms | reactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Defining Elements

The fundamental question arises: if a substance like carbon is continuously broken down into smaller chunks, is there a smallest unit that still retains the [[properties_of_substances_and_elements | properties]] of carbon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>? The answer is yes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

These pure substances with specific [[properties_of_substances_and_elements | properties]] and [[interaction_and_behavior_of_atoms | reaction]] behaviors are called [[basic_concepts_of_elements_and_atoms | elements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. Carbon, lead, and gold are all [[basic_concepts_of_elements_and_atoms | elements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. Historically, water was considered an element, but it is now known to be composed of more [[basic_concepts_of_elements_and_atoms | basic elements]]: oxygen and hydrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

All known [[basic_concepts_of_elements_and_atoms | elements]] are systematically listed in the [[periodic_table_of_elements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. For example, 'C' stands for carbon, 'O' for oxygen, 'N' for nitrogen, 'Si' for silicon, 'Au' for gold, and 'Pb' for lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

## The Atom: The Basic Unit of an Element

The most [[basic_building_blocks_of_matter | basic unit]] of any [[basic_concepts_of_elements_and_atoms | element]] is the [[basic_concepts_of_elements_and_atoms | atom]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>. If one were to continuously break down a substance like carbon, they would eventually reach a carbon [[basic_concepts_of_elements_and_atoms | atom]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. This [[basic_concepts_of_elements_and_atoms | atom]] cannot be broken down further while still retaining the [[properties_of_substances_and_elements | properties]] of its original [[basic_concepts_of_elements_and_atoms | element]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

[[basic_concepts_of_elements_and_atoms | Atoms]] are unimaginably small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. For context, if you took a human hair, which is primarily made of carbon, approximately one million carbon [[basic_concepts_of_elements_and_atoms | atoms]] could be strung across its width <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.

## Subatomic Particles: Protons, Neutrons, and Electrons

What is even more remarkable is that these [[basic_building_blocks_of_matter | basic building blocks]] (atoms) are themselves composed of even more fundamental [[atomic_structure_and_subatomic_particles | particles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>. The arrangement and number of these fundamental [[atomic_structure_and_subatomic_particles | particles]] define the [[basic_concepts_of_elements_and_atoms | element]] and its [[properties_of_substances_and_elements | properties]], including how it [[interaction_and_behavior_of_atoms | reacts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. Changing the number of these [[atomic_structure_and_subatomic_particles | particles]] can alter the [[properties_of_substances_and_elements | properties]] of an [[basic_concepts_of_elements_and_atoms | element]] or even change it into a different [[basic_concepts_of_elements_and_atoms | element]] entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>.

The three main [[atomic_structure_and_subatomic_particles | subatomic particles]] are:
*   **Protons**: These are located at the center of the [[basic_concepts_of_elements_and_atoms | atom]], in its nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>. The number of protons uniquely defines an [[basic_concepts_of_elements_and_atoms | element]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>. This is known as the [[atomic_structure_and_subatomic_particles | atomic number]], which is listed at the top for each [[basic_concepts_of_elements_and_atoms | element]] in the [[periodic_table_of_elements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>. For example, hydrogen has one proton, helium has two, and carbon has six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>. Changing the number of protons changes the [[basic_concepts_of_elements_and_atoms | element]] itself (e.g., carbon with seven protons becomes nitrogen) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>. Protons carry a positive charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>.

*   **Neutrons**: Also found in the nucleus, neutrons are neutral, meaning they have no charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>. The number of neutrons can vary within atoms of the same [[basic_concepts_of_elements_and_atoms | element]] (e.g., Carbon-12 has six neutrons, while Carbon-14 has eight, both still being carbon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>. The sum of protons and neutrons in the nucleus is often reflected in the element's mass number (e.g., '12' in Carbon-12) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>.

*   **Electrons**: These [[atomic_structure_and_subatomic_particles | particles]] "buzz around" the nucleus, often conceptualized as orbiting it, though their [[interaction_and_behavior_of_atoms | behavior]] is more complex and explained by quantum physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>. Electrons carry a negative charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>. Unlike charges attract, which is why electrons are bound to the positively charged nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>. In a neutral [[basic_concepts_of_elements_and_atoms | atom]], the number of electrons typically equals the number of protons, balancing the charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>.

## Atomic Interactions and Chemistry

The [[interaction_and_behavior_of_atoms | interactions]] between electrons, particularly their configuration and how they are gained or lost, form a significant part of understanding [[understanding_chemical_equations_and_reactions | chemistry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:12:00]</a>. An [[basic_concepts_of_elements_and_atoms | atom]] can gain or lose electrons; if a neutral carbon [[basic_concepts_of_elements_and_atoms | atom]] (six protons, six electrons) loses an electron, it would have five electrons and six protons, resulting in a net positive charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:14:00">[12:14:00]</a>. This concept is fundamental to predicting how atoms of the same or different [[basic_concepts_of_elements_and_atoms | elements]] will [[interaction_and_behavior_of_atoms | react]], bond, or repel each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>.

This article provides practice in [[adding_and_subtracting_negative_numbers | adding and subtracting negative numbers]], focusing on how to approach subtraction problems involving [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negative numbers]]. A [[understanding_negative_numbers_on_a_number_line | number line]] is used as a visual aid to demonstrate the operations.

## Basic Subtraction on a Number Line

When subtracting a positive number, you move to the left on the [[understanding_negative_numbers_on_a_number_line | number line]].

### Example 1: Subtracting a Larger Positive Number

To calculate 2 minus 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>:
*   Start at 2 on the [[understanding_negative_numbers_on_a_number_line | number line]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   Subtracting 3 means moving 3 units to the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   Moving 1 unit left from 2 reaches 1, 2 units reaches 0, and 3 units reaches -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   Therefore, 2 - 3 = -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

### Example 2: Subtracting a Positive Number from a Negative Number

To calculate -2 minus 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>:
*   Start at -2 on the [[understanding_negative_numbers_on_a_number_line | number line]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   Subtracting 3 means moving 3 units to the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   Moving 1 unit left from -2 reaches -3, 2 units reaches -4, and 3 units reaches -5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   Therefore, -2 - 3 = -5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

### Example 3: Adding a Positive Number to a Negative Number

To calculate -2 plus 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>:
*   Start at -2 on the [[understanding_negative_numbers_on_a_number_line | number line]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   Adding 3 means moving 3 units to the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   Moving 1 unit right from -2 reaches -1, 2 units reaches 0, and 3 units reaches 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   Therefore, -2 + 3 = 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Subtracting a Negative Number

A key rule in [[negative_number_arithmetic | negative number arithmetic]] is that [[understanding_subtraction_of_a_negative_as_addition | subtracting a negative]] number is equivalent to [[adding_negative_numbers | adding its positive counterpart]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

### Example 4: Positive Number Minus Negative Number

To calculate 2 minus negative 3 (2 - (-3)) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>:
*   This expression is the same as [[adding_negative_numbers | adding the positive]] number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   So, 2 - (-3) is equivalent to 2 + 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   Therefore, 2 - (-3) = 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

### Example 5: Negative Number Minus Negative Number

To calculate -2 minus negative 3 (-2 - (-3)) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>:
*   Remember that [[understanding_subtraction_of_a_negative_as_addition | subtracting a negative]] results in a positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   So, -2 - (-3) is the same as -2 + 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   As shown in Example 3, starting at -2 and [[adding_negative_numbers | adding]] 3 (moving 3 units to the right on the [[understanding_negative_numbers_on_a_number_line | number line]]) leads to 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   Therefore, -2 - (-3) = 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

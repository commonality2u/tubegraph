To effectively divide larger numbers, a foundational understanding of multiplication tables is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. It is recommended to know your multiplication tables from 1x1 up to at least 10x10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, or even 12x12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Basic Division Using Multiplication Tables

Division can be thought of as the inverse operation of multiplication.

For example:
*   **25 divided by 5:** Think "5 times what equals 25?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
    *   Since 5 times 5 is 25, the answer is 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The result should be written in the ones place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   **49 divided by 7:** Think "7 times what equals 49?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
    *   Since 7 times 7 is 49, the answer is 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **54 divided by 9:** Think "9 times what equals 54?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
    *   If you don't have it memorized, you can use known facts, such as 9 times 5 equals 45, and then add 9 more to get 54, indicating that 9 times 6 is 54 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Thus, 9 goes into 54 six times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## [[handling_remainders_in_division_problems | Handling Remainders in Division Problems]]

Not all division problems result in a whole number. When a number doesn't divide cleanly, there will be a remainder.

*   **Example: 23 divided by 3** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>
    1.  List multiples of 3: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
    2.  Notice that 23 is not a multiple of 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
    3.  Find the largest multiple of 3 that is less than or equal to 23. This is 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
    4.  Since 3 times 7 is 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, 3 goes into 23 seven times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
    5.  To find the remainder, subtract the multiple found (21) from the original number (23): 23 - 21 = 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
    6.  The result is 7 with a remainder of 2, written as 7 remainder 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## [[basic_steps_in_long_division | Basic Steps in Long Division]] for Larger Numbers

For larger numbers, a systematic approach known as long division is used. This method breaks down the division into smaller, manageable steps, relying on your knowledge of multiplication tables and place value.

### Example 1: 344 divided by 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>

1.  **Check the first digit:** How many times does 4 go into 3? It goes in 0 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. (This 3 is in the hundreds place, so it's 300, and 4 goes into 300 zero hundred times).
2.  **Consider the first two digits:** How many times does 4 go into 34? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>
    *   Recall your 4-multiplication tables: 4 times 8 equals 32, and 4 times 9 equals 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
    *   Since 36 is greater than 34, 4 goes into 34 eight times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
    *   Write the '8' above the '4' in the tens place of the dividend (344) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
3.  **Multiply and Subtract:**
    *   Multiply the quotient digit (8) by the divisor (4): 8 times 4 equals 32 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
    *   Write 32 below 34 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
    *   Subtract: 34 minus 32 equals 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. (This 2 represents 20, as it's in the tens column) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
4.  **Bring down the next digit:** Bring down the '4' from the ones place of 344 next to the 2, forming 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
5.  **Repeat the process:** How many times does 4 go into 24? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>
    *   Since 4 times 6 equals 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>, 4 goes into 24 six times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
    *   Write the '6' above the '4' in the ones place of the dividend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
6.  **Multiply and Subtract again:**
    *   Multiply the new quotient digit (6) by the divisor (4): 6 times 4 equals 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
    *   Write 24 below 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
    *   Subtract: 24 minus 24 equals 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
    *   Since there's no remainder, the division is exact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

Therefore, 344 divided by 4 is exactly 86 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

### Example 2: 91 divided by 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>

1.  **Check the first digit:** How many times does 7 go into 9? One time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
2.  **Multiply and Subtract:**
    *   Write '1' above the '9' in the tens place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
    *   1 times 7 is 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
    *   9 minus 7 is 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
3.  **Bring down the next digit:** Bring down the '1' from the ones place, making it 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
4.  **Repeat the process:** How many times does 7 go into 21? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>
    *   Since 7 times 3 is 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>, 7 goes into 21 three times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
    *   Write '3' above the '1' in the ones place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
5.  **Multiply and Subtract again:**
    *   3 times 7 is 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
    *   21 minus 21 is 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

Therefore, 91 divided by 7 is 13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

### Example 3: 608 divided by 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>

1.  **Check the first digit:** How many times does 8 go into 6? Zero times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
2.  **Consider the first two digits:** How many times does 8 go into 60? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>
    *   Recall your 8-multiplication tables: 8 times 7 is 56, and 8 times 8 is 64 <a class="yt-timestamp" data="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
    *   Since 64 is greater than 60, 8 goes into 60 seven times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
    *   Write '7' above the '0' in the tens place of the dividend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
3.  **Multiply and Subtract:**
    *   7 times 8 is 56 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
    *   60 minus 56 is 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
4.  **Bring down the next digit:** Bring down the '8' from the ones place, making it 48 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
5.  **Repeat the process:** How many times does 8 go into 48? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>
    *   Since 8 times 6 is exactly 48 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>, 8 goes into 48 six times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.
    *   Write '6' above the '8' in the ones place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
6.  **Multiply and Subtract again:**
    *   6 times 8 is 48 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
    *   48 minus 48 is 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

Thus, 608 divided by 8 is 76 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

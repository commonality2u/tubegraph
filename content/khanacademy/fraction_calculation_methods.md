When performing operations with fractions, there are specific methods to follow for multiplication and simplification.

## Multiplying Fractions

[[Multiplying fractions | Multiplying fractions]] is a straightforward process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. To find the product of two fractions, multiply their numerators together to get the new numerator, and multiply their denominators together to get the new denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

For example, to multiply 5/6 by 2/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>:
*   The new numerator is 5 times 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   The new denominator is 6 times 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

This results in:
`5/6 * 2/3 = (5 * 2) / (6 * 3) = 10/18` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Simplifying Fractions (Reduction)

After [[multiplying fractions | multiplying fractions]], the resulting fraction should often be simplified to its lowest terms. This involves finding common factors between the numerator and the denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

Using the example of 10/18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>:
1.  Both 10 and 18 are divisible by 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
2.  Divide the numerator (10) by 2: `10 / 2 = 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
3.  Divide the denominator (18) by 2: `18 / 2 = 9` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

The simplified fraction is 5/9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This is an example of [[fraction_reduction_techniques | fraction reduction techniques]].

## Simplifying Before Multiplication

A more efficient method for [[multiplying fractions | multiplying fractions]] involves [[fraction_reduction_techniques | simplifying fractions]] *before* performing the multiplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This can make the numbers smaller and easier to work with.

Consider 5/6 times 2/3 again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>:
1.  Look for common factors between any numerator and any denominator. In this case, 2 (numerator of the second fraction) and 6 (denominator of the first fraction) share a common factor of 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
2.  Divide the numerator 2 by 2, which becomes 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
3.  Divide the denominator 6 by 2, which becomes 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

The expression now becomes:
`5/3 * 1/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

Now, perform the multiplication:
` (5 * 1) / (3 * 3) = 5/9` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

This method achieves the same result as multiplying first and then simplifying, but often makes the intermediate calculations simpler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

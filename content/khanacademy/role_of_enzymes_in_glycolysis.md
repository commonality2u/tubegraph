[[Glycolysis_process | Glycolysis]] is a crucial biochemical pathway that occurs in practically all life forms, focusing on the breakdown of glucose into two pyruvate molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This complex process, happening continuously within cells, is facilitated by various specialized enzymes that lower activation energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

## General Function of Enzymes

Enzymes play a vital role in biochemical reactions by lowering the activation energy required for the reactions to proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. In [[glycolysis]], these enzymes guide the transformation of glucose through a series of steps.

## Enzymes in the Investment Phase

The initial stages of [[glycolysis]] involve an [[ATP_production_and_consumption_in_glycolysis | investment phase]] where ATP is consumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

*   **Hexokinase**
    *   Facilitates the phosphorylation of glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
    *   A kinase is a general term for an enzyme that facilitates either phosphorylation or dephosphorylation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
    *   This step consumes one ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, marking the first ATP investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
    *   It is aided by a magnesium ion (Mg²⁺) as a co-factor, which helps lower the activation energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

*   **Phosphoglucose Isomerase**
    *   Facilitates the conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
    *   Isomerases are enzymes that help convert one isomer of a molecule to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
    *   This reaction can go both ways, but generally proceeds forward due to the downstream consumption of products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

*   **Phosphofructokinase**
    *   Facilitates the attachment of another phosphate group to fructose-6-phosphate, forming fructose-1,6-bisphosphate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
    *   This step also consumes one ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, making it the second ATP investment in the [[investment_and_payoff_phases_of_glycolysis | investment phase]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
    *   It also uses a magnesium co-factor to stabilize negative charges from the phosphate groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

*   **Fructose Bisphosphate Aldolase**
    *   Breaks down the 6-carbon fructose bisphosphate into two 3-carbon chains: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and another molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
    *   Aldolase enzymes facilitate the aldol reaction, which can either merge or break molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

*   **Triose Phosphate Isomerase**
    *   Converts the other 3-carbon molecule (dihydroxyacetone phosphate) into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
    *   This ensures that both 3-carbon products can proceed through the subsequent steps of [[glycolysis_process | glycolysis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

## Enzymes in the Payoff Phase

Following the cleavage of the glucose molecule, the [[glycolysis_process | payoff phase]] begins, where ATP and NADH are generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

*   **Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate Dehydrogenase**
    *   Facilitates the [[reduction_of_nad_to_nadh_in_glycolysis | reduction of NAD to NADH]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
    *   Dehydrogenases are typically involved in such reduction reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.
    *   In this process, an additional phosphate group is added to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. The NADH produced can be used later in the electron transport chain to produce more ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

*   **Phosphoglycerate Kinase**
    *   Removes one of the phosphate groups from the molecule, producing ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
    *   Since the process is now happening twice (from the two 3-carbon molecules), this step generates two ATP molecules (2 x +1 ATP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

*   **Phosphoglycerate Mutase**
    *   A mutase is a class of isomerases that move a functional group from one place to another within a molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
    *   This enzyme relocates the phosphate group from one carbon to a different carbon within the molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

*   **Enolase**
    *   Facilitates the next step in the pathway, leading towards the final product of [[glycolysis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

*   **Pyruvate Kinase**
    *   Dephosphorylates the molecule, yielding the final product of [[glycolysis]], pyruvate (or pyruvic acid) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.
    *   This step produces another two ATP molecules (2 x +1 ATP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

In summary, the enzymes involved in [[glycolysis]] ensure the efficient conversion of glucose into pyruvate, with a net production of two ATP and two NADH molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The NADH can then be used to generate further ATP via the electron transport chain if oxygen is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

Logarithms are a fundamental mathematical concept used to determine the power to which a base number must be raised to obtain another number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. They provide an alternative way of thinking about exponential relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.

## Understanding Logarithms

To understand logarithms, it's helpful to first recall exponents. For example, `2` to the fourth power (`2^4`) means `2` multiplied by itself four times (`2 * 2 * 2 * 2`), which equals `16` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

A logarithm reverses this process. Instead of calculating the result of an exponent, a logarithm asks: "To what power must a given base be raised to get a certain number?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>. For instance, if you start with `2` and want to reach `16` by raising `2` to some power, the logarithm helps you find that power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>. In this case, `x` would be `4` since `2^4 = 16` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.

## Logarithm Notation

The standard notation for a logarithm uses "log" followed by a base as a subscript, and then the number being evaluated.

For the example above (`2^x = 16`), the [[introduction_to_logarithms | logarithm notation]] would be:
`log base 2 of 16 = x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

Here:
*   `log` denotes the logarithmic operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.
*   `2` is the *base* of the logarithm, written as a subscript <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>.
*   `16` is the *argument* or *number* for which the logarithm is being calculated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.
*   `x` is the *exponent* or *power* that the base must be raised to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.

## [[relationship_between_exponents_and_logarithms | Relationship between Exponents and Logarithms]]

The exponential statement `b^x = y` and the logarithmic statement `log base b of y = x` are completely equivalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. This highlights the [[inverse_relationship_between_logarithms_and_exponents | inverse relationship between logarithms and exponents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.

For instance:
*   The statement "`2` to some `x` power equals `16`" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>
*   Is equivalent to the statement "`what power do I need to raise 2 to, to get 16?`" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>

Both expressions yield `x = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

*   **`log base 3 of 81`** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>
    *   This asks: "What power must `3` be raised to, to get `81`?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>
    *   We can write this as `3^x = 81` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
    *   `3^1 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>
    *   `3^2 = 9` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>
    *   `3^3 = 27` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>
    *   `3^4 = 81` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>
    *   Therefore, `log base 3 of 81 = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.

*   **`log base 6 of 216`** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>
    *   This asks: "What power must `6` be raised to, to get `216`?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>
    *   `6^1 = 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>
    *   `6^2 = 36` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>
    *   `6^3 = 216` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>
    *   Therefore, `log base 6 of 216 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.

*   **`log base 2 of 64`** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>
    *   This asks: "What power must `2` be raised to, to get `64`?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>
    *   `2^1 = 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>, `2^2 = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>, `2^3 = 8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>, `2^4 = 16` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>, `2^5 = 32` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>, `2^6 = 64` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>.
    *   Therefore, `log base 2 of 64 = 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>.

### Special Case: Logarithm of 1

*   **`log base 100 of 1`** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>
    *   This asks: "What power must `100` be raised to, to get `1`?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>
    *   If we set this equal to `x`, it's `100^x = 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>.
    *   Any non-zero number raised to the power of `0` is equal to `1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>.
    *   Therefore, `x = 0`, and `log base 100 of 1 = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.
    *   This leads to the general property: `Log base b of 1 = 0` for any valid base `b` (where `b` is not 0) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>.

This article provides an [[introduction_to_statistics | introduction to statistics]] by explaining how to find the mean, median, and mode of a set of numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These are different ways of measuring the "central tendency" or "middle" of a data set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

The data set used for examples is: 23, 29, 20, 32, 23, 21, 33, 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. There are 8 numbers in this set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Mean

The mean is commonly referred to as the average in everyday language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. It is also sometimes called the arithmetic mean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

To calculate the mean:
1.  Sum all the numbers in the set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
2.  Divide the sum by the total count of numbers in the set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

### Example Calculation
For the given set of numbers (23, 29, 20, 32, 23, 21, 33, 25):
*   **Sum of numbers**: 23 + 29 + 20 + 32 + 23 + 21 + 33 + 25 = 206 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>
*   **Number of values**: 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>
*   **Mean**: 206 / 8 = 25.75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>

## Median

The median is the middle number in a data set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

To find the median:
1.  Order the numbers from least to greatest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
2.  If the number of values is odd, the median is the single middle number.
3.  If the number of values is even (as in this example), there will be two middle numbers. The median is the average (mean) of these two middle numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. The median does not necessarily have to be one of the numbers in the original data set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

### Example Calculation
For the given set of numbers (23, 29, 20, 32, 23, 21, 33, 25):
1.  **Order the numbers**: 20, 21, 23, 23, 25, 29, 32, 33 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>
2.  **Identify middle numbers**: Since there are 8 numbers (an even count), the two middle numbers are the 4th and 5th values: 23 and 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
3.  **Calculate the median**: (23 + 25) / 2 = 48 / 2 = 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>
*   **Median**: 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>

## Mode

The mode is the number that appears most frequently in a data set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

### Example Calculation
For the given set of numbers (23, 29, 20, 32, 23, 21, 33, 25):
*   All numbers appear once, except for 23, which appears twice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Mode**: 23 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>

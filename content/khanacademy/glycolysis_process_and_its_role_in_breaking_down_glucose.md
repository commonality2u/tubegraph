From: [[khanacademy]] <br/> 

[[glycolysis_process_and_phases | Glycolysis]] is the initial step in [[cellular_respiration_process | cellular respiration]], where a [[role_of_glucose_in_energy_production | glucose]] molecule is broken down to produce energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The term "glycolysis" literally means "splitting glucose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Process Overview

[[glycolysis_process_and_phases | Glycolysis]] begins with a single 6-carbon [[role_of_glucose_in_energy_production | glucose]] molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This molecule is split in half, resulting in two 3-carbon molecules called pyruvic acid, or pyruvate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This entire process is catalyzed by [[enzymes_involved_in_glycolysis | enzymes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

## Location in the Cell

[[glycolysis_process_and_phases | Glycolysis]] occurs in the **cytoplasm** of the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. The cytoplasm is the fluidic space between the organelles within the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## Oxygen Requirement

[[glycolysis_process_and_phases | Glycolysis]] does not require oxygen to proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. It can occur in the presence or absence of oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Energy Yield

The net energy payoff from [[glycolysis_process_and_phases | glycolysis]] is:
*   **Two net ATPs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. While the process generates four [[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | ATPs]], it uses two [[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | ATPs]] in an initial investment stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   **Two NADHs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. These [[role_of_nad_in_glycolysis | NADH]] molecules carry electrons that will be used later in the electron transport chain to produce a significant amount of [[atp_production_in_glycolysis | ATP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

## Connection to Further Cellular Respiration

The pyruvate molecules produced during [[glycolysis_process_and_phases | glycolysis]] are then prepared to enter the Krebs cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle), which takes place in the mitochondria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. The [[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | ATP]] and [[role_of_nad_in_glycolysis | NADH]] molecules generated by [[glycolysis_process_and_phases | glycolysis]] (along with FADH2 from the Krebs cycle) are crucial inputs for the electron transport chain, where the bulk of [[atp_production_in_glycolysis | ATP]] is produced during [[cellular_respiration_process | cellular respiration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

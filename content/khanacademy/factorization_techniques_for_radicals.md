## What is a Radical?
In mathematics, a radical is most commonly referred to as the square root symbol (√) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The process of [[simplifying_radicals | simplifying radicals]] involves rewriting an expression under a radical sign to its simplest form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Connection to Exponent Rules
The concept of simplifying radicals is an extension of [[exponents_and_radical_notation | exponent rules]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. A square root is equivalent to raising a number to the 1/2 power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

Consider the square root of a product, such as √`a * b`. According to exponent rules, `(a * b)^(1/2)` is the same as `a^(1/2) * b^(1/2)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This means that √`a * b` is equal to √`a` * √`b` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This fundamental rule is key to factorization techniques for radicals.

## Simplification Technique
The primary goal in simplifying a radical is to extract any factors that are perfect squares from underneath the radical sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

### Steps for Factorization
1.  **Identify Perfect Square Factors**: Look for the largest factor of the number under the radical that is a perfect square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Common perfect squares include:
    *   1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>
    *   4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>
    *   9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>
    *   16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>
    *   25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>
    *   36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>
    *   49 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>
    *   64 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>
    *   and so on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
2.  **Factor the Radical**: Rewrite the number under the radical as a product of its largest perfect square factor and another number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
    *   Example: √72 can be factored as √(36 * 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
3.  **Separate the Radicals**: Apply the rule √`a * b` = √`a` * √`b` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
    *   Example: √(36 * 2) becomes √36 * √2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
4.  **Simplify the Perfect Square**: Calculate the square root of the perfect square factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
    *   Example: √36 * √2 becomes 6 * √2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
5.  **Check for Further Simplification**: Ensure that the remaining number under the radical has no other perfect square factors (other than 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

### Example Walkthroughs

*   **Simplifying √50**:
    *   Identify the largest perfect square factor of 50, which is 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
    *   Rewrite as √(25 * 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
    *   Separate: √25 * √2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
    *   Simplify: 5√2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

*   **Simplifying 7√27**:
    *   Identify the largest perfect square factor of 27, which is 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
    *   Rewrite as 7 * √(9 * 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
    *   Separate: 7 * √9 * √3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
    *   Simplify: 7 * 3 * √3 = 21√3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

### Iterative Simplification for Larger Numbers
For larger numbers, it might not be immediately obvious what the largest perfect square factor is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. In such cases, you can perform the simplification in steps by taking out smaller perfect square factors until no more are left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

*   **Simplifying 7√320**:
    *   Initial observation: 320 is divisible by 16 (since 16 goes into 32) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
    *   Step 1: 7 * √(16 * 20) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a> = 7 * √16 * √20 = 7 * 4 * √20 = 28√20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
    *   Step 2: The remaining number, 20, is still divisible by a perfect square (4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
    *   Simplify further: 28 * √(4 * 5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a> = 28 * √4 * √5 = 28 * 2 * √5 = 56√5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
    *   The process continues until the number under the radical can no longer be reduced by factoring out perfect squares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

### When Simplification Is Not Possible
If a number under the radical is a prime number or has no perfect square factors other than 1, it cannot be simplified further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **Example**: 3√29 cannot be simplified because 29 is a prime number with only factors 1 and 29 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, and neither are perfect squares (other than 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

Interpreting mathematical statements, particularly through the use of the [[performing_legitimate_algebraic_operations | order of operations]], is fundamental to all subsequent work in mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The primary purpose of an agreed-upon order of operations is to ensure that there is only one way to interpret any given mathematical statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## The Problem of Ambiguity

Without a universal agreement on how to interpret mathematical statements, a single expression could yield multiple different results, leading to chaos and errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. For example, consider the statement: `7 + 3 × 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

Without a defined order, two interpretations are possible:
1.  **Left-to-right interpretation:**
    *   First, add 7 and 3: `7 + 3 = 10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
    *   Then, multiply the result by 5: `10 × 5 = 50` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
2.  **Multiplication-first interpretation:**
    *   First, multiply 3 and 5: `3 × 5 = 15` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
    *   Then, add 7 to the result: `7 + 15 = 22` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

This ambiguity is "completely unacceptable" in mathematics, as it can lead to critical failures in real-world applications, such as space missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. To prevent such discrepancies, a standardized order of operations is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## The Agreed-Upon Order of Operations

The widely accepted order of operations dictates the priority of different [[performing_legitimate_algebraic_operations | operations]] in a mathematical expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>:

1.  **Parentheses (P)**: Operations inside parentheses are performed first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
2.  **Exponents (E)**: Next, operations involving exponents are resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. (Note: Exponents were not present in the examples provided in this video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.)
3.  **Multiplication (M) and Division (D)**: These operations have the same level of priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
4.  **Addition (A) and Subtraction (S)**: These operations also have the same level of priority, performed last <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### Applying the Order of Operations

Following this hierarchy ensures a consistent interpretation and a single correct answer for any given statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

**Example 1: `7 + 3 × 5`**

Using the order of operations:
*   There are no parentheses or exponents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **Multiplication** comes before addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
    *   `3 × 5 = 15` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>
*   Then, **Addition**:
    *   `7 + 15 = 22` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>

Therefore, 22 is the correct interpretation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

**Example 2: `(7 + 3) × 4 ÷ 2 - 5 × 6`**

1.  **Parentheses**: Evaluate `(7 + 3)` first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
    *   `(7 + 3) = 10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>
    *   The expression becomes: `10 × 4 ÷ 2 - 5 × 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
2.  **Exponents**: There are no exponents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
3.  **Multiplication and Division (left to right)**: When multiple operations are at the same level of priority, perform them from left to right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
    *   Perform `10 × 4` first: `10 × 4 = 40` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
    *   The expression becomes: `40 ÷ 2 - 5 × 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
    *   Next, `40 ÷ 2`: `40 ÷ 2 = 20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
    *   Simultaneously, or next, perform `5 × 6`: `5 × 6 = 30` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. (These multiplication/division operations take priority over the subtraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.)
    *   The expression is now: `20 - 30` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
4.  **Addition and Subtraction (left to right)**:
    *   `20 - 30 = -10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

The correct interpretation of the statement is -10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

### Left-to-Right Rule for Same-Level Operations

When an expression contains only addition and subtraction, or only multiplication and division, operations are performed from left to right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

*   **Example (Addition/Subtraction):** `1 + 2 - 3 + 4 - 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>
    *   `1 + 2 = 3`
    *   `3 - 3 = 0`
    *   `0 + 4 = 4`
    *   `4 - 1 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>

*   **Example (Multiplication/Division):** `4 × 2 ÷ 3 × 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>
    *   `4 × 2 = 8`
    *   `8 ÷ 3 = 8/3`
    *   `8/3 × 2 = 16/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>

### Special Cases: All Addition or All Multiplication

If an expression contains *only* addition operations, or *only* multiplication operations, the order in which they are performed does not affect the result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. This means you can calculate them in any order (left-to-right, right-to-left, or picking any pair) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. However, this flexibility only applies when *all* operations are of the same type (all addition or all multiplication); if any division or subtraction is present, adhering to the left-to-right rule is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

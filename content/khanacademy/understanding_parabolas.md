This article explores the domain and range of a given function, focusing on how the properties of [[graphing_quadratic_functions | quadratic functions]] and their parabolic shape help determine the range. The function under consideration is `f(x) = 3x² + 6x - 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Domain of the Function

The domain of a function is defined as the set of all valid inputs, or `x` values, for which the function is defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. For the function `f(x) = 3x² + 6x - 2`, any real number can be squared, multiplied by 3, have 6 times that number added to it, and then 2 subtracted from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Therefore, the function `f(x)` is defined for all real numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

The domain is **all real numbers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

> [!INFO] Real Numbers
> Most traditional numbers, excluding [[complex_numbers_introduction | imaginary numbers]] and [[complex_numbers_introduction | complex numbers]], are part of the set of real numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Range of the Function

The range of a function is the set of all possible outputs, or `y` values (where `y = f(x)`), that the function can produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. To understand the range of `f(x) = 3x² + 6x - 2`, it's helpful to [[graphing_quadratic_functions | graph the function]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### Quadratic Functions and Parabolas

The function `f(x) = 3x² + 6x - 2` is a [[understanding_quadratic_expressions | quadratic function]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. All [[graphing_quadratic_functions | quadratic functions]] have a characteristic parabolic shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

For a parabola, its shape can either be upward-opening or downward-opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This orientation determines the range of values it can take on:
*   An upward-opening parabola will not take on any values below its [[vertex_of_a_quadratic_function | vertex]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   A downward-opening parabola will not take on any values above its [[vertex_of_a_quadratic_function | vertex]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

For `f(x) = 3x² + 6x - 2`, since the coefficient of the `x²` term (3) is positive, it is an upward-opening parabola <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This means its [[vertex_of_a_quadratic_function | vertex]] will represent the minimum point, or the lowest `y` value, that the function can reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

### Identifying the Vertex

The `x`-coordinate of the [[vertex_of_a_quadratic_function | vertex]] for a [[understanding_quadratic_expressions | quadratic function]] in the form `ax² + bx + c` can be found using the formula `x = -b / (2a)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This formula is derived directly from the [[quadratic_formula_introduction | quadratic formula]] by [[completing_the_square | completing the square]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

For `f(x) = 3x² + 6x - 2`:
*   `a = 3`
*   `b = 6`
*   `c = -2`

The `x`-coordinate of the [[vertex_of_a_quadratic_function | vertex]] is `x = -6 / (2 * 3) = -6 / 6 = -1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

To find the `y`-coordinate of the [[vertex_of_a_quadratic_function | vertex]], substitute `x = -1` into the function:
`f(-1) = 3(-1)² + 6(-1) - 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>
`f(-1) = 3(1) - 6 - 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>
`f(-1) = 3 - 6 - 2 = -3 - 2 = -5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>

The [[vertex_of_a_quadratic_function | vertex]] of the parabola is at `(-1, -5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

### Plotting Points and Observing Symmetry

To further illustrate the shape of the parabola, consider these points:
*   When `x = -2`, `f(x) = 3(-2)² + 6(-2) - 2 = 3(4) - 12 - 2 = 12 - 12 - 2 = -2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Point: `(-2, -2)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   When `x = 0`, `f(x) = 3(0)² + 6(0) - 2 = -2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Point: `(0, -2)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   When `x = 1`, `f(x) = 3(1)² + 6(1) - 2 = 3 + 6 - 2 = 7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Point: `(1, 7)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

Notice the symmetry around the [[vertex_of_a_quadratic_function | vertex]]'s `x`-value of `-1`:
*   `f(-2) = -2` (one unit left of `x=-1`)
*   `f(0) = -2` (one unit right of `x=-1`)
This symmetry confirms `(-1, -5)` as the [[vertex_of_a_quadratic_function | vertex]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

The graph of `f(x)` is an upward-opening parabola with its lowest point (the [[vertex_of_a_quadratic_function | vertex]]) at `y = -5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. As `x` moves away from the [[vertex_of_a_quadratic_function | vertex]] (either to the right or left), the `y` values increase indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

### Determining the Range

Since the parabola opens upwards and its minimum point is at `y = -5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>, the function `f(x)` will never output a value less than -5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. It can, however, take on any value greater than or equal to -5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

The range is **all real numbers greater than or equal to -5** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>, or `y >= -5`.

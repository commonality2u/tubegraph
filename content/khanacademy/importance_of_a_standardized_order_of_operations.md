The [[order_of_operations_introduction | order of operations]] is a fundamental concept in mathematics, providing a single, agreed-upon method for interpreting mathematical statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Having a solid understanding of the [[order_of_operations_introduction | order of operations]] is crucial as nearly all subsequent mathematical concepts are based on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## The Problem of Ambiguity

Without a universal agreement on the [[order_of_operations_introduction | order of operations]], a single mathematical statement could be interpreted in multiple ways, leading to different results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

Consider the expression `7 + 3 * 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>:

*   **Left-to-Right Evaluation**: If read straight from left to right, one might perform the addition first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
    *   `7 + 3 = 10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>
    *   `10 * 5 = 50` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>
    This approach simply processes the [[arithmetic_operations | operations]] as they appear sequentially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

*   **Prioritizing Multiplication**: Another interpretation might prioritize multiplication before addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
    *   `3 * 5 = 15` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>
    *   `7 + 15 = 22` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>

As demonstrated, the same statement `7 + 3 * 5` yields two different answers (50 and 22) depending on the interpretation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Consequences of Ambiguity

Such ambiguity is "completely unacceptable" in mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. In real-world applications, especially in fields like engineering or space exploration, misinterpreting a mathematical statement could lead to catastrophic errors, such as a satellite being sent to the wrong planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This necessity for a single, consistent outcome for any given [[understanding_mathematical_equations | mathematical statement]] underscores the critical importance of a standardized [[order_of_operations_introduction | order of operations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

## The Agreed-Upon Order of Operations

To ensure consistent interpretation, a universal [[order_of_operations_introduction | order of operations]] has been established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. When followed, this order guarantees that everyone arrives at the same answer for a given statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

The hierarchy of [[arithmetic_operations | operations]] is as follows:

1.  **Parentheses (or Brackets)**: Operations inside parentheses are performed first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
2.  **Exponents**: Powers and roots are evaluated next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. (Note: This video does not cover exponents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>).
3.  **Multiplication and Division**: These operations have the same level of priority and are performed from left to right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
4.  **Addition and Subtraction**: These operations also have the same level of priority and are performed from left to right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

### Applying the Rule: Re-evaluating the Example

Using the agreed-upon [[order_of_operations_introduction | order of operations]], the correct interpretation of `7 + 3 * 5` is determined as follows:

1.  **Multiplication first**: The [[order_of_operations_introduction | order of operations]] dictates that multiplication takes priority over addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
    *   `3 * 5 = 15` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>
2.  **Addition next**: After multiplication, perform the addition.
    *   `7 + 15 = 22` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>

Therefore, `22` is the correct answer according to the standardized [[order_of_operations_introduction | order of operations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

## Strategies for Complex Expressions

For more complex expressions, follow the hierarchy systematically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>:

*   **Example:** `7 + 3 * 4 / 2 - 5 * 6` (with parentheses `(7 + 3)`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>

1.  **Parentheses**: Evaluate `(7 + 3)` first, which equals `10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
    *   The expression becomes `10 * 4 / 2 - 5 * 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
2.  **Multiplication and Division (left to right)**: Perform these [[arithmetic_operations | operations]] in order from left to right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
    *   `10 * 4 = 40` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
    *   The expression becomes `40 / 2 - 5 * 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
    *   `40 / 2 = 20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
    *   Concurrently, `5 * 6 = 30` (as it does not interfere with the previous operations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
    *   The expression becomes `20 - 30` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
3.  **Addition and Subtraction (left to right)**: Perform these [[arithmetic_operations | operations]] in order from left to right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
    *   `20 - 30 = -10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

### Exceptions to Left-to-Right Evaluation

While the left-to-right rule applies for operations at the same level (multiplication/division, or addition/subtraction) when mixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>, it can be relaxed in specific cases:

*   If an expression consists *only* of addition, the order of operations does not matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. For example, `1 + 5 + 7 + 3 + 2` can be added in any sequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
*   Similarly, if an expression consists *only* of multiplication, the order of operations does not matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. For example, `1 * 5 * 7 * 3 * 2` can be multiplied in any sequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

However, if division or subtraction is present in a sequence of otherwise same-level operations, it is always best to proceed left to right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

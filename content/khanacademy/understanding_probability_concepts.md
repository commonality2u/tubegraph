[[introduction_to_probability | Probability]] is a way of measuring the likelihood that something is going to happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. It quantifies how many desired outcomes meet specific conditions compared to the total number of possible outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Key Probability Terms

Understanding [[calculating_probability | probability]] involves several fundamental terms:

*   **Trial**
    A trial is the action being performed, such as picking a marble out of a bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Event**
    The event is the specific outcome or set of outcomes you are interested in measuring the likelihood of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. For example, picking a yellow marble is an event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   **Outcome**
    An outcome is any single possible result of a trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   **Sample Space**
    The sample space is the set of all possible outcomes from a trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. It represents every single result that could occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The size of the sample space is the total number of possible outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Calculating Probability

To [[calculating_probability | calculate the probability]] of an event, you divide the number of outcomes that satisfy the event by the total number of possible outcomes in the sample space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

> [!Formula] Probability
> $$P(\text{Event}) = \frac{\text{Number of outcomes that satisfy the event}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes (size of sample space)}}$$

### Example: Picking a Yellow Marble

Consider a bag containing marbles:
*   3 yellow marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>
*   2 red marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   2 green marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>
*   1 blue marble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>

We want to find the [[calculating_probabilities_for_specific_outcomes | probability]] of pulling a yellow marble from this bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

1.  **Identify the Event:** The event is "picking a yellow marble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
    *   Number of outcomes that satisfy the event (yellow marbles): There are 3 yellow marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

2.  **Determine the Sample Space:** The total number of possible outcomes (marbles) in the bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
    *   3 (yellow) + 2 (red) + 2 (green) + 1 (blue) = 8 total marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
    *   So, the total number of possible outcomes is 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

3.  **[[calculating_probability | Calculate the Probability]]:**
    $$P(\text{Yellow Marble}) = \frac{\text{Number of yellow marbles}}{\text{Total number of marbles}}$$
    $$P(\text{Yellow Marble}) = \frac{3}{8}$$

Therefore, the [[calculating_probabilities_for_specific_outcomes | probability]] of picking a yellow marble is 3/8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

[[introduction_to_basic_trigonometry | Trigonometry]] is the study of the ratios of sides of triangles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The term "trig" in [[introduction_to_trigonometry | trigonometry]] means "triangle," and "metry" means "measure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Understanding Right Triangles

A right triangle is a triangle where one of its angles measures 90 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This 90-degree angle is also called a right angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

In a right triangle, the longest side is called the hypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. The hypotenuse is always the side opposite the right angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. For example, a right triangle with sides 3, 4, and 5 units has a hypotenuse of 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. These side lengths satisfy the Pythagorean theorem (3² + 4² = 5²) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Core Trigonometric Functions

The primary [[Trigonometric Functions and Right Triangles | trigonometric functions]] are [[Trigonometric functions sine cosine and tangent | sine]], [[Trigonometric functions sine cosine and tangent | cosine]], and [[Trigonometric functions sine cosine and tangent | tangent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. These are often abbreviated as SIN, COS, and TAN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. These functions define the ratios of specific sides for any given angle within a right triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

### The [[soh_cah_toa_mnemonic | SOH CAH TOA]] Mnemonic

To remember the definitions of these functions, a helpful [[mnemonic_for_trigonometric_identities__soh_cah_toa | mnemonic]] is [[soh_cah_toa_mnemonic | SOH CAH TOA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>:

### Identifying Sides Relative to an Angle

When calculating trigonometric ratios, the terms "opposite" and "adjacent" depend on which angle you are focusing on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. The hypotenuse remains the same regardless of the angle chosen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

*   **Opposite**: The side directly across from the angle in question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   **Adjacent**: The side next to the angle in question that is *not* the hypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

## Calculating Trigonometric Ratios: Examples

Let's use a right triangle with sides 3, 4, and a hypotenuse of 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Example 1: Angle Theta (θ)

Consider angle theta (θ) located between the side of length 4 and the hypotenuse of length 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

[[calculation_of_sine_cosine_and_tangent | Calculating]] for angle θ:
*   The side opposite θ is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   The side adjacent to θ is 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
*   The hypotenuse is 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

Using [[soh_cah_toa_mnemonic | SOH CAH TOA]] for [[finding_sine_cosine_and_tangent | finding sine, cosine, and tangent]] of θ:
*   **Sine (θ)** = Opposite / Hypotenuse = 3 / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>
*   **Cosine (θ)** = Adjacent / Hypotenuse = 4 / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>
*   **Tangent (θ)** = Opposite / Adjacent = 3 / 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>

> [!note] Ratio Consistency
> The ratio of opposite to hypotenuse for a given angle will always be the same, regardless of the triangle's size, as long as the angle is identical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

### Example 2: Angle X

Now, let's consider the other non-right angle in the same triangle, labeled as x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

[[calculation_of_sine_cosine_and_tangent | Calculating]] for angle x:
*   The side opposite x is 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   The side adjacent to x is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   The hypotenuse is 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

Using [[soh_cah_toa_mnemonic | SOH CAH TOA]] for [[finding_sine_cosine_and_tangent | finding sine, cosine, and tangent]] of x:
*   **Sine (x)** = Opposite / Hypotenuse = 4 / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>
*   **Cosine (x)** = Adjacent / Hypotenuse = 3 / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>
*   **Tangent (x)** = Opposite / Adjacent = 4 / 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>

This demonstrates how the opposite and adjacent sides change depending on which angle is being referenced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. While the [[soh_cah_toa_mnemonic | SOH CAH TOA]] definition is highly useful for angles between 0 and 90 degrees, more advanced definitions are introduced for angles beyond this range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

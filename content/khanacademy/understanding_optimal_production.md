Optimal production, in an economic context, refers to the most efficient way to use available resources to produce goods or services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This concept is visualized using a [[production_possibilities_frontier | production possibilities frontier]] (PPF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

## The Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF)

The [[production_possibilities_frontier | production possibilities frontier]] is a curve that illustrates all the possible combinations of two goods that can be produced when resources are used efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. It highlights the [[tradeoffs_in_resource_allocation | tradeoffs in resource allocation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

### Constructing the PPF: A Hunter-Gatherer Example

Consider a hunter-gatherer who must decide how much time to spend hunting rabbits and how much to spend gathering berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. To simplify, it's assumed only rabbits can be hunted and only berries can be gathered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

Various scenarios represent different allocations of time and the resulting output:

| Scenario | Rabbits (Avg. per day) | Berries (Avg. per day) |
| :------- | :--------------------- | :--------------------- |
| A        | 5                      | 0                      |
| B        | 4                      | 100                    |
| C        | 3                      | 180                    |
| D        | 2                      | 240                    |
| E        | 1                      | 280                    |
| F        | 0                      | 300                    |
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>

When these scenarios are plotted on a graph with rabbits on one axis and berries on the other, connecting them forms the [[production_possibilities_frontier | production possibilities frontier]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. This curve shows the maximum possible combinations achievable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

### The Importance of [[ceteris_paribus_in_economics | Ceteris Paribus]]

When examining these scenarios and constructing the PPF, a crucial economic assumption is made: [[ceteris_paribus_in_economics | ceteris paribus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This Latin term literally means "all other things equal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

In the hunter-gatherer example, [[ceteris_paribus_in_economics | ceteris paribus]] means that factors like the amount of time available, sleep, hunting/gathering techniques, geography, and tools remain constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. The only variable changing is the allocation of time between hunting rabbits and gathering berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This assumption allows for isolation and study of the relationship between the two primary variables.

## Efficient, Inefficient, and Impossible Production

The [[production_possibilities_frontier | production possibilities frontier]] helps distinguish between different states of production:

### Efficient Production

Points *on* the [[production_possibilities_frontier | frontier]] (like scenarios A through F) represent [[efficient_versus_inefficient_resource_use | efficient production]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. At these points, resources (time, in this example) are being used to their fullest potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. The producer is doing the most they can do with their available resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

### Inefficient Production

Any point *inside* or *below* the [[production_possibilities_frontier | curve]] indicates [[efficient_versus_inefficient_resource_use | inefficient production]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. These combinations of goods are possible, but they are not optimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. This implies that resources are not being utilized optimally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>, meaning more of one or both goods could be produced without more resources. For example, getting 1 rabbit and 200 berries is possible but inefficient, as more berries or rabbits could be obtained by better utilizing time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

### Impossible Production

Any point *outside* or *beyond* the [[production_possibilities_frontier | curve]] represents an impossible scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. With the current resources and technology, these combinations of goods cannot be achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. For instance, simultaneously obtaining 5 rabbits and 200 berries is impossible, as the time spent on one would preclude the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

Optimal production, therefore, lies on the [[production_possibilities_frontier | production possibilities frontier]], where all resources are fully and [[efficient_versus_inefficient_resource_use | efficiently utilized]], demonstrating the [[tradeoffs_in_resource_allocation | tradeoffs]] inherent in resource allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

The [[least_common_multiple | least common multiple]] (LCM) of two or more numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of each of those numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. It is often denoted as LCM(number1, number2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Examples and Methods for Calculation

### Example 1: LCM of 36 and 12

To find the [[least_common_multiple | least common multiple]] of 36 and 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>:
*   36 is a multiple of 12 (12 x 3 = 36) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
*   36 is also a multiple of 36 (36 x 1 = 36) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   Therefore, the smallest number that is a multiple of both 36 and 12 is 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
    *   LCM(36, 12) = 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### Example 2: LCM of 18 and 12

To find the [[least_common_multiple | least common multiple]] of 18 and 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, two common methods can be used:

#### [[prime_factorization_method_for_finding_least_common_multiple | Prime Factorization Method]]

This approach involves breaking down each number into its [[prime_factorization_method_for_finding_least_common_multiple | prime factors]] and then constructing the smallest number that includes all factors from both numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

1.  **Prime factorization of 18:**
    *   18 = 2 x 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>
    *   9 = 3 x 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>
    *   So, 18 = 2 x 3 x 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>

2.  **Prime factorization of 12:**
    *   12 = 2 x 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>
    *   6 = 2 x 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>
    *   So, 12 = 2 x 2 x 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>

3.  **Constructing the LCM:**
    *   The [[least_common_multiple | least common multiple]] must contain enough [[prime_factorization_method_for_finding_least_common_multiple | prime factors]] to cover both numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
    *   To be divisible by 18, it needs 2 x 3 x 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
    *   To also be divisible by 12 (2 x 2 x 3), it needs two 2s and one 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
        *   We already have one 3 from the 18 factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
        *   We already have one 2 from the 18 factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
        *   We need one additional 2 to satisfy the two 2s required for 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
    *   So, the LCM = 2 x 3 x 3 (for 18) x 2 (additional 2 for 12) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
    *   LCM(18, 12) = 2 x 2 x 3 x 3 = 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

#### [[brute_force_method_for_finding_least_common_multiple | Brute Force Method]]

This method involves listing out the multiples of each number until a common multiple is found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

1.  **Multiples of 18:**
    *   18, 36, 54, ... <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>

2.  **Multiples of 12:**
    *   12, 24, 36, ... <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>

3.  The smallest common multiple found in both lists is 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
    *   LCM(18, 12) = 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

## [[comparison_of_methods_for_calculating_least_common_multiple | Comparison of Methods]]

While the [[brute_force_method_for_finding_least_common_multiple | brute force method]] can be quicker for small numbers, the [[prime_factorization_method_for_finding_least_common_multiple | prime factorization method]] is generally preferred for larger or more complex numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. The [[prime_factorization_method_for_finding_least_common_multiple | prime factorization method]] provides a more systematic approach and avoids having to list many multiples before finding the [[least_common_multiple | least common multiple]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

Ratios are expressions used to compare quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Expressing Ratios

Ratios can be expressed in several ways:
*   Using a colon (e.g., 10:5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>
*   As a fraction (e.g., 10/5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>
*   Written out with "to" (e.g., 10 to 5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>

All these forms convey the same comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### Order in Ratios
The order of quantities in a ratio is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. If asked for the ratio of horses to dogs, the number of horses comes first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Conversely, if asked for the ratio of dogs to horses, the number of dogs comes first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

For example, if there are 10 horses and 5 dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>:
*   The ratio of horses to dogs is 10:5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   The ratio of dogs to horses is 5:10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

### [[reducing_ratios | Reducing Ratios]]
Ratios can often be simplified or [[reducing_ratios | reduced]] to their simplest form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This is done by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the quantities and dividing both numbers by it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

Using the horses and dogs example (10 horses, 5 dogs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>:
*   The ratio of horses to dogs is 10:5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   The GCD of 10 and 5 is 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   Dividing both numbers by 5 results in a [[reducing_ratios | reduced]] ratio of 2:1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   This means there are 2 horses for every 1 dog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

While a ratio like 5:10 is not incorrect, the general convention is to express it in its simplest or [[reducing_ratios | reduced]] form (e.g., 1:2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

## [[ratios_with_multiple_quantities | Ratios with Multiple Quantities]]

Ratios can also compare more than two quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

For instance, if you have 20 apples, 40 oranges, and 60 strawberries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>:
*   The ratio of apples to oranges to strawberries is 20:40:60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   To [[reducing_ratios | reduce]] this ratio, find the largest number that divides into all three quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   The largest number that divides into 20, 40, and 60 is 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   Dividing each quantity by 20 yields the [[reducing_ratios | reduced]] ratio of 1:2:3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   This indicates that for every 1 apple, there are 2 oranges and 3 strawberries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

The order of quantities in the ratio still corresponds directly to the order in which they are presented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. So, the ratio of strawberries to oranges to apples would be 3:2:1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

## [[using_ratios_to_solve_problems | Using Ratios to Solve Problems]]

Ratios can be used to determine the exact number of quantities when the total number of items and the ratio are known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

### Example: Boys and Girls in a Classroom
If the ratio of boys to girls in a classroom is 2:3, and there are 40 students in total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>:
1.  **Find the total parts in the ratio**: Add the parts of the ratio: 2 (boys) + 3 (girls) = 5 parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. This means for every 5 students, there are 2 boys and 3 girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
2.  **Determine the number of "groups"**: Divide the total number of students by the total ratio parts: 40 students / 5 students per group = 8 groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
3.  **Calculate the number of specific items**: Multiply the number of groups by the ratio part for the desired item.
    *   For girls: 8 groups * 3 girls per group = 24 girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
    *   For boys: 8 groups * 2 boys per group = 16 boys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

### Example: Farm Animals with Multiple Ratios
If the ratio of sheep to chickens to pigs is 2:5:10, and there are 51 animals in total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>:
1.  **Find the total parts in the ratio**: 2 (sheep) + 5 (chickens) + 10 (pigs) = 17 parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. This means for every 17 animals, there are 2 sheep, 5 chickens, and 10 pigs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.
2.  **Determine the number of "groups"**: Divide the total number of animals by the total ratio parts: 51 animals / 17 animals per group = 3 groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.
3.  **Calculate the number of chickens**: Multiply the number of groups by the chickens' ratio part: 3 groups * 5 chickens per group = 15 chickens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

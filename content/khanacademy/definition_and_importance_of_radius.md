The circle is considered the most fundamental shape in our universe, appearing in phenomena from planetary orbits to wheels and molecular structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Understanding its [[Properties of a Circle | properties]] is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Defining the Radius

A circle is defined as all points that are equidistant from a central point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Every point along the edge of a circle is an equal distance from its center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This consistent distance from the center to any point on the circle's edge is called the **radius** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. For example, if one radius is 3 centimeters, every radius in that circle will be 3 centimeters; it will never change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Radius and Diameter

One key [[Properties of a Circle | property]] of a circle is its [[Definition and Importance of Diameter | diameter]], which is the measurement across its widest point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This widest point always passes through the center of the circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The [[Definition and Importance of Diameter | diameter]] is essentially composed of two radii <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, extending from one side of the circle, through the center, to the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

The relationship between the [[Definition and Importance of Diameter | diameter]] (D) and the radius (r) is straightforward:
$$
D = 2r
$$
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>

Conversely, the radius is half of the [[Definition and Importance of Diameter | diameter]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

## Radius and Circumference

The [[Understanding Circumference | circumference]] is the distance around the circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, similar to the perimeter of other shapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Historically, mathematicians discovered a consistent ratio between a circle's [[Understanding Circumference | circumference]] and its [[Definition and Importance of Diameter | diameter]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. This ratio, initially observed as approximately 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>, was refined with better measurements to a number that constantly extends without repeating: 3.14159... <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

This unique and fundamental number was named [[Introduction to Pi and its Significance | pi]] (Ï€) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
The ratio of the [[Understanding Circumference | circumference]] (C) to the [[Definition and Importance of Diameter | diameter]] (D) is equal to [[Introduction to Pi and its Significance | pi]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>:
$$
\frac{C}{D} = \pi
$$
Since $D = 2r$, we can express the [[Understanding Circumference | circumference]] in terms of the radius:
$$
C = \pi D
$$
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>
Substituting $D = 2r$:
$$
C = \pi (2r)
$$
$$
C = 2\pi r
$$

## Applying the Radius in Calculations

[[Introduction to Pi and its Significance | Pi]] is simply a number, approximately 3.14159 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. In calculations, results are often left in terms of [[Introduction to Pi and its Significance | pi]] for simplicity and precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

### Example 1: Given Radius, Find Circumference and Diameter

If a circle has a radius of 3 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>:
*   **Circumference**:
    *   $C = 2\pi r$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>
    *   $C = 2 \times \pi \times 3 \text{ meters}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>
    *   $C = 6\pi \text{ meters}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>
*   **Diameter**:
    *   $D = 2r$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>
    *   $D = 2 \times 3 \text{ meters}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>
    *   $D = 6 \text{ meters}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>

### Example 2: Given Circumference, Find Diameter and Radius

If a circle has a [[Understanding Circumference | circumference]] of 10 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>:
*   **Diameter**:
    *   We know $\pi \times D = C$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>
    *   $\pi \times D = 10 \text{ meters}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>
    *   $D = \frac{10}{\pi} \text{ meters}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>
*   **Radius**:
    *   $r = \frac{1}{2}D$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>
    *   $r = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{10}{\pi} \text{ meters}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>
    *   $r = \frac{5}{\pi} \text{ meters}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>

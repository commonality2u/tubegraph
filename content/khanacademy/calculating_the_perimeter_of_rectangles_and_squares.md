Perimeter is a fundamental concept in geometry, representing the total distance around the outside of a two-dimensional shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. It can be thought of as the length of a fence required to enclose a plot of land, or the length of a tape placed around a figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This concept is closely related to [[basics_of_perimeter_and_area | area]], which measures the space a figure occupies in two dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

## Perimeter of a Rectangle

A rectangle is a four-sided figure characterized by four right angles, where opposite sides are equal in length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

To calculate the perimeter of a rectangle, you simply sum the lengths of all its sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

### Example: Rectangle ABCD

Consider a rectangle ABCD where side AB is 7 units long, and side BC is 5 units long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   Side AB = 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>
*   Side BC = 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>
*   Since it's a rectangle, side DC will be equal to AB, so DC = 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>
*   Similarly, side DA (or AD) will be equal to BC, so DA = 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>

The perimeter of rectangle ABCD is:
Perimeter = AB + BC + DC + DA
Perimeter = 7 + 5 + 7 + 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>
Perimeter = 12 + 12
Perimeter = 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>

## Perimeter of a Square

A square is a special type of rectangle where all four sides are equal in length, in addition to having four right angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

To find the perimeter of a square, if one side is denoted as 'x', then all sides are 'x' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. The perimeter is simply the sum of all sides: x + x + x + x, which simplifies to 4x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### Example: Square with a Given Perimeter

Suppose a square has a perimeter of 36 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. To find the length of each side:
Let 'x' be the length of one side.
Perimeter = 4x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>
Given Perimeter = 36
So, 4x = 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>

To solve for x, divide both sides by 4:
x = 36 / 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>
x = 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>

Therefore, each side of the square is 9 units long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

## Relationship to Area

While perimeter measures the boundary, [[explaining_area_using_1by1_squares | area]] measures the amount of two-dimensional space a figure occupies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Area is often conceptualized by determining how many "1-by-1 squares" can fit within a figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

For a rectangle, if you consider its length and width, the [[understanding_and_calculating_area_of_rectangles | area is found by multiplying these two dimensions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. For example, a 5 by 7 rectangle has an area of 35 (5 rows of 7 1x1 squares) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

For a square, since all sides are equal, if a side has length 's', the [[calculating_area_of_squares | area is calculated as s multiplied by s]] (s * s or sÂ²) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. This is where the term "squaring" a number originates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. For instance, a 2-by-2 square has an area of 4, as it can fit four 1-by-1 squares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

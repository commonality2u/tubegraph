When analyzing data, it's crucial to understand how spread apart the data is, in addition to its central tendency or average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This involves calculations often categorized under [[descriptive_statistics | descriptive statistics]]. A fundamental distinction in statistics is between a population and a sample <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Defining Population

A **population** refers to the entire set of data being considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. When all data points are available, calculations like the mean or measures of dispersion are referred to as "population" measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. For example, if a data set includes negative 10, 0, 10, 20, and 30, and it's assumed to be the *entire* population, its arithmetic mean is 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Similarly, its [[variance_and_its_calculation_for_population_and_sample | variance]] (sigma squared) is calculated as 200, and its [[standard_deviation_and_sampling_distribution | standard deviation]] (sigma) is the square root of 200, or 10 times the square root of 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

## Defining Sample

In many real-world scenarios, it's not feasible to collect data from an entire population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Instead, statisticians work with a **sample**, which is a subset of the data from the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

The goal when working with a sample is to use its characteristics to estimate properties of the entire population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. For instance, while the video demonstrates calculating the population mean and [[variance_and_its_calculation_for_population_and_sample | variance]] by assuming all data is present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>, future statistical studies often involve estimating these values from a [[sample_size_and_sampling | sample]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This distinction between population and sample is a key concept for those pursuing further studies in statistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## [[Introduction to logarithms | Introduction to Logarithms]]

The [[introduction_to_logarithms | world of logarithms]] is fundamentally about determining the power to which a base number must be raised to yield another number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. This concept is the inverse of exponentiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>.

For instance, while calculating an exponent like 2 to the fourth power means multiplying 2 by itself four times (2 × 2 × 2 × 2), which equals 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>, a logarithmic inquiry poses a different question: "If we start with 2, to what power must it be raised to get 16?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a> The answer to this specific question is 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.

## [[Logarithm properties and notation | Logarithm Notation]]

This relationship is expressed using [[logarithm_properties_and_notation | logarithm notation]] as `log base 2 of 16` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. If we set this equal to `x`, `log base 2 of 16 = x`, it is a statement fully equivalent to the exponential form `2^x = 16` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. Both statements indicate that `x` equals 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

## [[evaluating_logarithmic_expressions | Evaluating Logarithmic Expressions]]

[[evaluating_logarithmic_expressions | Evaluating logarithmic expressions]] involves finding the exponent. You can set the expression equal to an `x` and restate it in exponential form to help solve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.

### [[examples_of_calculating_logarithms | Examples of Calculating Logarithms]]

#### Example 1: `log base 3 of 81`

To [[evaluating_logarithmic_expressions | evaluate]] `log base 3 of 81` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>, you ask: "What power must 3 be raised to to get 81?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>
*   3 to the first power = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>
*   3 to the second power = 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>
*   3 to the third power = 27 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>
*   3 to the fourth power = 81 (27 × 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>
Therefore, `log base 3 of 81 = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

#### Example 2: `log base 6 of 216`

To [[evaluating_logarithmic_expressions | evaluate]] `log base 6 of 216` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>, you ask: "What power must 6 be raised to to get 216?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>
*   6 to the first power = 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>
*   6 to the second power = 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>
*   6 to the third power = 216 (36 × 6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>
So, `log base 6 of 216 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.

#### Example 3: `log base 2 of 64`

To [[evaluating_logarithmic_expressions | evaluate]] `log base 2 of 64` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>, you ask: "What power must 2 be raised to to get 64?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>
*   2 to the first power = 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>
*   2 to the second power = 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>
*   2 to the third power = 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>
*   2 to the fourth power = 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>
*   2 to the fifth power = 32 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>
*   2 to the sixth power = 64 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>
Thus, `log base 2 of 64 = 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>.

#### Example 4: `log base 100 of 1`

To [[evaluating_logarithmic_expressions | evaluate]] `log base 100 of 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>, you ask: "What power must 100 be raised to to get 1?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>
If we set this equal to `x`, `100^x = 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>. Any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 equals 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>.
Therefore, `x` equals 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>, and `log base 100 of 1 = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.
In general, the logarithm of 1 with any base (not zero) will always be 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>.

This article explores the concepts of demand, supply, and how markets naturally adjust towards an equilibrium point using the example of an apple market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Setting Up the Market Graph

To analyze the market for apples, a graph is used with the vertical axis representing the price per pound and the horizontal axis representing the quantity of apples in thousands of pounds for a specific period, such as the next week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Prices are marked from $1 to $5 per pound, and quantities from 1000 to 5000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Demand Curve

The [[law_of_demand_in_microeconomics | demand curve]] illustrates the relationship between the price of apples and the [[factors_influencing_changes_in_demand_and_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] by consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

*   **High Price**: If the price of apples is very high, consumers will not [[factors_influencing_changes_in_demand_and_quantity_demanded | demand]] much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. For example, at a price of $5 per pound, the [[factors_influencing_changes_in_demand_and_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] might be around 500 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   **Low Price**: If the price is low, consumers will [[factors_influencing_changes_in_demand_and_quantity_demanded | demand]] more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. For instance, at $1 per pound, the [[factors_influencing_changes_in_demand_and_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] could be 4000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Quantity Demanded vs. Demand
> "Quantity demanded" refers to a specific amount at a specific price, while "demand" represents the entire relationship between price and quantity demanded across all possible prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

The demand curve slopes downwards, reflecting that as price increases, [[factors_influencing_changes_in_demand_and_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] decreases, and vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Supply Curve

The supply curve illustrates the relationship between the price of apples and the quantity suppliers are willing to produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

*   **Low Price**: There might be a price below which producers are not willing to supply any apples, for example, 50 cents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   **High Price**: As the price increases, the quantity suppliers are willing to supply also increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. For instance, at $1 per pound, suppliers might offer 1000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

The supply curve slopes upwards, indicating that as price increases, [[impact_of_price_changes_on_supply_and_demand | quantity supplied]] increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This analysis can apply to a specific supplier, a local market, or even a global market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## Market Scenarios and Adjustments

### Scenario 1: [[market_shortages_and_surpluses | Shortage]]

Consider a situation where apple suppliers initially set the price at $1 per pound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

*   At this price, the [[impact_of_price_changes_on_supply_and_demand | quantity supplied]] is 1000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   However, the [[factors_influencing_changes_in_demand_and_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] at $1 per pound is 4000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

This creates a [[market_shortages_and_surpluses | shortage]] of 3000 pounds of apples (4000 demanded - 1000 supplied) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

#### Market Adjustment to a Shortage
When a [[market_shortages_and_surpluses | shortage]] occurs:
1.  Consumers will bid up prices because there are more people wanting apples than available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
2.  As prices rise, suppliers will be incentivized to [[impact_of_price_changes_on_supply_and_demand | increase the quantity produced]], moving up along the supply curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
3.  Simultaneously, as prices rise, consumers will [[factors_influencing_changes_in_demand_and_quantity_demanded | demand less]], moving up along the demand curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
This process reduces the [[market_shortages_and_surpluses | shortage]] until the market reaches a more balanced state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

### Scenario 2: [[market_shortages_and_surpluses | Surplus]]

Imagine a scenario where, in response to high demand, suppliers set the price too high, for instance, at $3 per pound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

*   At this price, the [[impact_of_price_changes_on_supply_and_demand | quantity supplied]] is 3000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   However, the [[factors_influencing_changes_in_demand_and_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] at $3 per pound is much lower, about 1300 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

This results in a [[market_shortages_and_surpluses | surplus]] of 1700 pounds of apples (3000 supplied - 1300 demanded) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

#### Market Adjustment to a Surplus
When a [[market_shortages_and_surpluses | surplus]] occurs:
1.  Producers, realizing apples won't last forever and are not being sold, will start reducing prices to attract consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
2.  As prices decrease, suppliers will [[impact_of_price_changes_on_supply_and_demand | produce fewer apples]], moving down along the supply curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
3.  As prices decrease, consumers will [[factors_influencing_changes_in_demand_and_quantity_demanded | demand more]], moving down along the demand curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
This process continues until the [[market_shortages_and_surpluses | surplus]] is eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

## Market Equilibrium

Both [[market_shortages_and_surpluses | shortages]] and [[market_shortages_and_surpluses | surpluses]] naturally lead the market towards a single point where the supply and demand curves intersect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

*   **[[equilibrium_price_and_quantity | Equilibrium Price]]**: This is the price at which the [[impact_of_price_changes_on_supply_and_demand | quantity supplied]] equals the [[factors_influencing_changes_in_demand_and_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. In the apple market example, this is approximately $2.15 per pound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
*   **[[equilibrium_price_and_quantity | Equilibrium Quantity]]**: This is the quantity supplied and demanded at the [[equilibrium_price_and_quantity | equilibrium price]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. In this scenario, it is around 2200 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

At the [[equilibrium_price_and_quantity | equilibrium price]] and [[equilibrium_price_and_quantity | quantity]], assuming no other changes, the market is stable: all apples produced are sold, and none go bad, benefiting both consumers and producers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

A [[definition_of_a_function | function]] is an abstract concept that takes an input, processes it, and produces a single, specific output based on that input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. For any given input, there can only be one possible output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Function Notation

The most common way to denote a function is `f(x)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   `f` is typically the name of the function, though other letters can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   `x` is commonly the [[role_of_variables_in_expressions | variable]] used for the input, serving as a placeholder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. However, other variables can also be used, such as `h(a)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

To evaluate a function for a specific input, you replace the input [[role_of_variables_in_expressions | variable]] (e.g., `x`) with the desired value within the parentheses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. For example, `f(2)` means "evaluate function f with an input of 2" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Examples of Functions

Functions can perform various operations on their inputs.

### Example 1: Conditional Algebraic Operations

Consider a function `f(x)` defined as:
*   `f(x) = x^2` if `x` is even <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>
*   `f(x) = x + 5` if `x` is odd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>

To evaluate `f(2)`:
*   Since 2 is even, we use the first rule: `f(2) = 2^2 = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

To evaluate `f(3)`:
*   Since 3 is odd, we use the second rule: `f(3) = 3 + 5 = 8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### Example 2: Non-Algebraic Operations (A "Wacky" Function)

Functions are not limited to traditional mathematical operations. For instance, a function `h(a)` could be defined as:
*   `h(a)` is the next largest number that starts with the same letter as [[role_of_variables_in_expressions | variable]] `a` (assuming English spelling) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

To evaluate `h(2)`:
*   The number "2" starts with 'T'. The next largest number starting with 'T' is "3" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. So, `h(2) = 3`.

To evaluate `h(8)`:
*   The number "8" starts with 'E'. The next largest number starting with 'E' is "11" (not 9 or 10) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. So, `h(8) = 11`.

### Example 3: Traditional Equations as Functions

Many familiar algebraic equations can be viewed as functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. For example, `y = x + 1` can be written in function notation as `f(x) = x + 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

*   If `x` is the input, `y` is the output.
*   `f(0) = 0 + 1 = 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   `f(2) = 2 + 1 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

You may have encountered this concept previously using tables, where an `x` value is paired with a `y` value:
| x | y |
|---|---|
| 0 | 1 |
| 2 | 3 |
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>

The advantage of function notation is its clarity in showing that an input `x` is processed to produce a specific output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. In the case of `f(x) = x + 1`, the output is always one more than the input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

## What is Not a Function?

A relationship is **not** a [[definition_of_a_function | function]] if a single input can produce more than one possible output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

### Example: A Circle Equation

Consider the equation of a circle centered at the origin with radius 2: `x^2 + y^2 = 2^2`, or `x^2 + y^2 = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

Visually, if you plot this circle on a graph, for a given `x`-value (e.g., `x = 1`), there are two corresponding `y`-values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

Algebraically, let's test `x = 1`:
1.  Substitute `x = 1` into the equation: `1^2 + y^2 = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
2.  Simplify: `1 + y^2 = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
3.  Solve for `y^2`: `y^2 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
4.  Solve for `y`: `y = ±√3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

Since an input of `x = 1` yields two different outputs (`√3` and `-√3`), this relationship is not a [[definition_of_a_function | function]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

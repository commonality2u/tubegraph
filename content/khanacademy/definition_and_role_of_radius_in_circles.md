The circle is considered a fundamental shape in our universe, appearing in phenomena from planetary orbits and wheels to molecular structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. To understand its widespread presence, it is worthwhile to explore some of the [[fundamental_properties_of_circles | properties of the circle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Defining a Circle

A circle is defined as all the points that are equidistant from a central point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This definition ensures that every point along the edge of the circle is the same distance from its center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## The Radius

The specific distance from the center of the circle to any point on its edge is called the **radius** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. By definition, this distance never changes for a given circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. For example, if one radius is 3 centimeters, any other radius drawn from the center to the edge will also be 3 centimeters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Radius and Diameter

The [[understanding_the_diameter_and_its_relation_to_the_radius | diameter]] of a circle is the distance across its widest point, passing through the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This widest point is essentially two radii extending in opposite directions from the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Therefore, the [[understanding_the_diameter_and_its_relation_to_the_radius | diameter]] is equal to two times the radius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## Radius and Circumference

The [[calculating_circumference_and_its_relationship_with_diameter | circumference]] of a circle is the distance around its edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. The relationship between the [[calculating_circumference_and_its_relationship_with_diameter | circumference]] and the [[understanding_the_diameter_and_its_relation_to_the_radius | diameter]] (and thus the radius) is expressed through [[explaining_the_significance_of_pi_in_circle_calculations | pi]] (Ï€) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

The ratio of a circle's [[calculating_circumference_and_its_relationship_with_diameter | circumference]] to its [[understanding_the_diameter_and_its_relation_to_the_radius | diameter]] is always the same constant value, known as [[explaining_the_significance_of_pi_in_circle_calculations | pi]] (approximately 3.14159...) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This means:

$$ \frac{\text{Circumference}}{\text{Diameter}} = \pi $$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>

Rearranging this, the [[calculating_circumference_and_its_relationship_with_diameter | circumference]] (C) can be found by multiplying [[explaining_the_significance_of_pi_in_circle_calculations | pi]] by the [[understanding_the_diameter_and_its_relation_to_the_radius | diameter]] (D):

$$ \text{C} = \pi \text{D} $$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>

Since the [[understanding_the_diameter_and_its_relation_to_the_radius | diameter]] is twice the radius (r), the formula for [[calculating_circumference_and_its_relationship_with_diameter | circumference]] can also be expressed in terms of the radius:

$$ \text{C} = 2 \pi \text{r} $$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>

## Examples

### Calculating Circumference and Diameter from Radius

If a circle has a radius of 3 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>:
*   **Circumference:**
    $$ \text{C} = 2 \pi \text{r} = 2 \times \pi \times 3 \text{ meters} = 6 \pi \text{ meters} $$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>
    This value can be approximated by multiplying 6 by 3.14159, but is often left in terms of [[explaining_the_significance_of_pi_in_circle_calculations | pi]] for exactness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   **Diameter:**
    $$ \text{D} = 2 \times \text{r} = 2 \times 3 \text{ meters} = 6 \text{ meters} $$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>

### Calculating Radius from Circumference

If a circle has a [[calculating_circumference_and_its_relationship_with_diameter | circumference]] of 10 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>:
*   **Diameter:**
    Using the formula $C = \pi D$, we can find the [[understanding_the_diameter_and_its_relation_to_the_radius | diameter]]:
    $$ 10 \text{ meters} = \pi \text{D} $$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>
    $$ \text{D} = \frac{10}{\pi} \text{ meters} $$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>
    This is also often left in terms of [[explaining_the_significance_of_pi_in_circle_calculations | pi]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **Radius:**
    Since the radius is half the [[understanding_the_diameter_and_its_relation_to_the_radius | diameter]]:
    $$ \text{r} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{D} = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{10}{\pi} \text{ meters} = \frac{5}{\pi} \text{ meters} $$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>

The constant value of [[explaining_the_significance_of_pi_in_circle_calculations | pi]], which is just a number (3.14159...), is fundamental to understanding circle measurements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

Solving Inequalities with Absolute Values
[[solving_inequalities_with_absolute_values | Absolute value inequalities]] are often considered one of the most confusing topics in algebra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. However, by keeping the fundamental meaning of [[understanding_absolute_value | absolute value]] in mind, they can be understood intuitively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

### Understanding Absolute Value
The [[understanding_absolute_value | absolute value]] of a number represents its distance from zero on a number line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. For example, the absolute value of -6 is 6, as it is 6 units away from zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Similarly, the absolute value of -11 is 11, as it is 11 units away from zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Visualizing a number line is crucial for solving these problems and avoids the need for memorizing rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### Solving "Less Than" Absolute Value Inequalities
When solving an [[absolute_value_inequalities | absolute value inequality]] where the absolute value is *less than* a number, you are looking for values that are *closer* to zero than that number.

#### Example: $|x| < 12$
To solve $|x| < 12$, we are looking for all values of `x` that are less than 12 units away from 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
On a number line, this includes all numbers between -12 and 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
This translates into a [[compound_inequalities | compound inequality]]:
$x > -12$ AND $x < 12$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
The solution set in interval notation is $(-12, 12)$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

#### Example: $|5x + 3| < 7$
Here, the expression `5x + 3` must be less than 7 units away from 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. This means `5x + 3` must be between -7 and 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
This forms a [[compound_inequalities | compound inequality]]:
$-7 < 5x + 3 < 7$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>
To solve, subtract 3 from all parts of the inequality:
$-7 - 3 < 5x < 7 - 3$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>
$-10 < 5x < 4$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>
Then, divide all parts by 5:
$-2 < x < \frac{4}{5}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>
The solution set is all `x` values greater than -2 and less than 4/5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

### Solving "Greater Than" Absolute Value Inequalities
When solving an [[absolute_value_inequalities | absolute value inequality]] where the absolute value is *greater than* a number, you are looking for values that are *further* from zero than that number.

#### Example: $|7x| \ge 21$
Here, the expression `7x` must be 21 or more units away from 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
On a number line, this means `7x` can be either:
1.  Greater than or equal to positive 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>
2.  Less than or equal to negative 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>
This translates into two separate inequalities (an "or" condition):
$7x \ge 21$ OR $7x \le -21$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>
Solve each inequality:
For $7x \ge 21$: Divide by 7, resulting in $x \ge 3$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
For $7x \le -21$: Divide by 7, resulting in $x \le -3$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
The solution set is $x \ge 3$ OR $x \le -3$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
On a number line, this solution includes values that are 3 or greater, or -3 or less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

#### Example: $\left|\frac{2x}{7} + 9\right| > \frac{5}{7}$
This means the expression $\frac{2x}{7} + 9$ must be more than $\frac{5}{7}$ units away from 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
So, either:
$\frac{2x}{7} + 9 > \frac{5}{7}$ OR $\frac{2x}{7} + 9 < -\frac{5}{7}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>

To solve, first multiply both sides of each inequality by 7 to clear the denominators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>:
For $\frac{2x}{7} + 9 > \frac{5}{7}$:
$7 \left(\frac{2x}{7} + 9\right) > 7 \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)$
$2x + 63 > 5$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>
Subtract 63 from both sides:
$2x > 5 - 63$
$2x > -58$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>
Divide by 2:
$x > -29$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>

For $\frac{2x}{7} + 9 < -\frac{5}{7}$:
$7 \left(\frac{2x}{7} + 9\right) < 7 \left(-\frac{5}{7}\right)$
$2x + 63 < -5$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>
Subtract 63 from both sides:
$2x < -5 - 63$
$2x < -68$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>
Divide by 2:
$x < -34$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>

The solution set is $x > -29$ OR $x < -34$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. On a number line, this means values greater than -29 (but not including -29), or values less than -34 (but not including -34) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.

### General Rules (Visualization is Key)
While it's better to visualize the meaning of [[understanding_absolute_value | absolute value]], general rules can be summarized:
*   If $|f(x)| < a$ (where `a` is a positive number), then $-a < f(x) < a$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This means $f(x)$ must be less than `a` units away from 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   If $|f(x)| > a$ (where `a` is a positive number), then $f(x) > a$ OR $f(x) < -a$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. This means $f(x)$ must be more than `a` units away from 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

From: [[khanacademy]] <br/> 

The [[khan_academy_and_online_education | Khan Academy]] is widely recognized for its extensive collection of educational videos, covering subjects from basic arithmetic to vector calculus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Currently, the platform hosts around 2,200 videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a> and serves approximately a [[khan_academys_global_reach_and_user_statistics | million students]] per month, with users watching between 100,000 to 200,000 videos daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Origin and Initial Insights

The founder, Salman Khan, began the initiative by remotely tutoring his cousins in New Orleans while working as a hedge fund analyst in Boston <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. He started uploading videos to YouTube primarily as a supplement for his cousins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

A key revelation came from his cousins themselves, who preferred learning from the YouTube videos rather than in-person tutoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. This seemingly "backhanded" feedback highlighted several profound advantages of the automated approach:
*   **Self-Paced Learning** Students could pause and repeat sections without feeling they were wasting the tutor's time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Reduced Embarrassment** Learners could review foundational concepts they might have forgotten without shame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **Intimacy of Learning** The process of grappling with new concepts occurred in the privacy of their own space, free from the pressure of an immediate human assessment like "do you understand this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

Beyond his family, Khan began receiving overwhelmingly positive feedback from random people worldwide, including comments like "First time I smiled doing a derivative" and testimonials about achieving a "natural high" from understanding complex topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. These interactions underscored the content's widespread utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

A particularly impactful letter came from a parent whose 12-year-old son with autism had struggled immensely with math. After trying numerous other resources, the son found success with Khan Academy's videos on decimals and fractions, leading to excitement and newfound comprehension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. This demonstrated the platform's potential for significant social value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

## Flipping the Classroom

Initially, Khan viewed the videos as a supplement for motivated or homeschooled students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. However, he started receiving letters from teachers who were using the videos to "flip the classroom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. This approach involves assigning video lectures for homework and then dedicating class time to what was traditionally homework, with students doing practice exercises in the classroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

This "flipped classroom" model offers several benefits:
*   **Student Pace** Students can engage with lectures at their own speed, pausing and replaying as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   **Humanizing the Classroom** By removing the "one size fits all" lecture from the classroom, technology actually humanizes the learning experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. Teachers can walk around, intervene individually, and students can interact with each other and their peers, fostering a more collaborative and less dehumanizing environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

## Mastery-Based Learning and Data-Driven Exercises

To take the "flipped classroom" concept further, Khan Academy developed interactive exercises that integrate with the videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. The core paradigm for these exercises is mastery-based: students must answer 10 questions correctly in a row to demonstrate proficiency before moving on to the next concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Hints and step-by-step solutions are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

This model fundamentally differs from traditional classrooms where snapshot exams allow students to move on with incomplete understanding, creating "Swiss cheese gaps" in their knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Khan compares this to learning to ride a bicycle and being stamped with a C grade for an 80% performance, then being given a unicycle before achieving mastery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. The Khan Academy model encourages experimentation and failure, but ultimately *expects mastery* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

The platform organizes content into a "knowledge map," starting with basic concepts like single-digit addition and progressing to advanced arithmetic, algebra, and precalculus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. This framework aims to teach everything that can be taught in such a structured manner, including logic, computer programming, grammar, and genetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

## Data in the Classroom: The Los Altos Pilot

Khan Academy piloted its software in the Los Altos school district, involving two fifth-grade and two seventh-grade classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. These classes replaced traditional textbooks and "one size fits all" lectures with Khan Academy for roughly half of their math class time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. This freed up class time for more engaging activities like simulations, games, and project-based learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

A key innovation is the teacher dashboard, which provides [[personalized_learning_approaches | data-driven insights]] into student progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>:
*   Each row represents a student, and each column a concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.
*   **Green** indicates proficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
*   **Blue** means the student is working on the concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.
*   **Red** signals that a student is stuck and needs intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

Teachers can then intervene with students who are struggling ("red kids") or even leverage proficient students ("green kids") for peer tutoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

### Granular Data for Teacher Intervention

The system arms teachers with detailed data, enabling them to diagnose specific issues and make interactions more productive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. Teachers can see:
*   How long students spend on activities daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.
*   Which videos they watch, when they pause, and what they stop watching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.
*   Which exercises they use and their focus areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
*   The exact problems a student got right (blue) or wrong (red), showing their [[the_journey_of_learning | learning journey]] and progress toward mastery (e.g., getting 10 in a row correctly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. The height of the bar indicates the time taken for each problem, showing how students get faster with practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.

### Challenging Labels with Self-Paced Learning

Self-paced learning, also known as [[personalized_learning_approaches | differentiated learning]], reveals interesting patterns in the classroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. When given the freedom to work at their own pace, students who might initially appear "slow" (taking more time on certain concepts) often race ahead once they achieve mastery in those areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. This observation challenges traditional labels of "gifted" or "slow," suggesting that such classifications often stem from the "coincidence of time" in a rigid, traditional curriculum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>, reinforcing the [[universality_of_learning_capability | universality of learning capability]].

## Broader Impact and Future Vision

Khan Academy's goal is to use technology to humanize education not just locally but on a [[global_education_and_accessibility | global scale]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. The focus shifts from traditional student-to-teacher ratios to "student to valuable human time with the teacher" ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. By offloading lectures and grading, teachers can spend 100% of their time actively working with students, multiplying valuable interaction time significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

This model holds immense value for:
*   **Adult Learners** who may be embarrassed to review foundational knowledge before returning to college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.
*   **Disadvantaged Youth** such as a street kid in Calcutta who cannot attend school during the day but can remediate or catch up at their own pace without embarrassment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.

The vision extends to a "global one world classroom," where the peer-to-peer tutoring seen in local classrooms can transcend geographical boundaries, allowing students from different parts of the world to tutor each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.

## Motivation and Gamification

To further engage students, Khan Academy incorporates game mechanics, including badges, energy points, and leaderboards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. Even subtle changes in badge wording or point allocation can significantly influence the learning behavior of tens of thousands of students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

## Collaboration and Readiness

The collaboration with the Los Altos school district began when they approached Khan Academy, open to radical changes. The district's quick adoption, starting a pilot within two weeks, demonstrated their enthusiasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>. A key benefit for the district is the continuous data tracking, allowing them to follow students' progress across grades and even during breaks like summer or Christmas, providing invaluable continuity of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>.

Many of the teacher dashboard features were developed based on direct feedback and specifications from the teachers themselves, highlighting a tight design loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>. Salman Khan believes the system is "ready for prime time" and can be implemented in classrooms globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>. The coaching dashboard is also available for anyone to use as a mentor for their own children or other students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.

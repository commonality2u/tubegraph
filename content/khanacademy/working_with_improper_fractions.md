An improper fraction is a fraction where the numerator (the top number) is larger than the denominator (the bottom number) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. When an improper fraction is converted to a decimal or a mixed number, the resulting value will always be greater than one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

## Converting Improper Fractions to Decimals

The method for [[converting_fractions_to_decimals | converting fractions to decimals]] applies equally to improper fractions. To convert any fraction to a decimal, divide the denominator into the numerator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

### Example: Converting 17/9 to a Decimal

Let's convert the improper fraction 17/9 to a decimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

1.  Set up the division: Divide 9 (the denominator) into 17 (the numerator) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
2.  Add a decimal point and trailing zeros to the numerator to allow for decimal precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
    ```
    ```
    ```
      ______
    9 | 17.000
    ```
3.  Perform the division:
    *   9 goes into 17 one time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Place "1" above the 7 in the quotient.
    *   Multiply 1 by 9, which is 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
    *   Subtract 9 from 17, which leaves 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
    *   Bring down the next digit (a 0) to make 80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Place the decimal point in the quotient directly above the decimal point in the dividend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
    ```
        1.
      ______
    9 | 17.000
        - 9
        ---
          8 0
    ```
    *   9 goes into 80 eight times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Place "8" after the decimal point in the quotient.
    *   Multiply 8 by 9, which is 72 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
    *   Subtract 72 from 80, which leaves 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
    *   Bring down another 0 to make 80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
    ```
        1.8
      ______
    9 | 17.000
        - 9
        ---
          8 0
        - 7 2
        -----
            8 0
    ```
4.  Identify repeating patterns: A pattern of 8s begins to form, meaning the division will continue indefinitely with 8 as the repeating digit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
5.  Write the final decimal: 17/9 is equal to 1.888... <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. This can be written as 1.8 with a line over the 8, indicating that the 8 repeats forever.
    *   The value can be rounded for approximation, for example, to 1.89 if rounded to the hundredths place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

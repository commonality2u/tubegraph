After [[atp_production_and_consumption_in_glycolysis | glycolysis]] and the Krebs cycle, cellular respiration has produced 10 [[role_of_nadh_and_fadh2_in_atp_production | NADH]] and 2 [[role_of_nadh_and_fadh2_in_atp_production | FADH2]] molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. These molecules are crucial for the next stage, the [[electron_transport_chain | electron transport chain]] (ETC), which takes place in the matrix of the mitochondria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The ultimate goal of the [[electron_transport_chain | electron transport chain]] is to generate [[electron_transport_chain_and_atp_production | ATP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. While much about this process is well-established, some intricate details, such as the exact workings of certain proteins, remain areas of ongoing research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Role of NADH and FADH2

Both [[role_of_nadh_and_fadh2_in_atp_production | NADH]] and [[role_of_nadh_and_fadh2_in_atp_production | FADH2]] carry high-energy electrons to the [[electron_transport_chain | electron transport chain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   Each [[role_of_nadh_and_fadh2_in_atp_production | NADH]] molecule is indirectly responsible for the production of approximately three [[electron_transport_chain_and_atp_production | ATP]] molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   Each [[role_of_nadh_and_fadh2_in_atp_production | FADH2]] molecule is indirectly responsible for the production of approximately two [[electron_transport_chain_and_atp_production | ATP]] molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   The difference in [[electron_transport_chain_and_atp_production | ATP]] yield is because electrons from [[role_of_nadh_and_fadh2_in_atp_production | FADH2]] enter the [[electron_transport_chain | electron transport chain]] at a slightly lower energy level than those from [[role_of_nadh_and_fadh2_in_atp_production | NADH]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Electron Transport Chain Overview

The [[overview_of_the_electron_transport_chain | electron transport chain]] begins with the oxidation of [[role_of_nadh_and_fadh2_in_atp_production | NADH]] and [[role_of_nadh_and_fadh2_in_atp_production | FADH2]]:

### Oxidation of NADH
[[role_of_nadh_and_fadh2_in_atp_production | NADH]] loses two electrons, becoming [[role_of_nadh_and_fadh2_in_atp_production | NAD+]], which can then be reused in the Krebs cycle and [[atp_production_and_consumption_in_glycolysis | glycolysis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>
```
NADH → NAD+ + H+ + 2e-
```

### Electron Movement and Energy Release
The electrons are transported through a series of "transition molecules" (e.g., coenzyme Q, cytochrome C) within large protein complexes embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane (cristae) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. As electrons move from one molecule to the next, they transition to slightly lower energy states, releasing energy in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

### Reduction of Oxygen
The final step of the [[electron_transport_chain | electron transport chain]] involves oxygen. The two electrons, along with two hydrogen protons, reduce an oxygen atom to form water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>
```
2e- + 2H+ + 1/2 O2 → H2O
```
This is the reduction of oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

## Proton Gradient Formation (Chemiosmosis)

The energy released by electrons moving through the [[electron_transport_chain | electron transport chain]] is harnessed by protein complexes spanning the cristae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. These proteins utilize the energy to actively pump hydrogen protons (H+) from the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space (the outer compartment) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

This creates a proton (electrochemical) gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane:
*   **Concentration Gradient:** The outer compartment develops a significantly higher concentration of hydrogen protons, making it more acidic than the matrix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
*   **Electrical Gradient:** The outer compartment becomes slightly positively charged due to the accumulation of protons, while the matrix becomes relatively negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

Protons naturally want to move back into the matrix down this steep electrochemical gradient, but the inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

## ATP Synthase Mechanism

The formed proton gradient is the direct energy source for [[electron_transport_chain_and_atp_production | ATP]] synthesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Protons re-enter the matrix only through a specialized protein channel and enzyme complex called **[[electron_transport_chain_and_atp_production | ATP]] synthase** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

### The Rotational Engine Model
The current model for [[electron_transport_chain_and_atp_production | ATP]] synthase function describes it as a molecular motor:
1.  **Proton Flow:** As hydrogen protons flow through [[electron_transport_chain_and_atp_production | ATP]] synthase from the outer compartment back into the matrix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>, they cause an internal "axle" or rotor part of the protein to spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. This is analogous to water flowing through a turbine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.
2.  **Conformational Change:** The spinning axle interacts with a stationary part of the [[electron_transport_chain_and_atp_production | ATP]] synthase (called the F1 part) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. This mechanical rotation causes conformational changes (stretching and pulling) in the stationary part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.
3.  **ATP Synthesis:** These mechanical distortions force adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and an inorganic phosphate (Pi) molecule together, providing the energy needed to form a high-energy phosphodiester bond, thereby synthesizing [[electron_transport_chain_and_atp_production | ATP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. This process is thought to occur simultaneously at multiple sites on the enzyme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

## ATP Yield

The efficiency of [[electron_transport_chain_and_atp_production | ATP]] production can vary due to factors like proton leakage or electron "jumping" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>, but in an ideal scenario:
*   Each [[role_of_nadh_and_fadh2_in_atp_production | NADH]] indirectly produces about 3 [[electron_transport_chain_and_atp_production | ATP]]s by creating enough of a proton gradient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>.
*   Each [[role_of_nadh_and_fadh2_in_atp_production | FADH2]] indirectly produces about 2 [[electron_transport_chain_and_atp_production | ATP]]s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>.

Considering the products from [[atp_production_and_consumption_in_glycolysis | glycolysis]] and the Krebs cycle:
*   10 [[role_of_nadh_and_fadh2_in_atp_production | NADH]] × 3 [[electron_transport_chain_and_atp_production | ATP]]/[[role_of_nadh_and_fadh2_in_atp_production | NADH]] = 30 [[electron_transport_chain_and_atp_production | ATP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>
*   2 [[role_of_nadh_and_fadh2_in_atp_production | FADH2]] × 2 [[electron_transport_chain_and_atp_production | ATP]]/[[role_of_nadh_and_fadh2_in_atp_production | FADH2]] = 4 [[electron_transport_chain_and_atp_production | ATP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>
*   Direct [[electron_transport_chain_and_atp_production | ATP]] from [[atp_production_and_consumption_in_glycolysis | glycolysis]] = 2 [[electron_transport_chain_and_atp_production | ATP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>
*   Direct [[electron_transport_chain_and_atp_production | ATP]] from Krebs cycle = 2 [[electron_transport_chain_and_atp_production | ATP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>
*   Total ideal [[energy_efficiency_and_atp_yield_of_cellular_respiration | ATP]] yield = 30 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 38 [[electron_transport_chain_and_atp_production | ATP]] per molecule of glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>.

This entire process, from the initial electron transfer to the final [[electron_transport_chain_and_atp_production | ATP]] synthesis by [[electron_transport_chain_and_atp_production | ATP]] synthase, constitutes the core of [[energy_production_through_cellular_respiration | energy production through cellular respiration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

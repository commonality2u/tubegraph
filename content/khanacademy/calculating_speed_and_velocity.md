When discussing how fast an object moves, it's important to distinguish between speed and velocity, as they are distinct concepts rooted in the difference between scalar and vector quantities.

## Vectors and Scalars

*   **Vector**: A quantity that possesses both a magnitude (size) and a direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   **Scalar**: A quantity that possesses only a magnitude (size) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

Understanding this distinction is crucial for defining and [[understanding_speed_and_velocity | understanding speed and velocity]].

### Distance vs. Displacement

To illustrate the difference between vectors and scalars, consider the movement of an object:

*   **Distance (Scalar)**: If an object moves 5 meters, stating only "5 meters" describes the *distance* it traveled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This is a scalar quantity because it only specifies the magnitude of the movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, without indicating the direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. You wouldn't know if it moved left, right, up, or down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **Displacement (Vector)**: If the same object moves 5 meters "to the right," this is its *displacement* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. This is a vector quantity because it specifies both the magnitude (5 meters) and the direction (to the right) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Displacement is the vector version of distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

## Speed vs. Velocity

Just as distance relates to displacement, speed relates to velocity:

*   **Time**: For simple physics, time is generally considered to move in one direction and is often treated as a scalar quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

### Calculating Speed

Speed tells you "how fast" something is going <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. It is a **scalar quantity** because it only provides the magnitude of how fast an object is moving, without indicating direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

To calculate speed, you divide the total distance traveled by the time taken.
For example, if a brick moves a distance of 5 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a> in 2 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>:

*   **Calculation**: 5 meters / 2 seconds = 2.5 meters per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>
*   **Result**: The speed of the brick is 2.5 meters per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

### Calculating Velocity

Velocity specifies both "how fast" an object is going and "in what direction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. It is a **vector quantity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

To calculate velocity, you divide the displacement by the time taken.
Using the same example, if the brick is displaced 5 meters to the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a> in 2 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>:

*   **Calculation**: 5 meters to the right / 2 seconds = 2.5 meters per second to the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>
*   **Result**: The velocity is 2.5 meters per second to the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

In summary:
*   **Distance** is a scalar, **displacement** is a vector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   **Speed** is a scalar, **velocity** is a vector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

A function defined as `f(x) = 3x² + 6x - 2` is a quadratic function, which has a [[graphing_quadratic_functions_and_identifying_their_parabolic_shape | parabolic shape]] when graphed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Parabolas exhibit a distinct symmetry, which is crucial for understanding their behavior, especially when determining their range.

## Understanding the Parabola's Shape and Symmetry

A parabola is characterized by its unique U-shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. They can either open upwards or downwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. The most significant point on a parabola is its [[vertex_of_a_parabola_and_its_significance | vertex]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

### The Vertex

The [[vertex_of_a_parabola_and_its_significance | vertex]] represents the point where the parabola reaches its minimum value (if it opens upwards) or its maximum value (if it opens downwards) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. For a quadratic function in the standard form `ax² + bx + c`, the x-coordinate of the [[vertex_of_a_parabola_and_its_significance | vertex]] can be found using the formula `-b / 2a` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This formula is derived directly from the quadratic formula, which itself comes from completing the square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

For the given function `f(x) = 3x² + 6x - 2`:
*   `a = 3`
*   `b = 6`
*   The x-coordinate of the [[vertex_of_a_parabola_and_its_significance | vertex]] is `-6 / (2 * 3) = -6 / 6 = -1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   To find the y-coordinate of the [[vertex_of_a_parabola_and_its_significance | vertex]], substitute x = -1 into the function:
    `f(-1) = 3(-1)² + 6(-1) - 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>
    `f(-1) = 3(1) - 6 - 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>
    `f(-1) = 3 - 6 - 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>
    `f(-1) = -3 - 2 = -5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>
    Therefore, the [[vertex_of_a_parabola_and_its_significance | vertex]] of this parabola is at `(-1, -5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

### Observing Symmetry

The parabola exhibits symmetry around a vertical line passing through its [[vertex_of_a_parabola_and_its_significance | vertex]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. This means that if you fold the graph along this line (x = -1 in this case), the two halves of the parabola would perfectly align <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

We can observe this [[understanding_binomial_distribution_and_symmetry_in_probability | symmetry]] by evaluating function values around the [[vertex_of_a_parabola_and_its_significance | vertex]]:
*   At `x = -1`, `f(x) = -5` (the [[vertex_of_a_parabola_and_its_significance | vertex]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   Moving one unit away from the [[vertex_of_a_parabola_and_its_significance | vertex]] to the left, at `x = -2`:
    `f(-2) = 3(-2)² + 6(-2) - 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>
    `f(-2) = 3(4) - 12 - 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>
    `f(-2) = 12 - 12 - 2 = -2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
    So, the point `(-2, -2)` is on the graph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
*   Moving one unit away from the [[vertex_of_a_parabola_and_its_significance | vertex]] to the right, at `x = 0`:
    `f(0) = 3(0)² + 6(0) - 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>
    `f(0) = 0 + 0 - 2 = -2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
    So, the point `(0, -2)` is on the graph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

Notice that `f(-2)` and `f(0)` both yield the same y-value of `-2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This demonstrates the [[understanding_binomial_distribution_and_symmetry_in_probability | symmetry]] around the x-coordinate of the [[vertex_of_a_parabola_and_its_significance | vertex]] (x = -1).

## Domain and Range

### Domain
The domain of a function refers to the set of all valid input (x) values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. For `f(x) = 3x² + 6x - 2`, any real number can be squared, multiplied, added, or subtracted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Therefore, the domain of this function is all real numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Real numbers include pretty much everything except complex numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### Range
The range of a function is the set of all possible output (y) values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Since this parabola opens upwards (because the coefficient of `x²` is positive, `a=3`), the [[vertex_of_a_parabola_and_its_significance | vertex]] at `(-1, -5)` represents the minimum point of the function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. The function can take on any value greater than or equal to this minimum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
As `x` values move away from the [[vertex_of_a_parabola_and_its_significance | vertex]] (either increasing to the right or decreasing to the left), the `f(x)` values increase indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
Thus, the function `f(x)` will never be less than `-5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
The range is all real numbers greater than or equal to `-5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

Graphing the points `(-2, -2)`, `(-1, -5)`, `(0, -2)`, and `(1, 7)` allows for a visual understanding of the parabola's shape and its [[understanding_binomial_distribution_and_symmetry_in_probability | symmetry]] around the [[vertex_of_a_parabola_and_its_significance | vertex]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. The [[graphical_interpretation_of_quadratic_solutions | graphical interpretation of quadratic solutions]] further emphasizes how the shape and [[vertex_of_a_parabola_and_its_significance | vertex]] define the range of the function.

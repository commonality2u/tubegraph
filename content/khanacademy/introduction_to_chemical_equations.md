[[balancing_chemical_equations | Balancing equations]] is a concept taught in first-year chemistry that can be challenging for students, despite being a straightforward idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Its difficulty stems from having "a bit of an art to it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## What is a Chemical Equation?
A [[definition_and_purpose_of_chemical_equations | chemical equation]] essentially describes a chemical reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. It illustrates what substances react and what products are formed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

*   **Reactants**: These are the substances that react, typically found on the left side of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   **Products**: These are the substances formed as a result of the reaction, typically found on the right side of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### The Problem of Unbalanced Equations
Initially, a chemical equation might show different numbers of atoms for a given element on the reactant versus the product side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. For example, in an unbalanced equation for aluminum reacting with oxygen, there might be one aluminum atom on the reactant side and two on the product side, or two oxygen atoms on the reactant side and three on the product side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

[[balancing_chemical_equations | Balancing equations]] aims to fix this issue by ensuring the same number of atoms for each element on both sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## [[methods_to_solve_balancing_equations | Methods to Solve Balancing Equations]]
The primary [[steps_to_balance_a_chemical_equation | method to balance a chemical equation]] involves adjusting the coefficients (the numbers in front of the chemical formulas) of the molecules to achieve an equal count of each atom on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### Key Principles for [[basics_of_balancing_chemical_equations | Balancing Chemical Equations]]
*   **Coefficients Only**: You can only change the number of whole molecules present in the equation by adding coefficients; you cannot alter the internal composition or subscripts of the molecules themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. For instance, you cannot change the ratio of aluminum to oxygen within an aluminum oxide molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **[[whole_number_convention_in_chemical_equations | Whole Number Convention]]**: Chemical equations must have whole numbers as coefficients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. If a balancing step results in a fraction (e.g., 1.5), multiply the entire equation by a factor that converts all coefficients to whole numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   **Strategy**: It's generally advised to balance atoms within more complex molecules first, and then address single-atom molecules (like O₂) last, as adjusting their coefficients won't affect other atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **Polyatomic Ions**: If a polyatomic group (like sulfate, SO₄) remains intact on both sides of the equation, it can be treated as a single unit, simplifying the balancing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

### Example 1: Aluminum and Oxygen
```
Al + O₂ → Al₂O₃
```
1.  **Aluminum (Al)**: There is 1 Al on the left and 2 Al on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Add a coefficient of 2 to Al on the left:
    `2Al + O₂ → Al₂O₃` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>
    (Now there are 2 Al on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.)
2.  **Oxygen (O)**: There are 2 O on the left and 3 O on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. To get a common multiple (6), multiply O₂ by 1.5:
    `2Al + 1.5O₂ → Al₂O₃` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>
    (Now there are 3 O on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.)
3.  **[[whole_number_convention_in_chemical_equations | Clear Fractions]]**: Since you cannot have half an atom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, multiply the entire equation by 2 to get whole numbers:
    `2 * (2Al + 1.5O₂ → Al₂O₃)`
    `4Al + 3O₂ → 2Al₂O₃` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>
    (Final check: 4 Al on left, 4 Al on right; 6 O on left, 6 O on right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.)

### Example 2: Methane Combustion
```
C₂H₄(g) + O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + H₂O(l)
```
1.  **Carbon (C)**: There are 2 C on the left and 1 C on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. Add a coefficient of 2 to CO₂:
    `C₂H₄(g) + O₂(g) → 2CO₂(g) + H₂O(l)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>
    (Now 2 C on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.)
2.  **Hydrogen (H)**: There are 4 H on the left and 2 H in H₂O on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Add a coefficient of 2 to H₂O:
    `C₂H₄(g) + O₂(g) → 2CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(l)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>
    (Now 4 H on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.)
3.  **Oxygen (O)**: There are 2 O on the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. On the right, there are (2 * 2) = 4 O from CO₂ and (2 * 1) = 2 O from H₂O, totaling 6 O <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. To get 6 O on the left, add a coefficient of 3 to O₂:
    `C₂H₄(g) + 3O₂(g) → 2CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(l)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>
    (Final check: 2 C, 4 H, 6 O on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.)

### Example 3: Ethane Combustion (with fraction handling)
```
C₂H₆ + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O
```
1.  **Carbon (C)**: There are 2 C on the left and 1 C on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Add a coefficient of 2 to CO₂:
    `C₂H₆ + O₂ → 2CO₂ + H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>
2.  **Hydrogen (H)**: There are 6 H on the left and 2 H in H₂O on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. Add a coefficient of 3 to H₂O:
    `C₂H₆ + O₂ → 2CO₂ + 3H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>
    (Now 6 H on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.)
3.  **Oxygen (O)**: There are 2 O on the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. On the right, there are (2 * 2) = 4 O from CO₂ and (3 * 1) = 3 O from H₂O, totaling 7 O <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. To get 7 O on the left, add a coefficient of 3.5 to O₂:
    `C₂H₆ + 3.5O₂ → 2CO₂ + 3H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>
4.  **[[whole_number_convention_in_chemical_equations | Clear Fractions]]**: Multiply the entire equation by 2 to remove the 0.5:
    `2 * (C₂H₆ + 3.5O₂ → 2CO₂ + 3H₂O)`
    `2C₂H₆ + 7O₂ → 4CO₂ + 6H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>
    (Final check: 4 C, 12 H, 14 O on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.)

### Example 4: Using Polyatomic Ion Substitution
```
Fe₂O₃ + H₂SO₄ → Fe₂(SO₄)₃ + H₂O
```
Recognize that the sulfate group (SO₄) remains intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. Substitute SO₄ with 'x' to simplify:
```
Fe₂O₃ + H₂x → Fe₂x₃ + H₂O
```
1.  **Iron (Fe)**: There are 2 Fe on the left and 2 Fe on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. Iron is balanced.
2.  **Oxygen (O)** (outside of SO₄): There are 3 O in Fe₂O₃ on the left and 1 O in H₂O on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Add a coefficient of 3 to H₂O:
    `Fe₂O₃ + H₂x → Fe₂x₃ + 3H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>
3.  **Hydrogen (H)**: There are 2 H in H₂x on the left and (3 * 2) = 6 H in 3H₂O on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. To get 6 H on the left, add a coefficient of 3 to H₂x:
    `Fe₂O₃ + 3H₂x → Fe₂x₃ + 3H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>
4.  **Sulfate (x)**: There are 3 'x' groups on the left (from 3H₂x) and 3 'x' groups on the right (from Fe₂x₃) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. Sulfate is balanced.

Un-substitute 'x' back to SO₄:
`Fe₂O₃ + 3H₂SO₄ → Fe₂(SO₄)₃ + 3H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>
(The equation is now balanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.)

### Example 5: Carbon Dioxide and Hydrogen
```
CO₂ + H₂ → CH₄ + H₂O
```
1.  **Carbon (C)**: There is 1 C on the left and 1 C on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. Carbon is balanced.
2.  **Oxygen (O)**: There are 2 O on the left and 1 O in H₂O on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. Add a coefficient of 2 to H₂O:
    `CO₂ + H₂ → CH₄ + 2H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>
3.  **Hydrogen (H)**: There are 2 H on the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. On the right, there are 4 H in CH₄ and (2 * 2) = 4 H in 2H₂O, totaling 8 H <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. To get 8 H on the left, add a coefficient of 4 to H₂:
    `CO₂ + 4H₂ → CH₄ + 2H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>
    (The equation is now balanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.)

[[introduction_to_negative_numbers | Negative numbers]], initially appearing "deep and mysterious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, are actually quite common in everyday life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Generally, a [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negative number]] is any number less than zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Visualizing them through practical examples like temperature and bank accounts can clarify their meaning and how to perform [[negative_number_arithmetic | arithmetic]] with them.

## Temperature as a Real-Life Example

Temperature is a practical context for [[reallife_examples_of_negative_numbers | negative numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
Consider a scale where 0 degrees Celsius is a reference point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Temperatures above zero are positive (e.g., 1, 2, 3 degrees Celsius) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Scenario: Temperature Drop
If it's currently 3 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a> and the temperature is predicted to drop 4 degrees colder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>:
*   Dropping 1 degree would make it 2 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   Dropping 2 degrees would make it 1 degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   Dropping 3 degrees would make it 0 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   To drop 4 degrees, you must go one more degree below 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This point is called negative 1 (-1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

### Understanding Negative Temperature on a Number Line
On a [[understanding_negative_numbers_on_a_number_line | number line]], as you move to the right of 0, values increase (positive numbers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. As you move to the left, you encounter [[understanding_negative_numbers_on_a_number_line | negative numbers]]: -1, -2, -3, and so on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. It's crucial to understand that negative 3 (-3) is *less than* negative 1 (-1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, meaning it's colder or has less heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Similarly, negative 100 (-100) is much smaller than negative 1 (-1), indicating a greater lack of heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Bank Accounts as a Real-Life Example

Bank accounts also frequently use [[reallife_examples_of_negative_numbers | negative numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
Having a positive balance means the bank owes you money, and you have funds to spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

### Scenario: Spending More Than You Have
If you start with $10 in your bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a> and then spend $30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a> (assuming a flexible bank that allows overdrafts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>:
*   You are starting at $10 on a [[understanding_negative_numbers_on_a_number_line | number line]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   Spending $30 means moving 30 spaces to the left on the [[understanding_negative_numbers_on_a_number_line | number line]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   Spending the first $10 brings you to $0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   Spending another $10 (total $20 spent) brings you to negative $10 (-$10) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   Spending a final $10 (total $30 spent) brings you to negative $20 (-$20) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
*   Therefore, $10 minus $30 equals negative $20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   A negative balance, like -$20, means you owe the bank money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. You have gone "in reverse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

## Visualizing Number Line Movements

The [[understanding_negative_numbers_on_a_number_line | number line]] is an essential tool for [[visualizing_number_line_for_inequalities | visualizing negative numbers]] and understanding [[adding_and_subtracting_negative_numbers | addition and subtraction]]:
*   When you subtract or experience a decrease (like getting colder or spending money), you move to the left on the [[understanding_negative_numbers_on_a_number_line | number line]], and the numbers get smaller, even going below zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   When you add or experience an increase (like getting a paycheck), you move to the right on the [[understanding_negative_numbers_on_a_number_line | number line]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Basic [[adding_negative_numbers | Adding Negative Numbers]] and [[subtracting_negative_numbers | Subtracting Negative Numbers]] Examples

Visualizing these operations on a [[understanding_negative_numbers_on_a_number_line | number line]] makes them intuitive:

*   **3 - 4**:
    *   Start at 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.
    *   Subtracting 4 means moving 4 units to the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
    *   Result: -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

*   **2 - 8**:
    *   Start at 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.
    *   Subtracting 8 means moving 8 units to the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
    *   Moving 2 units left reaches 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
    *   You still need to move 6 more units to the left (8 - 2 = 6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
    *   Result: -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

*   **-4 - 2**:
    *   Start at -4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
    *   Subtracting 2 means moving 2 units to the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
    *   Moving 1 unit left reaches -5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
    *   Moving another 1 unit left reaches -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
    *   Result: -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

*   **-3 + 2**:
    *   Start at -3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
    *   Adding 2 means moving 2 units to the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
    *   Moving 1 unit right reaches -2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
    *   Moving another 1 unit right reaches -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
    *   Result: -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

Understanding [[dealing_with_negative_numbers_in_equations | negative numbers in equations]] by visualizing their position and movement on a [[understanding_negative_numbers_on_a_number_line | number line]] provides a strong foundation for [[negative_number_arithmetic | arithmetic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. More examples, including [[subtracting_negative_numbers | subtracting negative numbers]], will be explored further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

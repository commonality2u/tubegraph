The [[kidney_overview_and_function | kidney]] is an organ responsible for excreting waste and maintaining appropriate levels of water, salts (electrolytes), and blood pressure in the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Within a zoomed-in, sliced view of the [[kidney_overview_and_function | kidney]], two distinct regions, the renal cortex and renal medulla, are visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. These regions play a significant role in the [[blood_filtration_process_in_the_nephron | filtration]] process and waste excretion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. The term "renal" consistently refers to anything associated with the [[kidney_overview_and_function | kidney]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## Renal Cortex

The renal cortex is the outer part of the [[kidney_overview_and_function | kidney]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. It is the region where the initial part of the [[nephron_structure_and_function | nephron]], specifically the Bowman's capsule (where [[blood_filtration_process_in_the_nephron | filtration]] begins), is located <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. The [[nephron_structure_and_function | nephron]] begins in the cortex, dips down into the medulla, and then returns to the cortex before draining into collecting ducts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

## Renal Medulla

The renal medulla is the inner region of the [[kidney_overview_and_function | kidney]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The term "medulla" means middle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. A crucial function of the renal medulla, facilitated by the loop of Henle, is to become highly salty (hypertonic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. This saltiness is achieved by actively pumping out salts like sodium, potassium, and chloride ions from the ascending part of the loop of Henle, a process that requires ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. This hypertonic environment is vital for the [[water_and_solute_reabsorption_in_the_nephron | reabsorption]] of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

## Interplay of Cortex and Medulla in Nephron Function

The [[nephron_structure_and_function | nephron]], the [[nephron_structure_and_function | functional unit of the kidney]], spans both the renal cortex and the renal medulla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

*   **Filtration (Cortex)**: The initial [[blood_filtration_process_in_the_nephron | filtration]] of blood occurs in the Bowman's capsule, located in the renal cortex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Here, about a fifth of the fluid, along with small dissolved molecules like ions, glucose, and amino acids, is squeezed out of the blood to form filtrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Larger molecules and blood cells are not filtered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   **Water and Solute Reabsorption (Cortex & Medulla)**:
    *   **Proximal Tubule (Cortex)**: Following [[blood_filtration_process_in_the_nephron | filtration]], the filtrate enters the proximal tubule, also in the cortex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. This section begins the [[water_and_solute_reabsorption_in_the_nephron | reabsorption]] of essential substances like glucose, sodium, and amino acids back into the bloodstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Some water is also reabsorbed here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.
    *   **Loop of Henle (Medulla)**: The loop of Henle extends from the cortex deep into the renal medulla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. Its descending limb is permeable only to water, allowing water to passively leave the tubule into the salty medulla, significantly contributing to [[water_and_solute_reabsorption_in_the_nephron | water reabsorption]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. The ascending limb actively pumps out salts into the medulla, making the medulla hypertonic, but it is impermeable to water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.
    *   **Distal Tubule (Cortex)**: After the loop of Henle, the filtrate re-enters the cortex in the distal convoluted tubule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. Further [[water_and_solute_reabsorption_in_the_nephron | reabsorption]] of substances like calcium and more sodium, as well as some water, occurs here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.
*   **Collecting Ducts (Medulla)**: The processed filtrate, now more concentrated, flows into collecting ducts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>. These ducts also descend back into the salty renal medulla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>. The permeability of these ducts to water can be regulated by hormones (e.g., anti-diuretic hormone), allowing even more water to be reabsorbed into the medulla when needed, thereby concentrating the urine further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. The final urine then leaves the [[kidney_overview_and_function | kidney]] via the ureters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>.

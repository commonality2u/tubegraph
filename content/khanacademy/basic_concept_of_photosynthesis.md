Photosynthesis is one of the most important biological processes on Earth, fundamental for the existence of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Without it, life as we know it would not exist, and food would not be available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. It is primarily associated with plants, but also occurs in bacteria and algae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Overview

In simple terms, [[Detailed Process of Photosynthesis|photosynthesis]] is the process by which plants, along with some bacteria and algae, convert carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight into sugars (carbohydrates) and oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

```
Carbon Dioxide + Water + Sunlight → Carbohydrates (Sugars) + Oxygen
```
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>

## [[Importance of Photosynthesis|Significance for Life]]

Photosynthesis has two profoundly significant aspects for living species, especially those that breathe oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>:
1.  **Carbohydrate Production**: It produces carbohydrates or sugars that are essential to fuel bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. For instance, [[role_of_glucose_in_energy_production|glucose]], a simple carbohydrate, is broken down during [[cellular_respiration_process|cellular respiration]] to generate ATP, the energy currency of the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. These carbohydrates serve as the primary fuel source for animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
2.  **Oxygen Release**: The process releases oxygen, which is crucial for organisms that perform [[cellular_respiration_process|cellular respiration]] to break down glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

Photosynthesis allows organisms to harness the energy from sunlight, converting it into sugar molecules that can be used for energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## General Chemical Equation

A more scientifically specific general equation for photosynthesis involves carbon dioxide, water, and photons (light energy) to produce a carbohydrate and oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. A general way to represent carbohydrates is `CH₂O` with `n` multiples, where `n` is typically at least three, and for [[role_of_glucose_in_energy_production|glucose]], `n` is 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

The balanced general equation is:
```
n CO₂ + n H₂O + Photons → (CH₂O)n + n O₂
```
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>

This equation is a high-level view; the process involves many intermediate steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## Two Stages of Photosynthesis

[[Detailed Process of Photosynthesis|Photosynthesis]] can be broadly divided into two main stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>:

### [[LightDependent and LightIndependent Reactions|Light-Dependent Reactions]]
These reactions require sunlight (photons) to occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
*   **Inputs**: Photons and water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   **Outputs**: Molecular oxygen, ATP (the cellular energy currency), and NADPH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

NADPH is similar to NADH seen in [[cellular_respiration_process|cellular respiration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. It functions as a reducing agent, meaning it can donate a hydrogen atom and its associated electron to another molecule, causing that molecule to be reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. The energy released when these electrons go to a lower energy state is harnessed in the subsequent dark reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

### [[LightDependent and LightIndependent Reactions|Light-Independent Reactions]] (or [[Calvin Cycle and Carbohydrate Production|Calvin Cycle]])
Often misnamed "dark reactions," these reactions do not directly require photons, but they still occur when the sun is out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. They rely on the byproducts (ATP and NADPH) from the light reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
*   **Inputs**: ATP and NADPH (from light reactions), and carbon dioxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
*   **Outputs**: Phosphoglyceraldehyde (PGAL) or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

PGAL/G3P is a three-carbon molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a> and serves as a fundamental building block for other carbohydrates, including [[role_of_glucose_in_energy_production|glucose]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. For example, two PGAL molecules can be used to produce one [[role_of_glucose_in_energy_production|glucose]] molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. This process of building [[role_of_glucose_in_energy_production|glucose]] is the reverse of [[overview_of_glycolysis|glycolysis]], where [[role_of_glucose_in_energy_production|glucose]] is split <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

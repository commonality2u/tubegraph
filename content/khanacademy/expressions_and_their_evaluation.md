When dealing with basic arithmetic, one encounters concrete numbers like 23 plus 5, which immediately yields 28 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Other examples include 2 times 7 or 3 divided by 4, where the exact numbers are known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. As one enters the algebraic world, the concept of variables is introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Understanding Variables

Variables are values within [[mathematical_expressions | expressions]] that are subject to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. For instance, in the [[mathematical_expressions | expression]] `x + 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, its value depends on the value assigned to `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

*   If `x` is 1, then `x + 5` evaluates to 1 + 5, which is 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   If `x` is -7, then `x + 5` evaluates to -7 + 5, which is -2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

The value of `x` (a variable) can change based on the context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Variables are encountered in the context of [[mathematical_expressions | expressions]] and also in equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Expressions vs. Equations

Understanding the [[difference_between_expressions_and_equations | distinction between an expression and an equation]] is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

> An [[mathematical_expressions | expression]] is fundamentally a statement of value or quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Its value varies depending on the values of its variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Examples include `x + 5` or `y + z` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Such [[mathematical_expressions | expressions]] can be [[evaluating_functions | evaluated]] to yield a value based on the specific variable values assigned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

An equation involves setting two [[mathematical_expressions | expressions]] equal to each other, hence the term "equations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

*   For example, `x + 3 = 1` is an equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. In this case, with one equation and one unknown, the value of `x` is constrained to -2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   Another example is `x + y + z = 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Here, `5` is also considered an [[mathematical_expressions | expression]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. While there are constraints, the specific value of each variable might still depend on others. If `y = 3` and `z = 2`, the equation becomes `x + 3 + 2 = 5`, which [[simplifying_expressions | simplifies]] to `x + 5 = 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. This constrains `x` to be 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

Ultimately, the key takeaway is that a variable's value can differ depending on the problem's context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

## Evaluating Expressions

[[Evaluating functions | Evaluating expressions]] means substituting the given values for variables and performing the operations to find a single numerical result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

### Examples of Evaluation

1.  **Expression:** `x^y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>
    *   If `x = 5` and `y = 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>:
        The [[mathematical_expressions | expression]] becomes `5^2`, which [[evaluating_functions | evaluates]] to 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
    *   If `x = -2` and `y = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>:
        The [[mathematical_expressions | expression]] becomes `(-2)^3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. This means -2 multiplied by itself three times (-2 * -2 * -2), which [[evaluating_functions | evaluates]] to -8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

2.  **Complex Expression:** `√(x + y) - x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>
    *   If `x = 1` and `y = 8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>:
        Substitute `x` with 1 and `y` with 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.
        The [[mathematical_expressions | expression]] becomes `√(1 + 8) - 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
        First, evaluate `1 + 8` which is 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
        Next, find the principal (positive) square root of 9, which is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
        Finally, subtract 1: `3 - 1`, which [[evaluating_functions | evaluates]] to 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

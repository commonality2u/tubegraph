The Loop of Henle is considered a highly interesting and crucial component of the [[the_nephron_structure | nephron]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. It constitutes the majority of the [[the_nephron_structure | nephron]]'s length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

## Location and Structure
The Loop of Henle begins after the proximal tubule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. It dips down into the renal [[kidney_anatomy_and_function | medulla]] and then ascends back towards the renal cortex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>, thus crossing the border between the renal cortex and the renal [[kidney_anatomy_and_function | medulla]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. This unique positioning is critical for its function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

## Primary Functions
The Loop of Henle serves two main purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>:
1.  To make the renal [[kidney_anatomy_and_function | medulla]] salty (hypertonic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.
2.  To facilitate significant [[reabsorption_process_in_the_nephron | reabsorption]] of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

## Mechanisms of Operation

### Ascending Loop of Henle
The ascending part of the Loop of Henle is responsible for actively pumping out salts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. These salts include sodium, potassium, and chloride ions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. This process requires energy in the form of ATP, as it pumps against a concentration gradient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. By doing so, it makes the entire renal [[kidney_anatomy_and_function | medulla]] hypertonic (salty) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. Crucially, the ascending part is permeable only to these salts and ions, not to water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.

### Descending Loop of Henle
In contrast to the ascending limb, the descending part of the Loop of Henle is permeable only to water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. As the filtrate descends into the salty (hypertonic) [[kidney_anatomy_and_function | medulla]], water naturally moves out of the tubule and into the surrounding tissue due to [[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | osmosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. This is a major mechanism for [[reabsorption_process_in_the_nephron | reabsorbing]] a significant amount of the water that was initially filtered from the blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. Biological systems effectively use ATP to pump ions, and this strategic creation of a salty environment allows water to follow passively via [[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | osmosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. The length of the Loop of Henle allows sufficient time for this water secretion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> The strategy employed by the Loop of Henle to reabsorb water relies on creating an osmotic gradient rather than actively pumping water, as active water transport is not easily achievable in biological systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.

By the time the filtrate leaves the Loop of Henle, a substantial amount of water has been reabsorbed, and the fluid is more concentrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>.

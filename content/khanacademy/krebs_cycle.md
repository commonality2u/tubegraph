The [[krebs_cycle_and_pyruvate_oxidation | Krebs cycle]], also known as the citric acid cycle, is a subsequent stage in [[introduction_to_cellular_respiration | cellular respiration]] that follows [[glycolysis | glycolysis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. While there is a bit of setup involved, the byproducts from [[glycolysis | glycolysis]] are re-engineered before entering the [[krebs_cycle_and_pyruvate_oxidation | Krebs cycle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

## Role in Cellular Respiration

The [[krebs_cycle_and_pyruvate_oxidation | Krebs cycle]] is one of the three primary phases of [[cellular_respiration_phases | cellular respiration]], with the others being [[glycolysis | glycolysis]] and the [[electron_transport_chain | electron transport chain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Oxygen Requirement

Unlike [[glycolysis | glycolysis]], which is an anaerobic process, the [[krebs_cycle_and_pyruvate_oxidation | Krebs cycle]] is an **aerobic** process, meaning it requires the presence of oxygen to function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

> [!info] Oxygen's Role
> If a cell lacks sufficient oxygen, the byproducts of [[glycolysis_process | glycolysis]] will not proceed into the [[krebs_cycle_and_pyruvate_oxidation | Krebs cycle]] or the [[electron_transport_chain | electron transport chain]]. Instead, they undergo fermentation, producing substances like alcohol (in some organisms like yeast) or lactic acid (in humans) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

## ATP and NADH/FADH Production

The [[krebs_cycle_and_pyruvate_oxidation | Krebs cycle]] directly produces two ATP molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. However, its significant contribution comes from the production of other molecules, primarily NADH and FADH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. These molecules are crucial because they drive the [[electron_transport_chain | electron transport chain]], which is responsible for generating the bulk of the ATP during [[electron_transport_chain_and_atp_production | cellular respiration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. Combined with [[glycolysis | glycolysis]], the processes leading up to the [[electron_transport_chain | Electron Transport Chain]] (including the [[krebs_cycle_and_pyruvate_oxidation | Krebs cycle]]) produce a total of 10 NADHs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.

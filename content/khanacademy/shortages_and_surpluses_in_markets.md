This article explores the concepts of shortages and surpluses within a market, using the [[apple_market_supply_and_demand | apple market]] as an example. It also demonstrates how these situations naturally lead to [[market_equilibrium_and_equilibrium_price | market equilibrium]].

## Setting up the Market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>

In the context of the [[apple_market_supply_and_demand | apple market]], a graph is used to illustrate demand and supply at different prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.
*   The vertical axis represents the price per pound of apples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
*   The horizontal axis represents the quantity of apples in thousands of pounds, typically for a set period like the next week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

The market exhibits typical [[understanding_demand_curve | demand]] and [[understanding_supply_curve | supply]] curves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>:
*   **Demand Curve**: As the price of apples increases, the [[impact_of_price_changes_on_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] by consumers decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. For example, at $5 a pound, [[impact_of_price_changes_on_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] might be 500 pounds, while at $1 a pound, it might be 4,000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. The term "demand" refers to the entire relationship between price and quantity, whereas "[[impact_of_price_changes_on_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]]" is a specific quantity at a given price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Supply Curve**: Producers are typically willing to supply more apples as the price increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. There's a minimum price below which producers are not willing to supply apples, for instance, 50 cents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

## Shortage Scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>

Consider a scenario where apple suppliers anticipate selling apples at $1 per pound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   At $1 per pound, the [[impact_of_price_changes_on_quantity_demanded | quantity supplied]] by producers is 1,000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   However, the [[impact_of_price_changes_on_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] by consumers at this price is 4,000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

This situation results in a **shortage** of 3,000 pounds of apples (4,000 demanded - 1,000 supplied) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

### Market Reaction to a Shortage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>

When a shortage occurs:
1.  **Price Increase**: Consumers will bid up the price of the limited apples available because they want them so badly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
2.  **Increased Quantity Supplied**: As prices rise, producers will be incentivized to increase the [[impact_of_price_changes_on_quantity_demanded | quantity supplied]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. They move along the supply curve to higher prices and quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
3.  **Decreased Quantity Demanded**: As prices rise, consumers will reduce their [[impact_of_price_changes_on_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. They move along the demand curve to higher prices and lower quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

This adjustment reduces the severity of the shortage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

## Surplus Scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>

Consider a scenario where suppliers, reacting to previous demand, set the price at $3 per pound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   At $3 per pound, the [[impact_of_price_changes_on_quantity_demanded | quantity supplied]] by producers is 3,000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   However, the [[impact_of_price_changes_on_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] by consumers at this higher price is only 1,300 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

This results in a **surplus** of 1,700 pounds of apples (3,000 supplied - 1,300 demanded) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

### Market Reaction to a Surplus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>

When a surplus occurs:
1.  **Price Decrease**: Since apples won't last forever, producers become desperate to sell and start reducing prices to attract consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
2.  **Decreased Quantity Supplied**: As prices fall, producers will reduce the [[impact_of_price_changes_on_quantity_demanded | quantity supplied]] because it's less profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. They move along the supply curve to lower prices and quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
3.  **Increased Quantity Demanded**: As prices fall, consumers will increase their [[impact_of_price_changes_on_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. They move along the demand curve to lower prices and higher quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

## Market Equilibrium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>

Both shortages and surpluses create market pressures that push prices and quantities towards a single point where the [[understanding_demand_curve | demand]] and [[understanding_supply_curve | supply]] curves intersect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

This intersection point represents the [[market_equilibrium_and_equilibrium_price | market equilibrium]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>:
*   **[[market_equilibrium_and_equilibrium_price | Equilibrium Price]]**: The price at which the [[impact_of_price_changes_on_quantity_demanded | quantity supplied]] equals the [[impact_of_price_changes_on_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. In the apple example, this is approximately $2.15 per pound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
*   **Equilibrium Quantity**: The quantity at which the [[impact_of_price_changes_on_quantity_demanded | quantity supplied]] equals the [[impact_of_price_changes_on_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. For the apple example, this is around 2,200 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

At [[market_equilibrium_and_equilibrium_price | equilibrium]], both consumers and producers are satisfied: all apples produced are sold, and none go bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. This represents a stable scenario, assuming no other market factors change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

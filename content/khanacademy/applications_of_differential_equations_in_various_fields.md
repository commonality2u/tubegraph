[[introduction_to_differential_equations | Differential equations]] are a widely applicable area of study, showing up in a variety of fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. They are a "fairly useful thing" due to their prevalence across different disciplines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

Some of the fields where [[introduction_to_differential_equations | differential equations]] are utilized include:
*   Economics (e.g., for PhD programs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>
*   Physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>
*   Engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>

## [[Definition and Basic Understanding of Differential Equations | What is a Differential Equation?]]

A [[definition_and_basic_understanding_of_differential_equations | differential equation]] is defined as an equation that involves an unknown function and its [[understanding_derivatives_in_differential_equations | derivatives]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

Examples of ways to write the same [[definition_and_basic_understanding_of_differential_equations | differential equation]] include:
*   `y' + y = x + 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>
*   `dy/dx + y = x + 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>
*   `f'(x) + f(x) = x + 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>

In these examples, the unknown function is `y` or `f(x)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## [[Solutions to differential equations | Solutions to Differential Equations]]

A key distinction between [[solutions_to_differential_equations | differential equations]] and regular algebraic equations is the nature of their [[solutions_to_differential_equations | solutions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   For a regular equation (e.g., `x² + cos(x) = √x`), the [[solutions_to_differential_equations | solution]] is a number or a set of numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   For a [[solutions_to_differential_equations | differential equation]], the [[solutions_to_differential_equations | solution]] is a function or a class of functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. The goal is to find the function `y(x)` or `f(x)` that satisfies the given equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

### [[Examples of differential equation solutions | Verifying Solutions]]
Consider the [[definition_and_basic_understanding_of_differential_equations | differential equation]]: `y'' + 2y' - 3y = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

One claimed [[solutions_to_differential_equations | solution]] is `y₁(x) = e⁻³ˣ` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
To verify, its [[understanding_derivatives_in_differential_equations | derivatives]] are:
*   `y₁' = -3e⁻³ˣ` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>
*   `y₁'' = 9e⁻³ˣ` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>

Substituting these into the equation:
`9e⁻³ˣ + 2(-3e⁻³ˣ) - 3(e⁻³ˣ)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>
`= 9e⁻³ˣ - 6e⁻³ˣ - 3e⁻³ˣ` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>
`= 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>
This confirms `y₁(x) = e⁻³ˣ` is a [[solutions_to_differential_equations | solution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

Another claimed [[solutions_to_differential_equations | solution]] for the same equation is `y₂(x) = eˣ` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
Its [[understanding_derivatives_in_differential_equations | derivatives]] are also `y₂' = eˣ` and `y₂'' = eˣ` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
Substituting these into the equation:
`eˣ + 2(eˣ) - 3(eˣ)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>
`= eˣ + 2eˣ - 3eˣ` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>
`= 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>
This also confirms `y₂(x) = eˣ` is a [[solutions_to_differential_equations | solution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

## [[Classification of Differential Equations | Classification of Differential Equations]]

[[classification_of_differential_equations | Differential equations]] can be classified in several ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

### Ordinary vs. Partial Differential Equations
*   **Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE)**: Involves a function of only one independent variable and its [[understanding_derivatives_in_differential_equations | derivatives]] with respect to that single variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. This article focuses on ODEs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
*   **Partial Differential Equation (PDE)**: Involves a function of more than one variable, with [[understanding_derivatives_in_differential_equations | derivatives]] taken with respect to multiple independent variables (e.g., x, y, z) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

### Order of a Differential Equation
The order of a [[definition_and_basic_understanding_of_differential_equations | differential equation]] is determined by the highest [[understanding_derivatives_in_differential_equations | derivative]] of the unknown function present in the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.
*   For example, in `x²y'' + xy' + 2y = sin(x)`, the highest [[understanding_derivatives_in_differential_equations | derivative]] is the second [[understanding_derivatives_in_differential_equations | derivative]] (`y''`), making it a second-order [[definition_and_basic_understanding_of_differential_equations | differential equation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

### [[Linear and Nonlinear Differential Equations | Linear vs. Non-linear Differential Equations]]
A [[linear_and_nonlinear_differential_equations | differential equation]] is considered [[linear_and_nonlinear_differential_equations | linear]] if all terms involving the unknown function and its [[understanding_derivatives_in_differential_equations | derivatives]] are themselves "linear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. This means:
*   The function or its [[understanding_derivatives_in_differential_equations | derivatives]] are not raised to a power (e.g., no `y²` or `(dy/dx)²`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
*   The function and its [[understanding_derivatives_in_differential_equations | derivatives]] are not multiplied by each other (e.g., no `y * y''`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

*   **[[Linear and Nonlinear Differential Equations | Linear Example]]**: `x²y'' + xy' + 2y = sin(x)` is [[linear_and_nonlinear_differential_equations | linear]] because `y''`, `y'`, and `y` are not multiplied by each other or raised to powers, even though they are multiplied by the independent variable `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
*   **[[Linear and Nonlinear Differential Equations | Non-linear Example]]**:
    *   `x²(d²y/dx²)² = sin(x)` is [[linear_and_nonlinear_differential_equations | non-linear]] because the second [[understanding_derivatives_in_differential_equations | derivative]] term is squared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
    *   `y * (d²y/dx²) = sin(x)` is also [[linear_and_nonlinear_differential_equations | non-linear]] because the function `y` is multiplied by its second [[understanding_derivatives_in_differential_equations | derivative]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

[[understanding_the_concept_of_slope | Slope]] indicates how [[Slope of a Straight Line | steep a line is]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The fundamental way to define [[Slope of a line in algebra | slope]] is as the ratio of the "change in y" to the "change in x" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This relationship can be written as:

```
Slope = Change in y / Change in x
```
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>

For any given line, the [[consistency in calculating slope | slope]] will always remain constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The "change in" concept is often represented by the capital Greek letter delta (Δ), so the formula can also be seen as Δy / Δx <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Calculating Slope from a Graph

To find the slope of a line from a graph, you can pick any two points on the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. It is often easiest to select points with integer coordinates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

### Example 1: Moving Rightward

Let's consider a line where we pick a starting point and a second point to the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

1.  **Identify Change in X (Δx):**
    *   Starting at an x-coordinate of -3 and moving to an x-coordinate of 0, the horizontal change (Δx) is 3 units to the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
    *   Δx = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>

2.  **Identify Change in Y (Δy):**
    *   From a y-coordinate of -3, moving up to a y-coordinate of -1, the vertical change (Δy) is 2 units up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
    *   Δy = 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>

3.  **Calculate Slope:**
    *   Slope = Δy / Δx = 2 / 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>

### Example 2: [[using_different_points_to_determine_slope | Using Different Points and Directions]]

The choice of points and direction of travel along the line does not change the slope, as long as consistency is maintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

Consider starting at a point further right and moving to a point further left:

1.  **Identify Change in Y (Δy):**
    *   Starting at a y-coordinate of 1 and moving down to a y-coordinate of -3, the vertical change is -4 units (down) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
    *   Δy = -4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>

2.  **Identify Change in X (Δx):**
    *   Starting at an x-coordinate of 3 and moving to an x-coordinate of -3, the horizontal change is -6 units (left) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
    *   Δx = -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>

3.  **Calculate Slope:**
    *   Slope = Δy / Δx = -4 / -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>
    *   The negatives cancel out, resulting in 4/6, which simplifies to 2/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

Regardless of the points chosen or the direction of measurement, the slope of a straight line will always be the same value, provided the calculations for Δy and Δx are [[consistency in calculating slope | consistent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

The [[understanding_slope_of_a_straight_line | slope of a line]] indicates how steep it is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. For a straight line, its slope is always constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Formula for Slope
The slope is defined as the change in y divided by the change in x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This can be written as:

$ \text{Slope} = \frac{\text{Change in y}}{\text{Change in x}} $ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>

### Notation
The symbol "Î”" (Delta), which is a capital delta, means "change in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Therefore, the formula for slope is often expressed as:

$ \text{Slope} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} $ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>

## Steps to [[determining_slope | Determine Slope]] from a Graph
To find the [[slope_of_a_line_in_algebra | slope of a line]] using a graph, follow these steps:

1.  **Select Two Points**: Choose any two distinct points on the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. It is advisable to pick points with clear integer coordinates for easier reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
2.  **Calculate Change in X ($\Delta x$)**: Determine the horizontal distance between the two chosen points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
3.  **Calculate Change in Y ($\Delta y$)**: Determine the vertical distance between the two chosen points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
4.  **Calculate Slope**: Divide the change in y by the change in x ($ \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} $) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## Example 1: Moving from Left to Right
Let's consider a line passing through the points (-3, -3) and (0, -1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

1.  **Change in X ($\Delta x$)**: Starting at x = -3 and moving to x = 0, the change in x is 3 units to the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
    *   $\Delta x = 0 - (-3) = 3$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>
2.  **Change in Y ($\Delta y$)**: Starting at y = -3 and moving to y = -1, the change in y is 2 units upwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
    *   $\Delta y = -1 - (-3) = 2$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>
3.  **Slope**:
    *   $\text{Slope} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{2}{3}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>

## Example 2: Verifying with Different Points and Direction
The slope of a line is constant, so you can pick any two points on the line and get the same result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Let's use the points (3, 1) and (-3, -3) from the same line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

1.  **Change in Y ($\Delta y$)**: Starting at y = 1 and moving to y = -3, the change in y is 4 units downwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
    *   $\Delta y = -3 - 1 = -4$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>
2.  **Change in X ($\Delta x$)**: Starting at x = 3 and moving to x = -3, the change in x is 6 units to the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
    *   $\Delta x = -3 - 3 = -6$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>
3.  **Slope**:
    *   $\text{Slope} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{-4}{-6}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>
    *   Simplifying the fraction, the negatives cancel out, and 4/6 reduces to 2/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
    *   $\text{Slope} = \frac{2}{3}$

Both examples yield the same slope of 2/3, demonstrating that the choice of points does not affect the slope value as long as consistency is maintained in calculating changes in x and y <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

The immune system is broadly categorized into two main types: the nonspecific (or [[innate_immune_system_and_its_components | innate immune system]]) and the specific (or adaptive) immune system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The [[difference_between_innate_and_adaptive_immune_systems | difference between innate and adaptive immune systems]] lies in their specificity and ability to adapt.

## The Nonspecific (Innate) Immune System

The [[innate_immune_system_and_its_components | innate immune system]] acts as the body's first line of defense.
*   **First Line Barriers** These are natural physical and chemical barriers that prevent pathogens from entering the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Examples include:
    *   Skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>
    *   Stomach acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>
    *   Acidity of oils on the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>
*   **Second Line Defense** Once pathogens bypass the first line, the second line of defense engages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This response is still nonspecific, meaning it doesn't identify the specific type of virus, protein, or bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. It recognizes general "shady" characteristics, such as double-stranded DNA found in viruses, and acts to neutralize the threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
    *   [[cellular_mechanisms_of_inflammation | Inflammatory Response]]: A key component that helps direct immune cells to the site of infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
    *   [[role_of_phagocytes_in_the_immune_response | Phagocytes]]: These are cells that engulf and destroy foreign invaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
        *   Examples include [[role_of_mast_cells_and_dendritic_cells | dendritic cells]], macrophages, and neutrophils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
        *   All [[role_of_phagocytes_in_the_immune_response | phagocytes]] are types of white blood cells, also known as leukocytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## The Specific (Adaptive) Immune System

The specific or adaptive immune system is considered a newer adaptation in organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. It is unique in its ability to develop resistance based on prior exposure to specific pathogens, leading to a more targeted and efficient response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

The main actors in the specific immune system are [[functions_of_lymphocytes_b_and_t_cells | lymphocytes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. [[functions_of_lymphocytes_b_and_t_cells | Lymphocytes]] are a specific type of white blood cell (leukocyte) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

### Types of Lymphocytes

*   **[[functions_of_lymphocytes_b_and_t_cells | B lymphocytes]] (B cells)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>:
    *   Named "B" because they were first recognized in the bursa of Fabricius in birds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
    *   In humans, [[functions_of_lymphocytes_b_and_t_cells | B cells]] are produced and developed in the bone marrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **[[functions_of_lymphocytes_b_and_t_cells | T lymphocytes]] (T cells)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>:
    *   Named "T" because they start in the bone marrow but mature in the thymus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
    *   Classes of T lymphocytes include helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

### Humoral Response vs. Cell-Mediated Response

The adaptive immune system is further divided into two major types of responses:

*   **Humoral Response**
    *   Mainly carried out by [[functions_of_lymphocytes_b_and_t_cells | B lymphocytes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
    *   It is effective against pathogens (like viruses or bacteria) that are freely floating in the body's fluids ("humoral fluids") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
    *   Helper T cells play a significant role in activating and amplifying the humoral response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

*   **Cell-Mediated Response**
    *   Mainly carried out by [[functions_of_lymphocytes_b_and_t_cells | T lymphocytes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
    *   This response targets cells that have already been infiltrated or infected by pathogens, such as viruses or bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
    *   Instead of dealing with free-floating pathogens, the cell-mediated response focuses on identifying and eliminating the infected host cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

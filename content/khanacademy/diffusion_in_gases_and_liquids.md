## Basic Definitions

Before discussing diffusion, it's helpful to understand some basic terms related to solutions:

*   **[[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | Solvent]]**
    The substance in a solution that is present in a greater quantity, typically viewed as the substance that "does the dissolving" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. For example, in a mixture of sugar and [[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | water molecules]], [[basic_concepts_of_solvent_of_and_solute | water]] is the [[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | solvent]] because there are many more [[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | water molecules]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. While water is a very common [[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | solvent]], others can include alcohol or mercury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
*   **[[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | Solute]]**
    The substance in a solution that is present in a lesser quantity and is dissolved by the [[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | solvent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. In the example above, [[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | sugar molecules]] would be the [[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | solute]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Solution**
    The combination of a [[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | solvent]] and a [[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | solute]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

## Understanding Diffusion

[[interaction_and_behavior_of_atoms | Particles]] or [[interaction_and_behavior_of_atoms | molecules]] are constantly moving in random directions due to their kinetic energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. This random movement leads to the phenomenon of diffusion.

Diffusion is the spreading of [[interaction_and_behavior_of_atoms | particles]] or [[interaction_and_behavior_of_atoms | molecules]] from an area of high [[concentration_gradients_and_equilibrium | concentration]] to an area of low [[concentration_gradients_and_equilibrium | concentration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. The system naturally moves towards a state of [[concentration_gradients_and_equilibrium | equilibrium]], where [[interaction_and_behavior_of_atoms | particles]] are relatively spread out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.

### Diffusion in Gases
Consider a container with gaseous oxygen [[interaction_and_behavior_of_atoms | molecules]] initially confined to one side, leaving the other side as a vacuum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. These [[interaction_and_behavior_of_atoms | molecules]] are moving randomly and bumping into each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. Over time, because there are more empty spaces to move into on the vacuum side, the [[interaction_and_behavior_of_atoms | molecules]] are more likely to move towards that side, eventually spreading out to fill the entire container <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

### Concentration Explained
[[concentration_gradients_and_equilibrium | Concentration]] refers to how much of a particular [[interaction_and_behavior_of_atoms | particle]] is present per unit of space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>. An area with many [[interaction_and_behavior_of_atoms | particles]] per unit space has a high [[concentration_gradients_and_equilibrium | concentration]], while an area with few [[interaction_and_behavior_of_atoms | particles]] has a low [[concentration_gradients_and_equilibrium | concentration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. Diffusion always involves movement from high to low [[concentration_gradients_and_equilibrium | concentration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.

### Diffusion in Liquids
The principle of diffusion also applies to liquids. Imagine two containers of [[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | water]] connected by a passage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>. If [[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | sugar molecules]] (solute) are added only to the left-hand side, creating a high [[concentration_gradients_and_equilibrium | concentration]] of sugar there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. The [[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | sugar molecules]] will randomly bounce around and eventually pass through the connection to the right-hand side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>. Over time, these [[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | particles]] will spread out until their [[concentration_gradients_and_equilibrium | concentrations]] are roughly equal on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>.

### Related Terminology
When comparing two solutions:
*   **Hypertonic solution**
    A solution with a higher [[concentration_gradients_and_equilibrium | concentration]] of [[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | solute]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>. The prefix "hyper-" means having a lot or too much of something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>.
*   **Hypotonic solution**
    A solution with a lower [[concentration_gradients_and_equilibrium | concentration]] of [[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | solute]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>. The prefix "hypo-" indicates not enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>.

In general, diffusion causes [[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | solute]] to move from a hypertonic solution to a hypotonic solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>.

## Diffusion vs. [[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | Osmosis]]

Diffusion is the general idea of any [[interaction_and_behavior_of_atoms | particle]] spreading from a high [[concentration_gradients_and_equilibrium | concentration]] to a low [[concentration_gradients_and_equilibrium | concentration]] area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:25:00">[18:25:00]</a>.

[[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | Osmosis]], on the other hand, is a specific type of diffusion:
*   It is the diffusion of [[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | water]] (or any [[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | solvent]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:08:00">[17:08:00]</a>.
*   It typically occurs across a [[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | semi-permeable membrane]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:12:00">[17:12:00]</a>. This membrane allows the [[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | solvent]] (e.g., [[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | water]]) to pass through but blocks the [[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | solute]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13:00]</a>.
*   In [[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | osmosis]], [[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | water]] flows from an area where the [[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | solute]] [[concentration_gradients_and_equilibrium | concentration]] is lower (hypotonic) to an area where the [[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | solute]] [[concentration_gradients_and_equilibrium | concentration]] is higher (hypertonic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:51:00">[15:51:00]</a>. This movement helps to equalize the [[concentration_gradients_and_equilibrium | concentration]] of the [[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | solute]] on both sides, even though the [[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | solute]] itself cannot move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:29:00">[17:29:00]</a>.

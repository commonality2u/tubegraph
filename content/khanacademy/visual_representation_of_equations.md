Equations can be visualized using objects to represent variables and constants, making the process of solving them more tangible. This method demonstrates how operations performed on one side of an equation must also be performed on the other side to maintain equality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Solving `3x + 5 = 17`

To solve the equation `3x + 5 = 17`, it can be broken down visually:
*   `3x` is represented as three individual 'x' objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   `+ 5` is represented as five individual '1' objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   The right side, `17`, is represented by seventeen individual '1' objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

### Step 1: Isolating the Variable Term

The goal is to isolate the `3x` term on the left side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   **Visual Method**: To eliminate the `+ 5`, physically remove five objects from the left side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. To maintain equality, five objects must also be removed from the right side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   **Symbolic Method**: This action is equivalent to subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>:
    `3x + 5 - 5 = 17 - 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>
    This simplifies to `3x = 12` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Visually, 12 objects remain on the right side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

### Step 2: Solving for the Variable

Now that the equation is simplified to `3x = 12`, the next step is to find the value of a single 'x'.
*   **Visual Method**: Divide the `3x` into three equal groups, each containing one 'x' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Similarly, divide the 12 objects on the right into three equal groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Each group on the right contains 4 objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Symbolic Method**: This is equivalent to dividing both sides of the equation by 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>:
    `3x / 3 = 12 / 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>
    This yields `x = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, which matches the visual representation where each 'x' corresponds to 4 objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## Solving `7x - 2 = -10`

The same principles apply when dealing with negative numbers, although [[visualizing_multiplication_in_equations | visual representation]] with physical objects becomes more complex.

### Step 1: Isolating the Variable Term

To isolate `7x` on the left side, the `-2` must be eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
*   Add 2 to both sides of the equation to cancel out the `-2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>:
    `7x - 2 + 2 = -10 + 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>
*   This simplifies to `7x = -8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
    *   Remember that adding a positive number to a negative number means moving to the right on a number line. Starting at -10 and adding 2 brings you to -8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

### Step 2: Solving for the Variable

With `7x = -8`, the final step is to find 'x'.
*   Divide both sides of the equation by 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>:
    `7x / 7 = -8 / 7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>
*   This results in `x = -8/7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. This can also be expressed as a mixed number: `x = -1 1/7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

Both examples illustrate the core principle of solving equations: perform the same operation on both sides to maintain equality and isolate the variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

[[basic_overview_of_probability | Probability]] is a fundamental concept in statistics that measures the likelihood of an event occurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. It is a way of quantifying how probable something is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Core Terminology

To understand [[basic_concepts_in_probability_and_statistics | basic concepts in probability]], several key terms are important:

*   **Event**
    The "event" refers to the specific outcome or condition you are interested in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. For example, if you are picking a marble from a bag, the event might be "picking a yellow marble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.
*   **Trial**
    A "trial" is the action or process that results in an outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. In the context of picking marbles, picking a marble out of a bag constitutes a trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   **Possible Outcomes**
    "Possible outcomes" are all the different results that could occur from a trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   **Sample Space**
    The "sample space" is the complete set of all possible outcomes for a given trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This is sometimes considered the "number of possible outcomes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## [[calculating_probability_of_an_event | Calculating Probability of an Event]]

The general approach to [[concept_of_a_fair_coin_and_calculating_probability | calculating probability]] is to determine the ratio of outcomes that meet the desired criteria (the event) to the total number of possible outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

$$ P(\text{Event}) = \frac{\text{Number of outcomes satisfying the event}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} $$

### [[understanding_probability_through_marbles_example | Understanding probability through marbles example]]

Consider a bag containing marbles of different colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>:
*   3 yellow marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>
*   2 red marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>
*   2 green marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>
*   1 blue marble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>

To find the probability of pulling a yellow marble:

1.  **Identify the event:** Picking a yellow marble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.
    *   Number of outcomes satisfying the event: There are 3 yellow marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

2.  **Determine the sample space (total possible outcomes):** Count all the marbles in the bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
    *   3 (yellow) + 2 (red) + 2 (green) + 1 (blue) = 8 total marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
    *   There are 8 possible things that can happen when picking a marble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

3.  **Calculate the probability:**
    *   P(Yellow Marble) = (Number of yellow marbles) / (Total number of marbles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>
    *   P(Yellow Marble) = 3 / 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>

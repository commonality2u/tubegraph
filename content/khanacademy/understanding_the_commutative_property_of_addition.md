The commutative property of addition is a fundamental concept in [[introduction_to_basic_addition | basic addition]] that demonstrates how the order of numbers in an addition problem does not change the sum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. This property is applicable to any two numbers being added together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

## Demonstrating the Commutative Property

The concept can be illustrated with a simple example:

### Using a Number Line
Consider the problem `5 + 6`:
*   Start at the number 5 on a number line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
*   Move 6 units to the right (add 6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   This lands you at the number 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   Thus, 5 plus 6 equals 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

Now, consider the problem `6 + 5`:
*   Start at the number 6 on the same number line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   Move 5 units to the right (add 5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   You will arrive at the same place, the number 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
*   Therefore, 6 plus 5 also equals 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

This shows that `5 + 6` is the same as `6 + 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

### Using Real-World Objects
The commutative property can also be understood using physical objects:
*   If you have 5 avocados and someone gives you 6 more, you will have a total of 11 avocados <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   Conversely, if you start with 6 avocados and someone gives you 5 more, you will still have 11 avocados <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

In both scenarios, the total quantity remains the same, regardless of which group was present first or added second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

This principle extends to all addition problems, confirming that the order of the numbers does not affect the sum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Mastering this concept, along with other foundational mathematical ideas, will become second nature with practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. While [[understanding_basic_multiplication | multiplication]] will be introduced later, [[introduction_to_basic_addition | basic addition]] problems, especially initially, benefit from consistent practice and memorization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

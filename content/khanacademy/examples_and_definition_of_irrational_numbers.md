## Definition of Irrational Numbers

An [[characteristics_and_abundance_of_irrational_numbers | irrational number]] is a number that cannot be represented as the ratio of two integers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. This contrasts with [[definition_of_rational_numbers | rational numbers]], which can always be expressed as such a ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Characteristics

Unlike [[definition_of_rational_numbers | rational numbers]] which can be expressed as finite non-repeating decimals or [[repeating_decimals_as_rational_numbers | repeating decimals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>, [[characteristics_and_abundance_of_irrational_numbers | irrational numbers]] have decimal representations that:
*   Never terminate (go on forever) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   Never repeat in a pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

## Examples of Irrational Numbers

Some of the most famous numbers in mathematics are [[characteristics_and_abundance_of_irrational_numbers | irrational numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Noteworthy examples include:
*   **Pi (π)**: The ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, Pi never terminates and never repeats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **e (Euler's number)**: This number, often found in continuously compounding interest and complex analysis, also never terminates and never repeats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   **Square root of 2 (√2)**: This is an [[characteristics_and_abundance_of_irrational_numbers | irrational number]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. In general, the square root of any non-perfect square will result in an [[characteristics_and_abundance_of_irrational_numbers | irrational number]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   **Phi (φ)**: Also known as the golden ratio, Phi is an [[characteristics_and_abundance_of_irrational_numbers | irrational number]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

Many numbers that "pop out of nature" are [[characteristics_and_abundance_of_irrational_numbers | irrational]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Abundance of Irrational Numbers

While [[characteristics_and_abundance_of_irrational_numbers | irrational numbers]] may seem exotic, they are not uncommon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. There is always at least one, and in fact an infinite number of, [[characteristics_and_abundance_of_irrational_numbers | irrational numbers]] between any two [[definition_of_rational_numbers | rational numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. This suggests that there are not fewer [[characteristics_and_abundance_of_irrational_numbers | irrational numbers]] than [[definition_of_rational_numbers | rational numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

Furthermore:
*   The sum of an [[characteristics_and_abundance_of_irrational_numbers | irrational number]] and a [[definition_of_rational_numbers | rational number]] will always be [[characteristics_and_abundance_of_irrational_numbers | irrational]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   The product of an [[characteristics_and_abundance_of_irrational_numbers | irrational number]] and a [[definition_of_rational_numbers | rational number]] will also be [[characteristics_and_abundance_of_irrational_numbers | irrational]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

These properties indicate that there are a great many [[characteristics_and_abundance_of_irrational_numbers | irrational numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

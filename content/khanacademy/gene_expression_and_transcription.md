[[DNA and cell function | DNA]]'s double helix structure makes it suitable as the molecular basis of heredity [00:00:00]. This article will explore how [[DNA and cell function | DNA]] functions as the basis of heredity, focusing on a conceptual understanding rather than biochemical details [00:00:18].

## [[DNA structure and replication | DNA Replication]]

For [[DNA and cell function | DNA]] to be the molecular basis of heredity, it must be replicable [00:01:25]. When a cell divides, the new cells need to receive the same genetic material [00:01:31]. The process of [[DNA structure and replication | DNA replication]] involves splitting the two sides of the [[DNA and cell function | DNA]] ladder [00:01:54]. Each separated side can then be used as a template to construct a new complementary side [00:02:41].

For example, if one side of the original [[DNA and cell function | DNA]] has an adenine (A), a new thymine (T) will pair with it on the newly constructed strand [00:03:09]. Similarly, guanine (G) pairs with cytosine (C), and vice-versa [00:03:26]. This allows for the creation of two identical [[DNA and cell function | DNA]] strands from one original molecule [00:02:43]. This process occurs before a cell divides and duplicates itself [00:04:28].

## [[DNA and cell function | DNA]], Chromosome, and Gene

It is important to understand the distinctions between [[DNA and cell function | DNA]], chromosomes, and genes:
*   **[[DNA and cell function | DNA]]** refers to the molecule itself, characterized by its sugar-phosphate backbone, sequence of base pairs, and double helix structure [00:05:17]. A [[DNA and cell function | DNA]] molecule can be tens of millions of base pairs long [00:00:42].
*   **Chromosome** is a [[DNA and cell function | DNA]] molecule packaged together with other molecules and proteins, forming a broader structure [00:05:32].
*   **Gene** is a specific section of [[DNA and cell function | DNA]] that is used to express a certain trait [00:05:42] or to code for a specific type of [[protein_synthesis_and_ribosomes | protein]] [00:05:48]. Genes can range in length from several thousand to millions of base pairs [00:06:17].

## Gene Expression

For [[DNA and cell function | DNA]] information to be useful, it must be expressed to define the organism [00:04:41]. The expression of genes within a [[DNA and cell function | DNA]] molecule primarily involves the creation of [[protein_synthesis_and_ribosomes | proteins]] [00:06:30]. This process relies on [[role_of_rna_in_genetic_processes | RNA]], a molecule related to [[DNA and cell function | DNA]] [00:06:33]. [[role_of_rna_in_genetic_processes | RNA]] stands for ribonucleic acid, similar to [[DNA and cell function | DNA]]'s deoxyribonucleic acid, with a slightly different sugar backbone [00:06:45].

### [[messenger_rna_and_transcription_process | Transcription]]

In cells with nuclei, [[DNA and cell function | DNA]] typically remains in the nucleus, but its information needs to be transmitted outside the nucleus to be expressed [00:07:41]. This is where [[role_of_rna_in_genetic_processes | RNA]] plays a crucial role as a messenger [00:07:50].

The first step in gene expression is [[messenger_rna_and_transcription_process | transcription]], which is the process of going from [[DNA and cell function | DNA]] to [[messenger_rna_and_transcription_process | messenger RNA]] (mRNA) [00:08:04]. Conceptually, [[messenger_rna_and_transcription_process | transcription]] is similar to [[DNA structure and replication | DNA replication]], but instead of creating a new [[DNA and cell function | DNA]] strand, a corresponding mRNA molecule is constructed from a section of the [[DNA and cell function | DNA]] (a gene) [00:09:01].

During [[messenger_rna_and_transcription_process | transcription]], base pairing rules are applied with one key difference for [[role_of_rna_in_genetic_processes | RNA]]:
*   Adenine (A) in [[DNA and cell function | DNA]] pairs with Uracil (U) in [[role_of_rna_in_genetic_processes | RNA]] [00:09:35].
*   Thymine (T) in [[DNA and cell function | DNA]] pairs with Adenine (A) in [[role_of_rna_in_genetic_processes | RNA]] [00:10:09].
*   Guanine (G) in [[DNA and cell function | DNA]] pairs with Cytosine (C) in [[role_of_rna_in_genetic_processes | RNA]] [00:10:16].
*   Cytosine (C) in [[DNA and cell function | DNA]] pairs with Guanine (G) in [[role_of_rna_in_genetic_processes | RNA]] [00:10:20].

Once formed, this single strand of [[messenger_rna_and_transcription_process | messenger RNA]] detaches from the [[DNA and cell function | DNA]] and carries the genetic information outside the nucleus [00:10:27].

### [[translation_and_protein_synthesis | Translation]]

After [[messenger_rna_and_transcription_process | transcription]], the mRNA molecule leaves the nucleus and attaches to a [[protein_synthesis_and_ribosomes | ribosome]] [00:10:41]. The next process, called [[translation_and_protein_synthesis | translation]], converts this base pair sequence into an amino acid sequence [00:11:01]. [[protein_synthesis_and_ribosomes | Proteins]] are made up of sequences of amino acids [00:11:07].

In [[translation_and_protein_synthesis | translation]], each sequence of three bases on the mRNA is called a **codon** [00:12:14]. These three-letter sequences code for a specific amino acid [00:12:08]. With four possible bases (A, U, C, G) and three positions, there are 4 x 4 x 4 = 64 possible codons [00:12:42]. This number is sufficient to code for the 20 known amino acids, with some amino acids being coded by more than one codon [00:12:56].

Another type of [[role_of_rna_in_genetic_processes | RNA]], called [[role_of_rna_in_genetic_processes | transfer RNA]] (tRNA), is responsible for matching the codons on the mRNA to their corresponding amino acids and bringing them to the [[protein_synthesis_and_ribosomes | ribosome]] [00:13:31]. As amino acids are brought together in sequence, they form a [[protein_synthesis_and_ribosomes | protein]] [00:14:29].

[[protein_synthesis_and_ribosomes | Proteins]] are fundamental molecules that largely "run life" [00:14:42]. They can act as enzymes, provide structural support (like in muscle), and perform various functions [00:14:56]. [[protein_synthesis_and_ribosomes | Proteins]] can be thousands or more amino acids long, forming complex shapes that enable their diverse functions [00:15:03]. This entire process illustrates how life's information is stored and utilized [00:15:15].

From: [[khanacademy]] <br/> 

[[Khan Academy origins and growth | Khan Academy]] is primarily recognized for its extensive collection of educational videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This resource now boasts approximately 2,200 videos covering subjects from [[basic_skills_development | basic arithmetic]] to vector calculus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The site currently serves a million students monthly, who collectively watch between 100,000 and 200,000 videos daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Origins of Video-Based Learning

The concept originated when Salman Khan, then an analyst at a hedge fund in Boston, began remotely tutoring his cousins in New Orleans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. He started uploading videos to YouTube as a supplement for his cousins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Benefits for Learners

The initial feedback from his cousins was telling: they preferred his YouTube lessons to in-person tutoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. This preference highlighted several profound benefits of video-based learning:

*   **Self-Paced Learning** Students can pause and repeat content without feeling they are wasting anyone's time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This allows them to review concepts they might have forgotten from weeks or even years prior without embarrassment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. They can also fast-forward if they are bored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   **Reduced Anxiety** When grappling with a new concept, the presence of another human asking, "Do you understand this?" can be counterproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Video learning allows students to engage with material in the privacy of their own space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Positive Emotional Impact** Users have reported significant positive emotional responses, such as smiling while doing a derivative or experiencing a "natural high and a good mood for the entire day" after understanding previously complex concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   **Accessibility for Diverse Learners** The videos have proved effective for students with specific learning challenges, such as a 12-year-old with autism who struggled with math but grasped concepts like decimals and fractions through Khan Academy videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **[[Lifelong learning | Enduring Content]]** Educational video content, particularly in foundational subjects, can remain relevant indefinitely, potentially helping future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

## Impact on Classrooms: [[Flipping the classroom model | The Flipped Classroom]]

Initially, the videos were not intended for classroom integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. However, teachers began using them to [[flipping_the_classroom_model | flip the classroom]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. In this model:
*   Lectures are assigned as homework through videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
*   Traditional homework is completed in the classroom, allowing teachers to provide direct support and students to interact with peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

This approach uses technology to "humanize the classroom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. By removing the "one size fits all" lecture from the classroom, students can learn at their own pace at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Classroom time then becomes a more interactive and human experience, replacing potentially dehumanizing lectures with opportunities for peer interaction and individualized teacher support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. This dramatically increases the "student to valuable human time with the teacher" ratio, shifting teacher time from lecturing and grading to directly assisting students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.

## Mastery-Based Learning

The Khan Academy model emphasizes mastery through interactive exercises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. The core paradigm is to provide as many questions as needed until a student achieves 10 correct answers in a row on a concept before moving on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. This contrasts sharply with traditional classroom models where students move on after a snapshot exam, even if they only scored 70-95% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. This traditional approach often leads to "Swiss cheese gaps" in foundational knowledge, causing students to struggle with more advanced topics despite being intelligent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

The Khan Academy system encourages experimentation and failure on the path to mastery, unlike traditional models that penalize it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. All concepts are integrated into a "knowledge map," starting from basic single-digit addition and progressing to advanced topics like algebra, precalculus, logic, computer programming, grammar, and genetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

## Data-Driven Insights and Teacher Feedback

In pilot programs, such as in the Los Altos school district, students spend roughly half their math class using Khan Academy software, freeing up time for simulations, games, and hands-on activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. Teachers use a live dashboard that displays student progress:
*   **Green**: Proficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
*   **Blue**: Working on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.
*   **Red**: Stuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

This [[datadriven_education_and_teacher_feedback | data-driven approach]] allows teachers to intervene with struggling students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a> or facilitate [[global_access_to_education_and_peer_tutoring | peer tutoring]] by connecting proficient students with those who are stuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. Teachers can access granular data, including how long students spend on tasks, what videos they watch, when they pause, and specific problems they got right or wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. This level of insight allows teachers to make interactions as productive as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.

This self-paced learning model reveals that students who might initially appear "slow" often race ahead once they master foundational concepts, challenging traditional labels of "gifted" or "slow" learners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

## Global Reach and Future Vision

The goal is to use technology to humanize education globally, not just in affluent districts like Los Altos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. This model offers significant benefits to:
*   **Adult learners** who may be embarrassed to review basic concepts before returning to college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.
*   **Disadvantaged students** in areas like Calcutta, who can learn at their own pace without school attendance barriers or embarrassment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.

The system envisions a [[global_access_to_education_and_peer_tutoring | global, one-world classroom]] where students worldwide can [[global_access_to_education_and_peer_tutoring | peer tutor]] each other, fostering a truly interconnected learning environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.

To further engage learners, the platform incorporates game mechanics such as badges, leaderboards, and energy points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>. Even subtle changes in wording or point allocation for badges can influence the learning behavior of tens of thousands of students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

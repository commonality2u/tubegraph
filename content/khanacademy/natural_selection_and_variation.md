Evolution is considered by many to be the most misunderstood concept in science, and it has become one of the most contentious concepts in popular culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While the word "evolution" in everyday language implies change, the biological concept is often [[Misunderstandings about evolution | misunderstood]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Misconceptions of Evolution

A common visual representation of evolution depicts an ape gradually becoming more upright and eventually turning into a human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This image suggests that apes "changed into" human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Similarly, another misconception involves a cow or horse-like creature stretching its neck to reach fruit at the top of a tree, with subsequent generations developing longer necks and eventually turning into giraffes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

However, this is not what evolution means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Evolution is not an active process where an ape "wants" its offspring to look more human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, nor does [[DNA structure and its role in heredity | DNA]] "know" what is "better" and spontaneously change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Similarly, creatures don't change into giraffes simply because they desire to reach food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

## Defining Natural Selection

The preferred term to understand this process is [[Natural selection and variation | natural selection]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
Natural selection operates on the principle that any population of living organisms will exhibit [[Natural selection and variation | variation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. [[Natural selection and variation | Variation]] refers to the differences within a population, like people having different heights or hair colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. [[Natural selection and variation | Natural selection]] is the process where environmental factors "select for" certain variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Some variations may be insignificant, while others can be crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

## Examples of Natural Selection

### Peppered Moth

A classic example of [[Examples of natural selection  peppered moth | natural selection]] involves the [[Examples of natural selection  peppered moth | peppered moth]] in pre-Industrial Revolution England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. Within the moth population, there was natural [[Natural selection and variation | variation]]; some moths were lighter with more spots, while others were darker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This trait was not particularly important for thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

With the advent of the Industrial Revolution, soot from factories covered tree trunks, turning them dark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. This change in the environment created a new selective pressure: predation by birds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. Lighter moths became more visible against the dark trees, making them easier targets for birds compared to darker moths, which were better camouflaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. As a result, the darker moths reproduced more often, while the lighter moths were eaten before they could produce as many offspring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. Over time, the darker trait became dominant in the population, effectively turning the "peppered moth" into what could be viewed as a "black moth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. This shift occurred not because moths "decided" to become black, but because environmental factors favored the survival and reproduction of darker individuals within the existing [[Natural selection and variation | variation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

### Flu Virus and Resistance

[[Realtime examples of evolution  flu virus and resistance | Real-time examples of evolution]] and [[Realtime examples of evolution  flu virus and resistance | natural selection]] can be observed with the flu virus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. Viruses are simple structures, essentially "little buckets of [[DNA structure and its role in heredity | DNA]] and sometimes RNA" encased in protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. They replicate by injecting their genetic material into host cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

Each year, flu viruses show [[Natural selection and variation | variation]] within their population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Our immune systems learn to recognize and attack specific viral characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. However, viruses constantly change through [[Random and traditional variables | random mutations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. While most viruses might have a certain identifiable feature (e.g., "two dots"), a small number might have a [[Random and traditional variables | random mutation]] (e.g., "one dot" or "three dots") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. Once the human immune system adapts to attack the prevalent form, the mutated variants, which are not recognized, face less competition and can replicate more successfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. This leads to the emergence of a "new flu virus" every year, demonstrating evolution and [[Realtime examples of evolution  flu virus and resistance | natural selection in real time]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

### Antibiotic Resistance in Bacteria

Another [[Realtime examples of evolution  flu virus and resistance | real-time example]] is the development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. Bacteria are living cells that cause infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. Antibiotics are designed to kill them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

Within a large population of bacteria, there is always [[Natural selection and variation | natural variation]], including some individuals that may have a [[Random and traditional variables | random]] difference in their [[DNA structure and its role in heredity | DNA]] that makes them resistant to an antibiotic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>. If antibiotics are used widely, they kill off the non-resistant bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. This removes the competition for the resistant bacteria, allowing them to replicate rapidly and become the dominant strain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. This process results in "superbugs" â€“ bacteria against which previously effective antibiotics are now useless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. Again, this is not a deliberate "design" by the bacteria, but rather a consequence of [[Natural selection and variation | natural selection]] favoring existing [[Natural selection and variation | variations]] that are resistant to the introduced environmental pressure (the antibiotic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

## Conclusion

Understanding [[Natural selection and variation | natural selection]] is fundamental to the study of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. It is a universal concept that would apply even to life on other planets, regardless of their specific biological mechanisms (e.g., whether they have [[DNA structure and its role in heredity | DNA]] or are carbon-based) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. [[Natural selection and variation | Natural selection]] asserts that an environment will select for [[Random and traditional variables | random changes]] that occur within a population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. Over unimaginably long periods, these accumulated changes can lead to significant evolutionary transformations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>.

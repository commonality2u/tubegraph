## Role in Cellular Respiration

The [[overview_of_the_electron_transport_chain | electron transport chain]] is identified as one of the three main phases of [[energy_production_through_cellular_respiration | cellular respiration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>. This process occurs if oxygen is present after the [[overview_of_the_electron_transport_chain | Krebs cycle]] (also known as the [[overview_of_the_electron_transport_chain | citric acid cycle]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.

## ATP Production

The [[electron_transport_chain | electron transport chain]] is where the bulk of [[atp_synthase_function_and_mechanism | ATP]] is actually produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. It utilizes raw materials that are generated during earlier phases of cellular respiration, such as [[atp_production_and_consumption_in_glycolysis | glycolysis]] and the [[overview_of_the_electron_transport_chain | Krebs cycle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

## Role of NADH

[[role_of_nadh_and_fadh2_in_atp_production | NADH]] is a key molecule used in the [[electron_transport_chain | electron transport chain]] to produce [[atp_synthase_function_and_mechanism | ATPs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>. During [[atp_production_and_consumption_in_glycolysis | glycolysis]], NAD+ is reduced to [[role_of_nadh_and_fadh2_in_atp_production | NADH]] by gaining a hydrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. Each [[role_of_nadh_and_fadh2_in_atp_production | NADH]] produced from earlier stages can later be used in the [[electron_transport_chain | electron transport chain]] to produce three [[atp_synthase_function_and_mechanism | ATPs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:00">[12:25:00]</a>.

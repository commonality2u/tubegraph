[[understanding_ratios | Ratios]] are expressions that compare quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. They indicate how much of one quantity there is in relation to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Representing Ratios

Ratios can be expressed in several ways:
*   **Using a colon:** For 10 horses and 5 dogs, the ratio of horses to dogs is 10:5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   **As a fraction:** This same ratio can be written as 10/5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   **Using the word "to":** It can also be written as "10 to 5" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

In all these forms, the first quantity mentioned corresponds to the first number in the ratio, and the second quantity corresponds to the second number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

### Order Matters
The order in which quantities are compared is crucial. The ratio of "horses to dogs" (10:5) is different from the ratio of "dogs to horses" (5:10) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Whatever order is specified for the items, the ratio will follow that exact order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

## [[reducing_ratios_to_simplest_form | Reducing Ratios to Simplest Form]]

Ratios can often be simplified to a more reduced form, similar to [[representation_of_rational_numbers_as_fractions | fractions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
To simplify a ratio, divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor (GCD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

**Example:**
*   A ratio of 10 horses to 5 dogs (10:5) means there are 10 horses for every 5 dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   To simplify 10:5, find the greatest common divisor of 10 and 5, which is 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   Divide both numbers by 5: 10 ÷ 5 = 2, and 5 ÷ 5 = 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   The simplified ratio is 2:1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This means there are 2 horses for every 1 dog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   Similarly, the ratio of dogs to horses, 5:10, reduces to 1:2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

The general convention is to express ratios in their simplest, reduced form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

## [[complex_ratio_problems_involving_multiple_quantities | Ratios with Multiple Quantities]]

Ratios can compare more than two quantities. The same principles of representation and simplification apply.

**Example:**
*   If you have 20 apples, 40 oranges, and 60 strawberries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   The ratio of apples:oranges:strawberries is initially 20:40:60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   To reduce this ratio, find the largest number that divides into all three quantities. In this case, it's 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   Divide each number by 20:
    *   20 ÷ 20 = 1 (apple) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>
    *   40 ÷ 20 = 2 (oranges) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>
    *   60 ÷ 20 = 3 (strawberries) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>
*   The simplified ratio is 1:2:3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. This means for every 1 apple, there are 2 oranges and 3 strawberries.

## [[using_ratios_to_determine_quantities | Using Ratios to Determine Quantities]]

Ratios can also be used to find the actual number of items when the total quantity is known.

**Example 1: Two Quantities**
*   In a classroom, the ratio of boys to girls is 2:3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
*   There are 40 students total in the classroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   To find the number of girls:
    1.  **Sum the ratio parts:** 2 (boys) + 3 (girls) = 5 total parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. This means for every 5 students, there are 2 boys and 3 girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
    2.  **Determine the number of "groups":** Divide the total number of students by the sum of the ratio parts: 40 students ÷ 5 students/group = 8 groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.
    3.  **Calculate the specific quantity:** Multiply the number of groups by the ratio part for girls: 8 groups × 3 girls/group = 24 girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
*   To find the number of boys: 8 groups × 2 boys/group = 16 boys, or 40 total students - 24 girls = 16 boys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

**Example 2: Multiple Quantities**
*   On a farm, the ratio of sheep to chickens to pigs is 2:5:10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   There are 51 animals total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.
*   To find the number of chickens:
    1.  **Sum the ratio parts:** 2 (sheep) + 5 (chickens) + 10 (pigs) = 17 total parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. This means for every 17 animals, there are 2 sheep, 5 chickens, and 10 pigs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
    2.  **Determine the number of "groups":** Divide the total number of animals by the sum of the ratio parts: 51 animals ÷ 17 animals/group = 3 groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.
    3.  **Calculate the specific quantity:** Multiply the number of groups by the ratio part for chickens: 3 groups × 5 chickens/group = 15 chickens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.

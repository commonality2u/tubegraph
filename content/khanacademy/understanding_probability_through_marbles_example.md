[[Basic probability concepts | Probability]] is a measure of the likelihood that an event will occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. It is determined by comparing the number of outcomes that satisfy a specific condition to the total number of possible outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Problem: Picking a Yellow Marble

Consider a bag containing different colored marbles:
*   3 yellow marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>
*   2 red marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>
*   2 green marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>
*   1 blue marble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>

The goal is to find the [[calculating_probability_of_an_event | probability]] of pulling a yellow marble from this bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Components of Probability

### The Event
The "event in question" is defined as picking a yellow marble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This is the specific outcome we are interested in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

### The Sample Space (Possible Outcomes)
The "sample space" refers to the set of all possible outcomes when performing a "trial" (e.g., picking a marble from the bag) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

In this example, the possible individual outcomes are:
*   Yellow Marble 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>
*   Yellow Marble 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>
*   Yellow Marble 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>
*   Red Marble 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>
*   Red Marble 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>
*   Green Marble 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>
*   Green Marble 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>
*   Blue Marble 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>

Adding these together, the total number of possible outcomes is 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. So, there are 8 possibilities for this trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### Favorable Outcomes
These are the outcomes within the sample space that satisfy the defined event (picking a yellow marble) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. In this case, there are 3 yellow marbles, so there are 3 outcomes that satisfy the event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## Calculating the Probability

The [[calculating_probability_of_an_event | probability]] of an event is calculated as:

> `P(Event) = (Number of Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Number of Possible Outcomes)`

For picking a yellow marble:

*   **Number of Favorable Outcomes (yellow marbles):** 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>
*   **Total Number of Possible Outcomes (all marbles):** 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>

Therefore, the [[calculating_probability_of_an_event | probability]] of picking a yellow marble is:
`P(Yellow Marble) = 3 / 8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>

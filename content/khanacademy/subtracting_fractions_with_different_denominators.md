When [[introduction_to_adding_and_subtracting_fractions | adding or subtracting fractions]], if the denominators (the bottom numbers) are different, you cannot directly combine the numerators (the top numbers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. The first step is to convert the fractions so they share a common denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

## How to Subtract Fractions with Different Denominators

The process for [[adding_fractions_with_different_denominators | adding]] and subtracting fractions with different denominators is the same:

1.  **Find a Common Denominator**: Determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators. This will be the common denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. The LCM is the smallest number that is a multiple of both original denominators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
2.  **Convert Fractions**: Rewrite each fraction as an equivalent fraction with the common denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. To do this, multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the same number that makes the denominator equal to the common denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
3.  **Subtract Numerators**: Once both fractions have the same denominator, you can subtract their numerators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. The denominator of the result will be the common denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
4.  **[[simplifying_fractions | Simplify]] (Optional)**: If the resulting fraction can be [[simplifying_fractions | simplified]], reduce it to its lowest terms.

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Subtraction

Let's subtract 1/3 from 1/2: <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>

1.  **Find Common Denominator**: The denominators are 2 and 3. The least common multiple of 2 and 3 is 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
2.  **Convert Fractions**:
    *   To change 1/2 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 6, multiply the numerator and denominator by 3:
        1/2 = (1 * 3) / (2 * 3) = 3/6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>
    *   To change 1/3 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 6, multiply the numerator and denominator by 2:
        1/3 = (1 * 2) / (3 * 2) = 2/6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>
3.  **Subtract Numerators**: Now the problem becomes [[subtracting_fractions_with_the_same_denominator | subtracting fractions with the same denominator]]:
    3/6 - 2/6 = (3 - 2) / 6 = 1/6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>

### Example 2: Subtracting a Whole Number

Let's calculate 1/10 minus 1: <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>

1.  **Find Common Denominator**: The whole number 1 can be written as a fraction. To have a denominator of 10, write 1 as 10/10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
2.  **Subtract Numerators**:
    1/10 - 10/10 = (1 - 10) / 10 = -9/10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>

### Example 3: Subtracting Negative Fractions

Let's calculate -1/9 minus 1/4: <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>

1.  **Find Common Denominator**: The denominators are 9 and 4. The least common multiple of 9 and 4 is 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
2.  **Convert Fractions**:
    *   To change -1/9 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 36, multiply the numerator and denominator by 4:
        -1/9 = (-1 * 4) / (9 * 4) = -4/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>
    *   To change 1/4 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 36, multiply the numerator and denominator by 9:
        1/4 = (1 * 9) / (4 * 9) = 9/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>
3.  **Subtract Numerators**: Now the problem is:
    -4/36 - 9/36 = (-4 - 9) / 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>
    Using rules for [[subtracting_negative_numbers | subtracting negative numbers]], -4 - 9 equals -13.
    So, the result is -13/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

When [[Adding fractions with different denominators | adding or subtracting fractions]] that have different denominators, a key step is to first find a [[Finding a common denominator | common denominator]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This process is similar for both addition and subtraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

## Finding a Common Denominator

To find a [[Finding a common denominator | common denominator]], it is generally best to find the [[Finding a common denominator | least common multiple (LCM)]] of the denominators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. The LCM is the smallest number that is a multiple of both denominators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

Once the [[Finding a common denominator | common denominator]] is found, convert each fraction into an equivalent fraction with this new common denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. This is done by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by the same number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

### Example 1: 1/2 - 1/3

1.  **Identify the denominators:** The denominators are 2 and 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
2.  **Find the Least Common Multiple (LCM):** The LCM of 2 and 3 is 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
3.  **Convert the fractions:**
    *   To change 1/2 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 6, multiply the numerator and denominator by 3:
        1/2 = (1 * 3) / (2 * 3) = 3/6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>
    *   To change 1/3 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 6, multiply the numerator and denominator by 2:
        1/3 = (1 * 2) / (3 * 2) = 2/6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>
4.  **Subtract the numerators:** Once the denominators are the same, [[Subtracting fractions with the same denominator | subtract the numerators]] and keep the common denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
    *   3/6 - 2/6 = (3 - 2) / 6 = 1/6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>

### Example 2: -1/9 - 1/4

1.  **Identify the denominators:** The denominators are 9 and 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
2.  **Find the LCM:** The LCM of 9 and 4 is 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
3.  **Convert the fractions:**
    *   To change -1/9 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 36, multiply the numerator and denominator by 4:
        -1/9 = (-1 * 4) / (9 * 4) = -4/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>
    *   To change 1/4 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 36, multiply the numerator and denominator by 9:
        1/4 = (1 * 9) / (4 * 9) = 9/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>
4.  **Subtract the numerators:**
    *   -4/36 - 9/36 = (-4 - 9) / 36 = -13/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>

## Subtracting Whole Numbers from Fractions

A whole number can be written as a fraction to perform subtraction. For instance, to subtract 1 from 1/10, write 1 as 10/10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

### Example 3: 1/10 - 1

1.  **Rewrite the whole number as a fraction:**
    *   1 can be written as 10/10 to match the denominator of 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
2.  **Subtract the numerators:**
    *   1/10 - 10/10 = (1 - 10) / 10 = -9/10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>

> [!tip]
> Remember that the denominator is the bottom number in a fraction, and the numerator is the top number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

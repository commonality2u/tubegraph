The circle is considered the most [[fundamental_properties_of_circles | fundamental shape]] in our universe, appearing in planetary orbits, wheels, and even on a molecular level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Understanding its [[fundamental_properties_of_circles | properties]] is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Defining the Radius

A circle is defined as all the points that are equidistant from its center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This equal distance from the center out to the edge of the circle is called the [[definition_and_role_of_radius_in_circles | radius]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. By definition, this distance never changes for a given circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. For example, if one [[definition_and_role_of_radius_in_circles | radius]] is 3 centimeters, any other [[definition_and_role_of_radius_in_circles | radius]] of that same circle will also be 3 centimeters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Defining the Diameter

The diameter is the distance across the widest point of the circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. This widest point always passes through the center of the circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. There are multiple places across the circle where one could measure its widest point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Relationship Between Diameter and Radius

The diameter has a straightforward relationship with the [[definition_and_role_of_radius_in_circles | radius]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Since the widest point of a circle (the diameter) passes through the center, it is essentially composed of two radii <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

Therefore, the formula is:
Diameter = 2 × [[definition_and_role_of_radius_in_circles | Radius]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>

### Practical Examples

*   If a circle has a [[definition_and_role_of_radius_in_circles | radius]] of 3 meters, its diameter will be 2 × 3 meters = 6 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
*   If a circle's [[calculating_circumference_and_its_relationship_with_diameter | circumference]] is 10 meters, knowing that [[explaining_the_significance_of_pi_in_circle_calculations | pi]] times the diameter equals the [[calculating_circumference_and_its_relationship_with_diameter | circumference]] (`C = πd`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>, the diameter would be 10/[[explaining_the_significance_of_pi_in_circle_calculations | pi]] meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. Consequently, the [[definition_and_role_of_radius_in_circles | radius]] would be half of that, or 5/[[explaining_the_significance_of_pi_in_circle_calculations | pi]] meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

Understanding this relationship is fundamental for various circle-related calculations, such as determining the [[calculating_circumference_and_its_relationship_with_diameter | circumference]] or area of a circle.

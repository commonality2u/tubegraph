When asked to add fractions that have different denominators, the first step is to ensure both fractions share the same denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. If the denominators are already the same, you can proceed directly to [[adding_fractions_with_the_same_denominator | adding the numerators]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. However, if they are different, they must be converted to equivalent fractions with a [[finding_a_common_denominator | common denominator]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Finding a Common Denominator

To find a [[finding_a_common_denominator | common denominator]], you need to identify a number that both original denominators can divide into evenly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This number is often the [[finding_a_common_denominator | least common multiple]] (LCM) of the denominators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

One method to find the [[finding_a_common_denominator | least common multiple]] is to list multiples of the larger denominator and check if any of them are divisible by the smaller denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

### Example: Adding 4/9 and 11/12

To add 4/9 and 11/12, the denominators are 9 and 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
Let's find the [[finding_a_common_denominator | least common multiple]] of 9 and 12:
*   Multiples of 12:
    *   12 (not divisible by 9)
    *   24 (not divisible by 9)
    *   36 (divisible by 9; 9 × 4 = 36) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>
Thus, 36 is the [[finding_a_common_denominator | common denominator]] for 9 and 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Rewriting Fractions with a Common Denominator

Once the [[finding_a_common_denominator | common denominator]] is found, each original fraction must be rewritten as an equivalent fraction with this new denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. To do this, determine what number you multiplied the original denominator by to get the [[finding_a_common_denominator | common denominator]], and then multiply the numerator by the exact same number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Example (continued):

*   **For 4/9:**
    *   To change 9 to 36, you multiply by 4 (9 × 4 = 36) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
    *   Therefore, multiply the numerator (4) by 4 as well (4 × 4 = 16) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
    *   So, 4/9 becomes 16/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **For 11/12:**
    *   To change 12 to 36, you multiply by 3 (12 × 3 = 36) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
    *   Therefore, multiply the numerator (11) by 3 as well (11 × 3 = 33) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
    *   So, 11/12 becomes 33/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

Now, the problem is rewritten as 16/36 + 33/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## Adding the Fractions

Once the fractions have the same denominator, you can add them by simply adding their numerators while keeping the denominator the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### Example (continued):

*   Add the numerators: 16 + 33 = 49 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   Keep the denominator: 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   The sum is 49/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## Simplifying the Result

The final answer may be an improper fraction (where the numerator is larger than the denominator) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. It's often required to simplify this to a mixed number and check if the fractional part can be further simplified using [[methods_for_simplifying_fractions | methods for simplifying fractions]] like [[finding_common_factors_in_fractions | finding common factors]].

### Example (continued):

*   The result 49/36 is an improper fraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   To convert it to a mixed number, divide the numerator (49) by the denominator (36) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
    *   36 goes into 49 one time (1 × 36 = 36) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
    *   The remainder is 49 - 36 = 13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   So, 49/36 as a mixed number is 1 and 13/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   Check for simplification:
    *   Factors of 13: 1, 13
    *   Factors of 36: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36
    *   There are no common factors other than 1, so 13/36 is in its simplest form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

The final answer is 1 and 13/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

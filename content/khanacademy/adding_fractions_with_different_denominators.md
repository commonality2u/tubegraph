When [[introduction_to_adding_and_subtracting_fractions | adding fractions]], the first step is to check their denominators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. If the denominators are different, you must make them the same before proceeding with the addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Steps for Adding Fractions with Different Denominators

### 1. Find a Common Denominator

To [[finding_a_common_denominator | find a common denominator]], look for a number that both original denominators will divide into <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This number is also known as the least common multiple (LCM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

One method to find the LCM is to list multiples of the larger denominator and see if any are divisible by the smaller denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

> [!Example] Finding the Common Denominator for 4/9 and 11/12
> For the fractions 4/9 and 11/12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>:
> 1.  The denominators are 9 and 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
> 2.  List multiples of 9:
>     *   9 (not divisible by 12) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>
>     *   18 (not divisible by 12) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>
>     *   27 (not divisible by 12) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>
>     *   36 (divisible by 12; 12 × 3 = 36) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>
> 3.  Therefore, 36 is the common denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### 2. Rewrite Fractions with the Common Denominator

Once you have the common denominator, rewrite each fraction so they both have this new denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

*   **For 4/9:** To change 9 into 36, multiply by 4 (9 × 4 = 36) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. To keep the fraction equivalent, you must also multiply the numerator by 4 (4 × 4 = 16) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. So, 4/9 becomes 16/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. (This is equivalent to [[simplifying_fractions | simplifying fractions]] if you were to divide 16/36 by 4/4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>).
*   **For 11/12:** To change 12 into 36, multiply by 3 (12 × 3 = 36) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Likewise, multiply the numerator by 3 (11 × 3 = 33) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. So, 11/12 becomes 33/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

Now the problem is 16/36 + 33/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

### 3. Add the Numerators

With common denominators, you can simply add the numerators and keep the common denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

*   16/36 + 33/36 = (16 + 33) / 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>
*   16 + 33 = 49 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>
*   The sum is 49/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

### 4. Simplify the Result and Convert to a Mixed Number (if needed)

The result 49/36 is an improper fraction because the numerator (49) is larger than the denominator (36) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

To convert an improper fraction to a mixed number, divide the numerator by the denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

*   Divide 49 by 36:
    *   36 goes into 49 one time (1 × 36 = 36) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
    *   The remainder is 49 - 36 = 13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   The mixed number is 1 and 13/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

The fraction 13/36 cannot be [[simplifying_fractions | simplified]] further because 49 is 7 squared (factors: 1, 7, 49) and 36 is not divisible by 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

> 1.  Find the common denominator, which is 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
> 2.  Rewrite the fractions: 4/9 becomes 16/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, and 11/12 becomes 33/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
> 3.  Add the new fractions: 16/36 + 33/36 = 49/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
> 4.  Convert the improper fraction to a mixed number: 49/36 = 1 and 13/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

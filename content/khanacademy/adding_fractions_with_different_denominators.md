When asked to [[basic_arithmetic_operations_in_fraction_addition | add fractions]] that have different denominators, the first step is to ensure both fractions share a common denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. If the denominators are already the same, you can proceed directly to [[adding_fractions_with_same_denominators | adding the numerators]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Steps for Adding Fractions with Different Denominators

1.  **Check Denominators**: Determine if the denominators are the same or different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
2.  **Find a Common Denominator**: If denominators are different, you need to find a number that both original denominators can divide into evenly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This is typically the [[finding_a_common_denominator_for_fractions | least common multiple]] (LCM) of the denominators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
3.  **Rewrite Fractions**: Convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with the common denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. To do this, multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the same number that transforms the original denominator into the common denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
4.  **Add Numerators**: Once both fractions have the same denominator, [[adding_fractions_with_same_denominators | add the numerators]] and keep the common denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
5.  **Simplify and Convert (if necessary)**:
    *   [[simplifying_fractions | Simplify]] the resulting fraction to its simplest form by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
    *   If the result is an [[dealing_with_whole_numbers_in_fraction_calculations | improper fraction]] (where the numerator is larger than the denominator), convert it to a mixed number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### Example: Adding 4/9 and 11/12

Let's add 4/9 and 11/12 and write the answer as a mixed number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

1.  **Check Denominators**: The denominators are 9 and 12, which are different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

2.  **Find a Common Denominator**:
    *   List multiples of 9: 9, 18, 27, **36**, 45... <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>
    *   List multiples of 12: 12, 24, **36**, 48... <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>
    *   The least common multiple is 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

3.  **Rewrite Fractions**:
    *   For 4/9 to become a fraction with a denominator of 36, 9 must be multiplied by 4 (9 * 4 = 36) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Therefore, multiply the numerator by 4 as well: 4 * 4 = 16.
        *   4/9 becomes 16/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
    *   For 11/12 to become a fraction with a denominator of 36, 12 must be multiplied by 3 (12 * 3 = 36) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Therefore, multiply the numerator by 3 as well: 11 * 3 = 33.
        *   11/12 becomes 33/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

4.  **Add Numerators**:
    *   Now add the rewritten fractions: 16/36 + 33/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
    *   Add the numerators (16 + 33 = 49) and keep the denominator (36) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
    *   The result is 49/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

5.  **Simplify and Convert**:
    *   [[simplifying_fractions | Simplify]]: 49 is 7 squared, so its factors are 1, 7, and 49. 36 is not divisible by 7, so 49/36 is already in its simplest form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
    *   Convert to Mixed Number: Since the numerator (49) is larger than the denominator (36), it's an improper fraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
        *   Divide 49 by 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
        *   36 goes into 49 one time (1 * 36 = 36) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
        *   The remainder is 49 - 36 = 13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
        *   The mixed number is 1 and 13/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

The final answer is 1 and 13/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

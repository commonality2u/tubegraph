[[balancing_chemical_equations | Balancing chemical equations]] is a fundamental concept in chemistry that ensures the conservation of mass during a chemical reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It requires a methodical approach, but with practice, it becomes straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## What is a Chemical Equation?

A chemical equation serves as a symbolic representation of a chemical reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. It details the [[understanding_reactants_and_products_in_chemical_reactions | reactants]] (starting materials) and [[understanding_reactants_and_products_in_chemical_reactions | products]] (substances formed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

For example, the reaction of aluminum (Al) with dioxygen (O₂) to form aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) can be written as:
`Al + O₂ → Al₂O₃` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>

The aluminum oxide molecule consists of two aluminum atoms and three oxygen atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Why Balance Chemical Equations?

The core principle behind [[balancing_chemical_equations | balancing chemical equations]] is the law of conservation of atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This law states that atoms cannot be created or destroyed in a chemical reaction; thus, the number of atoms of each element must be the same on both the reactant and product sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

Consider the initial unbalanced equation:
`Al + O₂ → Al₂O₃`

Let's count the atoms on each side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>:
*   **Aluminum (Al):**
    *   Left (reactant side): 1 atom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>
    *   Right (product side): 2 atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>
*   **Oxygen (O):**
    *   Left (reactant side): 2 atoms (in one O₂ molecule) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>
    *   Right (product side): 3 atoms (in one Al₂O₃ molecule) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>

Since the numbers of atoms are not equal on both sides, the equation is unbalanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Steps to Balance the Equation

To balance a chemical equation, you adjust the coefficients (the numbers in front of each chemical formula) until the number of atoms for each element is equal on both sides.

### Step 1: Balance one element at a time

Begin by focusing on one element. For our example, let's start with aluminum.
The right side has two aluminum atoms, while the left side has one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. To balance this, place a coefficient of '2' in front of aluminum on the left side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

`2Al + O₂ → Al₂O₃`

Now, aluminum is balanced (2 Al on left, 2 Al on right) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

### Step 2: Address the next element

Next, consider oxygen. The left side has two oxygen atoms, and the right side has three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
To get three oxygen atoms on the left, you might think of multiplying the O₂ by 1.5 (1.5 × 2 = 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

`2Al + 1.5O₂ → Al₂O₃`

### Step 3: Eliminate Fractional Coefficients

A common convention in chemistry is to avoid fractional or decimal coefficients, as they imply "half molecules," which is not a physical reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. To resolve this, multiply *all* coefficients in the equation by a common whole number that eliminates the fraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

In this case, to eliminate the `1.5`, multiply all coefficients by `2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>:
*   `2Al` becomes `4Al` (2 × 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>
*   `1.5O₂` becomes `3O₂` (1.5 × 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>
*   `1Al₂O₃` becomes `2Al₂O₃` (1 × 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>

The balanced equation is:
`4Al + 3O₂ → 2Al₂O₃`

### Step 4: Verify the Balance

Finally, recount the atoms for each element on both sides of the balanced equation to confirm everything is correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

*   **Aluminum (Al):**
    *   Left: `4` Al atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>
    *   Right: `2` (coefficient) × `2` (atoms in Al₂O₃) = `4` Al atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>
*   **Oxygen (O):**
    *   Left: `3` (coefficient) × `2` (atoms in O₂) = `6` O atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>
    *   Right: `2` (coefficient) × `3` (atoms in Al₂O₃) = `6` O atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>

Since all atom counts are equal on both sides, the equation is now balanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

[[Definition of Trigonometry|Trigonometry]] is fundamentally the study of the ratios of sides in triangles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The word "trig" means triangle, and "metry" means measure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. A key component of [[Introduction to basic trigonometric functions|basic trigonometry]] involves understanding and remembering the definitions of its [[Core trigonometric functions sine cosine and tangent|core functions]]: sine, cosine, and tangent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Introducing SOH CAH TOA

To help remember the definitions of these functions, a widely used [[SOHCAHTOA Mnemonic|mnemonic device]] is "**SOH CAH TOA**" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. This mnemonic specifies the ratios of certain sides for any given angle within a right triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

The parts of the mnemonic break down as follows:
*   **SOH**: **S**ine is **O**pposite over **H**ypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>
*   **CAH**: **C**osine is **A**djacent over **H**ypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>
*   **TOA**: **T**angent is **O**pposite over **A**djacent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>

### Key Terms in a Right Triangle

A right triangle contains one 90-degree angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. In such a triangle:
*   **Hypotenuse**: This is the side opposite the right angle and is always the longest side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Opposite Side**: The side directly across from the angle in question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   **Adjacent Side**: The side next to the angle in question that is not the hypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

The identification of the "opposite" and "adjacent" sides depends entirely on which acute angle of the triangle is being considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

## Application of SOH CAH TOA

Consider a right triangle with sides of lengths 3, 4, and a hypotenuse of 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This triangle satisfies the Pythagorean theorem (3² + 4² = 5²) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### Example 1: Angle Theta (θ)

Let's find the [[Trigonometric ratios and angle identification|trigonometric ratios]] for angle theta (θ), located between the sides of length 4 and 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

*   **Opposite side to θ**: The side with length 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **Adjacent side to θ**: The side with length 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   **Hypotenuse**: The side with length 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

Using SOH CAH TOA:
*   **Sine (θ)** = Opposite / Hypotenuse = 3 / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>
*   **Cosine (θ)** = Adjacent / Hypotenuse = 4 / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>
*   **Tangent (θ)** = Opposite / Adjacent = 3 / 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>

### Example 2: Angle X

Now, let's consider another angle, angle x, which is the acute angle opposite the side of length 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

*   **Opposite side to x**: The side with length 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   **Adjacent side to x**: The side with length 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   **Hypotenuse**: Remains the side with length 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

Using SOH CAH TOA for angle x:
*   **Sine (x)** = Opposite / Hypotenuse = 4 / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>
*   **Cosine (x)** = Adjacent / Hypotenuse = 3 / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>
*   **Tangent (x)** = Opposite / Adjacent = 4 / 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>

This demonstration illustrates how the "opposite" and "adjacent" sides shift depending on the angle being referenced, while the hypotenuse remains constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. The [[SOHCAHTOA Mnemonic|SOH CAH TOA mnemonic]] is a fundamental tool for understanding [[Trigonometric ratios and soh cah toa mnemonic|trigonometric ratios]] for angles between 0 and 90 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

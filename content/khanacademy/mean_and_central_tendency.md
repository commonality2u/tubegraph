[[Central tendency]] refers to a typical or central value for a probability distribution. The [[mean_median_and_mode | mean]], [[understanding_median | median]], and [[mean_median_and_mode | mode]] are all measures of [[central_tendency_and_averages | central tendency or averages]] for a data set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. While the median and mode are also ways to measure [[measures_of_central_tendency | central tendency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, the [[calculating_mean | mean]] is frequently used, especially when discussing variance and standard deviation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Calculating the Mean

The method for [[calculating_mean | calculating the mean]] depends on whether you are working with a population or a sample.

### Population Mean
The mean of a population, denoted by the Greek letter *mu* (Î¼), is calculated by summing all data points in the population and dividing by the total number of data points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

$$ \mu = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i}{N} $$
Where:
*   $\mu$ is the population mean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>
*   $x_i$ represents each individual data point in the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>
*   $\sum$ denotes the sum of all data points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   $N$ is the total number of data points in the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>

This is the traditional way of calculating an average: add up all the data points and divide by how many there are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### Sample Mean
The mean of a sample, often denoted as *x-bar* ($\bar{x}$), is calculated similarly to the population mean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. However, it uses slightly different notation to reflect that it's derived from a subset of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

$$ \bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n} $$
Where:
*   $\bar{x}$ is the sample mean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>
*   $x_i$ represents each individual data point in the sample <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>
*   $\sum$ denotes the sum of all data points in the sample <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>
*   $n$ is the total number of data points in the sample <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a> (where $n < N$)

## Example Calculation

Let's calculate the mean for a population with the data points: 1, 2, 3, 8, 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

1.  **Sum the data points**:
    $1 + 2 + 3 + 8 + 7 = 21$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>
2.  **Count the number of data points**:
    There are 5 data points ($N=5$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
3.  **Divide the sum by the count**:
    $\mu = \frac{21}{5} = 4.20$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>

Therefore, the mean of this population is 4.20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

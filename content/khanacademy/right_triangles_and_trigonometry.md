[[Definition of Trigonometry|Trigonometry]] is a branch of mathematics focused on the study of [[right_triangles_and_the_pythagorean_theorem|right triangles]] and the relationships between their sides and angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The word "trigonometry" itself is thought to derive from Ancient Greek, meaning "triangle measure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. By understanding [[basics_of_trigonometry|trigonometry]], you can learn what certain buttons on a calculator do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Understanding Right Triangles

A [[right_triangles_and_the_pythagorean_theorem|right triangle]] is a triangle that includes one 90-degree angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. In a [[right_triangles_and_the_pythagorean_theorem|right triangle]], the longest side, or the side opposite the [[right_triangles_and_the_pythagorean_theorem|right angle]], is called the hypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

Trigonometric functions define the ratios of the sides of a triangle relative to a specific angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Core Trigonometric Functions: Sine, Cosine, and Tangent

The three fundamental [[core_trigonometric_functions_sine_cosine_and_tangent|trigonometric functions]] are sine (sin), cosine (cos), and tangent (tan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. These functions describe the relationships between the angles and the lengths of the sides in a [[right_triangles_and_the_pythagorean_theorem|right triangle]].

To remember these relationships, a common mnemonic is **SOH CAH TOA** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>:

*   **SOH**: **S**ine = **O**pposite / **H**ypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>
*   **CAH**: **C**osine = **A**djacent / **H**ypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>
*   **TOA**: **T**angent = **O**pposite / **A**djacent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>

In [[basics_of_trigonometry|trigonometry]], the Greek letter *theta* (θ) is commonly used to represent the angle for which the trigonometric function is being calculated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

### Example: Calculating Trigonometric Ratios

Consider a [[right_triangles_and_the_pythagorean_theorem|right triangle]] with sides of length 3, 4, and a hypotenuse of 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Let's denote one of the acute angles as *theta* (θ) and the other as *x* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

#### For Angle Theta (θ)

Assume the side of length 4 is opposite angle θ, and the side of length 3 is adjacent to angle θ. The hypotenuse is 5.

*   **[[trigonometric_ratios_and_angle_identification|Sine of Theta (sin θ)]]**
    *   Using SOH (Opposite/Hypotenuse):
    *   The side opposite θ is 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
    *   The hypotenuse is 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
    *   Therefore, sin θ = 4/5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

*   **[[trigonometric_ratios_and_angle_identification|Cosine of Theta (cos θ)]]**
    *   Using CAH (Adjacent/Hypotenuse):
    *   The side adjacent to θ is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
    *   The hypotenuse is 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
    *   Therefore, cos θ = 3/5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

*   **[[trigonometric_ratios_and_angle_identification|Tangent of Theta (tan θ)]]**
    *   Using TOA (Opposite/Adjacent):
    *   The side opposite θ is 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
    *   The side adjacent to θ is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
    *   Therefore, tan θ = 4/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

#### For Angle X

Now, let's consider the other acute angle, *x*, in the same triangle.

*   **[[trigonometric_ratios_and_angle_identification|Tangent of X (tan x)]]**
    *   Using TOA (Opposite/Adjacent):
    *   The side opposite *x* is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
    *   The side adjacent to *x* is 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
    *   Therefore, tan x = 3/4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

This example illustrates that the trigonometric functions for an angle depend on which angle of the [[right_triangles_and_the_pythagorean_theorem|right triangle]] is being considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

## Practical Applications

[[Practical Applications of Trigonometry|Trigonometry]] allows you to determine unknown angles or side lengths of a [[right_triangles_and_the_pythagorean_theorem|right triangle]] if you have enough information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. For instance, if you know an angle and a side, or a couple of sides, you can calculate the remaining angles or sides using a calculator, slide ruler, or trigonometric table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. This will be explored further in subsequent lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

In chemistry, particularly when discussing mixtures, the terms "solvent" and "solute" are fundamental for understanding solutions.

## Solution
A [[basic_concepts_of_elements_and_atoms | solution]] is formed when one substance is dissolved into another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This combination of molecules forms a homogeneous mixture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Solvent
The **solvent** is the substance that there is more of in a [[basic_concepts_of_elements_and_atoms | solution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This quantity refers to the number of [[basic_concepts_of_elements_and_atoms | molecules]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The solvent is often described as the substance "doing the dissolving" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

*   **Example:** In a mixture of water and sugar, where water is more abundant, water is the solvent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Common Solvent:** Water is the most common solvent in most biological and chemical systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. However, other substances like alcohol or mercury can also act as solvents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

## Solute
The **solute** is the substance that there is less of in a [[basic_concepts_of_elements_and_atoms | solution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. It is the substance that gets "dissolved" by the solvent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

*   **Example:** In a mixture of water and sugar, sugar is the solute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Any [[basic_concepts_of_elements_and_atoms | molecule]] present in lesser quantity can be a solute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Related Concepts

### Dissolving
When a solute is mixed with a solvent, the solute is "dissolved" into the solvent, forming a [[basic_concepts_of_elements_and_atoms | solution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

### Concentration
**Concentration** describes how much of a particular [[basic_concepts_of_elements_and_atoms | particle]] or solute is present per unit of space within a [[basic_concepts_of_elements_and_atoms | solution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

*   A **high concentration** means there are many [[basic_concepts_of_elements_and_atoms | particles]] per unit space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Solutions with a high solute concentration are called [[hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | hypertonic]] solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   A **low concentration** means there are very few [[basic_concepts_of_elements_and_atoms | particles]] per unit space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Solutions with a low solute concentration are called [[hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | hypotonic]] solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

### Diffusion
[[concentration_gradients_and_equilibrium | Diffusion]] is the process where [[basic_concepts_of_elements_and_atoms | particles]] or [[basic_concepts_of_elements_and_atoms | molecules]] spread out from an area of [[concentration_gradients_and_equilibrium | high concentration]] to an area of [[concentration_gradients_and_equilibrium | low concentration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. This process occurs due to the random movement and collisions of [[basic_concepts_of_elements_and_atoms | molecules]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Over time, [[basic_concepts_of_elements_and_atoms | particles]] will spread out until their concentrations are roughly equal across the system, reaching a state of [[concentration_gradients_and_equilibrium | equilibrium]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

### Osmosis
[[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | Osmosis]] is a specific type of [[concentration_gradients_and_equilibrium | diffusion]] that refers to the [[concentration_gradients_and_equilibrium | diffusion]] of a solvent (typically water) through a [[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | semi-permeable membrane]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. A [[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | semi-permeable membrane]] allows the solvent [[basic_concepts_of_elements_and_atoms | molecules]] to pass through but restricts the passage of solute [[basic_concepts_of_elements_and_atoms | molecules]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. In [[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | osmosis]], water will move from a region of [[hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | hypotonic]] (lower solute concentration) to a [[hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | hypertonic]] (higher solute concentration) region, in an attempt to equalize the concentrations on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.

*   The concept of [[applying_the_concept_of_moles_in_chemistry | moles]] can be used for a more detailed discussion of concentration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

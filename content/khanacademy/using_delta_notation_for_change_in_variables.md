Delta notation, represented by the Greek capital letter delta (Î”), is a mathematical symbol used to denote a "change in" a variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. It provides a concise way to express the difference between an initial and final value of a quantity.

## Slope and Change

Slope describes the steepness of a line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. It is fundamentally defined as the "change in y over change in x" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. For any given line, this ratio remains constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

Using delta notation, the formula for slope is commonly written as:

$m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>

Where:
*   $\Delta y$ represents the change in the y-coordinate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   $\Delta x$ represents the change in the x-coordinate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Calculating Change

To find the change in a variable, you determine the difference between its starting and ending values.

### Example: Calculating Slope

Consider two points on a line:
*   **Point 1:** (-3, -3)
*   **Point 2:** (0, -1)

1.  **Calculate $\Delta x$ (change in x):**
    Moving from x = -3 to x = 0, the change in x is 3 units (0 - (-3) = 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
    So, $\Delta x = 3$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
2.  **Calculate $\Delta y$ (change in y):**
    Moving from y = -3 to y = -1, the change in y is 2 units (-1 - (-3) = 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
    So, $\Delta y = 2$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
3.  **Calculate Slope:**
    Slope $= \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{2}{3}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

### Consistency in Calculation

It's crucial to be consistent when calculating $\Delta y$ and $\Delta x$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. If you pick any two points on a line, the slope will always be the same value, provided you define your "start" and "end" points consistently for both x and y <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

For instance, consider these two points:
*   **Point 3:** (3, 1)
*   **Point 4:** (-3, -3)

1.  **If starting from Point 3 to Point 4:**
    *   $\Delta y$ (from 1 to -3) = -4 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
    *   $\Delta x$ (from 3 to -3) = -6 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
    *   Slope $= \frac{-4}{-6} = \frac{2}{3}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

2.  **If starting from Point 4 to Point 3:**
    *   $\Delta y$ (from -3 to 1) = 4 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
    *   $\Delta x$ (from -3 to 3) = 6 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
    *   Slope $= \frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

In both cases, the slope remains $2/3$, demonstrating the consistency of delta notation for calculating change regardless of the direction of traversal along the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

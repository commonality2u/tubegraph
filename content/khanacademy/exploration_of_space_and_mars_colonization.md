Elon Musk's ventures into space exploration stem from a fundamental question about the future of humanity and the significant impact areas he identified during his college years: the internet, [[sustainable_energy_and_future_technology_predictions | sustainable energy]], and [[spacexs_mission_and_advancements | space exploration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. He believes humanity faces a substantial choice: to become a multi-planet species or be confined to Earth until an inevitable eventual extinction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. While not pessimistic about life on Earth, he notes that "something bad is bound to happen if you give it enough time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. If human civilization continues its current pace of technological advancement for a million years, he believes we would either be extinct or on many planets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

## The Genesis of SpaceX

In 2001, after his work with PayPal, Musk questioned why humanity had not yet sent people to Mars, which he saw as the "obvious next step after Apollo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. He noted that in 1969, people expected moon bases, Mars missions, and orbiting space hotels by 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. In contrast, by 2013, the United States couldn't even send anyone to orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.

His initial inquiry into why Mars missions weren't happening led him to the NASA website, where he expected to find a scheduled date for a Mars mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. He was disappointed to discover NASA had no plans to send people to Mars or even back to the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.

Musk initially thought the issue was a "lack of national will" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. To re-excite people about space, he conceived the "Mars Oasis" idea: sending a small greenhouse with seeds to Mars to grow green plants on the red surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. This would be the "first life on Mars" and the "furthest that life's ever traveled," aiming to create a visually striking moment for the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. He was willing to spend half the money he earned from PayPal on this mission, with no expectation of financial return, seeing it as an important endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.

His friends tried to dissuade him from starting a [[spacexs_mission_and_advancements | rocket company]], even showing him videos of rockets exploding, believing it was a "crazy idea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. However, since he already expected to lose the money, their premise for talking him out of it didn't hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.

### Shifting Focus: From "Will" to "Way"

After three trips to Russia in 2001 and 2002 to negotiate the purchase of ICBMs for his Mars Oasis project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>, Musk realized his initial premise was wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. He concluded that there was "tremendous amount of will" for [[spacexs_mission_and_advancements | space exploration]] in the United States, as it is a "nation of explorers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>. The real issue was that people wouldn't support space exploration if it meant sacrificing essential services like healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. Therefore, what was truly lacking was "a way" to make space exploration affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>.

This realization led him to ask: "How hard is it really to make a rocket?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>. He reasoned that historical rocket costs didn't dictate future costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. By breaking down a rocket into its raw materials (aluminum, titanium, copper, carbon fiber), he found that the material cost was only about 2% of the total rocket cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>. This indicated that the primary cost was in the "arrangement of atoms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>, leading to the goal of arranging them "much more efficiently" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>. After extensive research and consulting with aerospace professionals, and finding "no catch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>, he founded [[spacexs_mission_and_advancements | SpaceX]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>.

## SpaceX's Advancements and Future Vision

[[spacexs_mission_and_advancements | SpaceX]]'s first rocket, the Falcon 1, ended up costing around $6 million, compared to $25 million for other rockets in its class, achieving a quarter of the price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>. The Falcon 9 rocket costs about $60 million to build, but its propellant is only about $200,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a>.

The next major step for [[spacexs_mission_and_advancements | SpaceX]] is making rockets reusable, which could make them "two orders of magnitude cheaper," or 100th of the price per launch for the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>. This involves rockets returning to the launch site and landing vertically, similar to airplanes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>. While [[spacexs_mission_and_advancements | SpaceX]] has recovered spacecraft from orbit, attempts to recover rocket stages had resulted in explosions on reentry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>. The challenge lies in designing rockets that can achieve orbit with sufficient payload while reserving mass for reusability elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>. Musk is hopeful for successful reusable rocket landings by 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>.

### Commercialization and Mars Colonization

[[spacexs_mission_and_advancements | SpaceX]]'s immediate goal is to earn enough money to sustain operations by launching commercial and government satellites (for broadcast, communication, mapping, GPS, scientific missions) and servicing the International Space Station by transferring cargo and people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>. This revenue helps fund the continuous improvement of technology needed for full reusability and, eventually, to take people to Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>.

Elon Musk estimates that humanity could have someone on Mars in about 12 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>. He anticipates it will likely be a round trip initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:59">[00:29:59]</a>. This timeline coincides with his prediction for the widespread adoption of [[development_of_electric_vehicles_and_Teslas_mission | electric vehicles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>.

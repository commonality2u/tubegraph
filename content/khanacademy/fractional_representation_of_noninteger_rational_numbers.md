## Definition of Rational Numbers
A [[rational_numbers_and_integer_representation | rational number]] is any number that can be represented as the ratio of two [[rational_numbers_and_integer_representation | integers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Integers as Rational Numbers
Any [[rational_numbers_and_integer_representation | integer]] is considered a [[rational_numbers_and_integer_representation | rational number]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. For instance:
*   The number 1 can be represented as 1/1, -2/-2, or 10,000/10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. These are all different representations of 1 as a ratio of two [[rational_numbers_and_integer_representation | integers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. There are an infinite number of ways to represent 1 in this manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   The number -7 can be represented as -7/1, 7/-1, or -14/2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Thus, -7 is a [[rational_numbers_and_integer_representation | rational number]] because it can be expressed as the ratio of two [[rational_numbers_and_integer_representation | integers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Non-Integer Rational Numbers
[[rational_numbers_and_integer_representation | Rational numbers]] also include values that are not [[rational_numbers_and_integer_representation | integers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### Finite Decimals
A finite decimal, such as 3.75, can be represented as the ratio of two [[rational_numbers_and_integer_representation | integers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   3.75 can be rewritten as 375/100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, which is equivalent to 750/200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   Alternatively, 3.75 is equal to 3 and 3/4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, which converts to the [[improper_fractions_as_decimals | improper fraction]] 15/4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   This can also be expressed as -30/-8 (by multiplying the numerator and denominator by -2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
These examples demonstrate how 3.75 is a [[rational_numbers_and_integer_representation | rational number]] through multiple representations as the ratio of two [[rational_numbers_and_integer_representation | integers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

### Repeating Decimals
[[recurring_decimals_representation | Repeating decimals]] are also [[rational_numbers_and_integer_representation | rational numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   The most famous example is 0.333... (or 0.3 repeating), which can be denoted by a bar over the 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This is equivalent to 1/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   Another example is 0.6 repeating, which is 2/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
Any [[repeating_decimals_as_rational_numbers | repeating decimal]], regardless of the number of repeating digits, can always be represented as the ratio of two [[rational_numbers_and_integer_representation | integers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Methods for [[decimals_to_fractions_conversion | converting decimals to fractions]] show this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

## Distinction from Irrational Numbers
The numbers described above, including all [[rational_numbers_and_integer_representation | integers]], finite non-repeating decimals, and [[repeating_decimals_as_rational_numbers | repeating decimals]], are all [[rational_numbers_and_integer_representation | rational numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Numbers that cannot be expressed as a ratio of two [[rational_numbers_and_integer_representation | integers]] are called [[irrational_numbers_and_their_characteristics | irrational numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### Characteristics of Irrational Numbers
Some of the most famous numbers in mathematics are [[irrational_numbers_and_their_characteristics | irrational numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   Pi (π), the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, is an [[irrational_numbers_and_their_characteristics | irrational number]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. It never terminates and never repeats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   The number *e* also never terminates and never repeats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   The square root of 2 is an [[irrational_numbers_and_their_characteristics | irrational number]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Taking the square root of any non-perfect square will result in an [[irrational_numbers_and_their_characteristics | irrational number]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   Phi (φ), the golden ratio, is an [[irrational_numbers_and_their_characteristics | irrational number]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
These numbers often "pop out" of nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### Abundance of Irrational Numbers
While [[irrational_numbers_and_their_characteristics | irrational numbers]] may seem exotic, they are not uncommon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   There is always an [[irrational_numbers_and_their_characteristics | irrational number]] between any two [[rational_numbers_and_integer_representation | rational numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. In fact, there is an infinite number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This suggests that there aren't fewer [[irrational_numbers_and_their_characteristics | irrational numbers]] than [[rational_numbers_and_integer_representation | rational numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   The sum of an [[irrational_numbers_and_their_characteristics | irrational number]] and a [[rational_numbers_and_integer_representation | rational number]] is always [[irrational_numbers_and_their_characteristics | irrational]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   The product of an [[irrational_numbers_and_their_characteristics | irrational number]] and a [[rational_numbers_and_integer_representation | rational number]] is also always [[irrational_numbers_and_their_characteristics | irrational]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
These properties demonstrate the vast quantity of [[irrational_numbers_and_their_characteristics | irrational numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

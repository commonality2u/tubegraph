From: [[khanacademy]] <br/> 

The [[dna_and_its_function_in_cells | structure of DNA]], a double helix resembling a twisted ladder, is inherently suited to be the molecular basis of heredity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This video conceptually explains the mechanisms by which [[dna_and_its_function_in_cells | DNA]] fulfills this role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

A [[dna_and_its_function_in_cells | DNA molecule]] can be tens of millions of base pairs long, significantly more than a handful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. A small section of [[dna_and_its_function_in_cells | DNA]] depicted in a diagram might represent just a tiny part of a much longer molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Requirements for a Molecular Basis of Heredity

A molecular basis of heredity must primarily fulfill two requirements:
1.  **Replication**: It must be able to be replicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
2.  **Expression**: The information it contains must be expressible to define an organism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

## Replication

As a [[cellular_structure_and_functions | cell divides]], the two new [[cellular_structure_and_functions | cells]] need to receive the same genetic material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The process of [[process_of_dna_replication | DNA replication]] involves splitting the two sides of the DNA "ladder" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Each half then serves as a template to construct the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

In [[process_of_dna_replication | DNA]], adenine (A) always pairs with thymine (T), and guanine (G) always pairs with cytosine (C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. By following these pairing rules, each original strand can be used to construct a new complementary strand, resulting in two identical [[process_of_dna_replication | DNA]] molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. This [[process_of_dna_replication | replication]] occurs before a [[cellular_structure_and_functions | cell duplicates itself]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

## Expression

The information encoded in [[dna_and_its_function_in_cells | DNA]] must be used to define the organism and express what is happening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This process is called [[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | expression]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

### DNA, Chromosome, and Gene
While related, these terms have distinct meanings:
*   **[[dna_and_its_function_in_cells | DNA]]**: Refers to the molecule itself, with its sugar-phosphate backbone, sequence of base pairs, and double helix structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **[[dna_and_its_function_in_cells | Chromosome]]**: A [[dna_and_its_function_in_cells | DNA]] molecule packaged together with other molecules and proteins, forming a broader structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   **[[dna_and_its_function_in_cells | Gene]]**: A [[dna_and_its_function_in_cells | section of DNA]] that [[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | codes for a certain type of protein]] or defines a specific trait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. [[dna_and_its_function_in_cells | Genes]] can range from several thousand to millions of base pairs long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

### Role of RNA in Gene Expression

The information from [[dna_and_its_function_in_cells | DNA]] is expressed through a [[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | related molecule to DNA, and that is RNA]] (ribonucleic acid) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. In [[cellular_structure_and_functions | cells with nuclei]], the [[cellular_structure_and_functions | DNA sits there but that information has to for the most part get outside of the nucleus in order to be expressed]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. [[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | RNA]] acts as the [[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | messenger]] to transport this genetic information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

### Transcription

[[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | Transcription]] is the process of creating a [[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule]] from a [[dna_and_its_function_in_cells | DNA]] template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Similar to [[process_of_dna_replication | DNA replication]], one strand of [[dna_and_its_function_in_cells | DNA]] is used as a template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. However, in [[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | RNA]], adenine (A) pairs with uracil (U) instead of thymine (T), while cytosine (C) still pairs with guanine (G) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. This process yields a [[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | single strand of RNA]] (specifically [[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | mRNA]]) that carries the genetic information from a specific gene out of the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

### Translation

After [[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | transcription]], the [[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | mRNA]] [[cellular_structure_and_functions | leaves the nucleus and attaches to a ribosome]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>, where [[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | translation]] occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. This process converts the base pair sequence of the [[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | mRNA]] into an amino acid sequence, which forms a protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

Every three bases on the [[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | mRNA]] sequence constitute a "codon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. There are 64 possible codons (4 bases to the power of 3 positions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. These codons code for 20 different amino acids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>, with some amino acids being coded by more than one codon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. Another type of [[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | RNA]], transfer RNA (tRNA), is responsible for bringing the specific amino acids to the ribosome based on the codons on the [[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | mRNA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

As amino acids are linked together in a specific sequence, a protein is constructed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. Proteins are vital molecules that perform many functions in life, acting as enzymes, providing structural support (like muscle), and carrying out much of the "work of life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. They can be thousands of amino acids long and fold into complex shapes to perform their functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.

[[introduction_to_linear_equations|Linear equations]] are algebraic expressions where a variable, typically `x`, is multiplied by a coefficient (a number) and set equal to another number. Solving them involves finding the value of the variable that makes the equation true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Basic Structure and Notation

A common form of a linear equation with integers is `ax = b`, where 'a' and 'b' are integers and 'x' is the variable you need to solve for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

For example, consider the equation `5x = 20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.
*   The `5` written directly next to the `x` signifies multiplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. So, `5x` is the same as `5 * x` or "5 times x" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   The equation `5x = 20` asks: "5 times what number equals 20?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Systematic Approach to Solving

While simple equations like `5x = 20` might be solvable mentally, a systematic approach is crucial for more complex problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. The core principle is to perform the same operation on both sides of the equation to maintain equality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

### Method 1: Division

To isolate the variable `x`, you can divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

Let's use `5x = 20`:
1.  Divide the left side by 5: `5x / 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The 5s cancel out, leaving `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
2.  Divide the right side by 5: `20 / 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This equals 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
3.  Therefore, `x = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

### Method 2: Multiplying by the Reciprocal

An equivalent method is to multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of the coefficient of `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. This is particularly useful when dealing with [[solving_linear_equations_with_fractions|fractions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

For `5x = 20`:
1.  The reciprocal of 5 is 1/5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
2.  Multiply the left side by 1/5: `(1/5) * 5x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This simplifies to `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
3.  Multiply the right side by 1/5: `(1/5) * 20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This simplifies to 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
4.  Thus, `x = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

The methods of dividing by a number and multiplying by its reciprocal are mathematically identical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Checking Your Answer

A valuable aspect of [[solving_equations_with_variables|algebra]] is the ability to verify your solution by substituting the calculated value of `x` back into the original equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

For `5x = 20`, with `x = 4`:
1.  Substitute 4 for `x`: `5 * 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
2.  Calculate the product: `20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
3.  Compare to the original right side: `20 = 20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
4.  Since both sides are equal, the answer is correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

Solving equations that involve negative numbers follows the same fundamental principles as solving any other equation. The key is to perform the same operation on both sides of the equation to maintain equality and isolate the variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Basic Principles of Solving Equations

When solving an equation like `3x + 5 = 17` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, the goal is to isolate the term containing the variable (`3x`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

To remove a constant term (like the `+5`), you perform the inverse operation on both sides of the equation.
For `3x + 5 = 17`:
1.  Subtract `5` from both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
    *   `3x + 5 - 5 = 17 - 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>
    *   This simplifies to `3x = 12` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
2.  To isolate `x`, divide both sides by `3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
    *   `3x / 3 = 12 / 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>
    *   This results in `x = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

## Solving Equations with Negative Numbers

When negative numbers are involved, the process remains the same, but careful attention to [[negative_number_arithmetic | negative number arithmetic]] is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

Consider the equation `7x - 2 = -10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

1.  **Isolate the variable term:** The first step is to eliminate the `-2` on the left-hand side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
    *   To get rid of a negative `2`, you add `2` to both sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
        > `7x - 2 + 2 = -10 + 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>
    *   On the left side, `-2 + 2` cancels out to `0`, leaving `7x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
    *   On the right side, calculate `-10 + 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
        *   This requires [[adding_negative_numbers | understanding negative numbers on a number line]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. If you start at `-10` on a number line and move `2` units in the positive direction (to the right), you land on `-8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
        > **Common Pitfall:** Do not confuse `-10 + 2` with `10 + 2` or `-10 - 2`. [[understanding_negative_numbers_on_a_number_line | Adding a positive number to a negative number]] means moving right on the number line, becoming less negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

    The equation simplifies to `7x = -8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

2.  **Solve for the variable:** Now, to isolate `x`, divide both sides by `7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
    > `7x / 7 = -8 / 7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>
    *   On the left, `7x / 7` simplifies to `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
    *   On the right, `-8 / 7` can be left as an improper fraction or converted to a mixed number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
        > `x = -8/7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>
        > `x = -1 and 1/7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>

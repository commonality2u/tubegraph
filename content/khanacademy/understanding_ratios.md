Ratios are mathematical expressions used to [[understanding_and_manipulating_equalities | compare quantities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. They indicate how many of one quantity there are for a certain number of another quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Expressing Ratios in Different Forms
There are several ways to express ratios:
*   **Using a colon (A:B)**: For example, the ratio of 10 horses to 5 dogs can be written as 10:5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   **As a fraction (A/B)**: The same ratio can be written as 10/5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   **Using the word "to"**: The ratio can also be stated as "10 to 5" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

All these forms convey the same comparison between quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Order in Ratios
The order of the quantities in a ratio is crucial. The quantity mentioned first (or placed on top in a fraction) corresponds to the first number in the ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

For example, if you have 10 horses and 5 dogs:
*   The ratio of horses to dogs is 10:5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   The ratio of dogs to horses is 5:10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

## [[reducing_ratios_to_simplest_form | Reducing Ratios to Simplest Form]]
Ratios are typically expressed in their simplest form, similar to [[simplifying_fractions | simplifying fractions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. To [[methods_for_simplifying_fractions | simplify a ratio]], divide both quantities by their greatest common divisor (GCD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

**Example: Horses to Dogs**
Given 10 horses and 5 dogs, the ratio of horses to dogs is 10:5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
1.  Find the greatest common divisor of 10 and 5, which is 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
2.  Divide both numbers by 5:
    *   10 ÷ 5 = 2
    *   5 ÷ 5 = 1
3.  The simplified ratio of horses to dogs is 2:1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This means for every 2 horses, there is 1 dog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## [[calculating_ratios_with_multiple_items | Calculating Ratios with Multiple Items]]
Ratios can also compare more than two quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

**Example: Fruits**
If you have 20 apples, 40 oranges, and 60 strawberries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>:
1.  The initial ratio of apples to oranges to strawberries is 20:40:60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
2.  To simplify, find the largest number that divides into all three quantities. In this case, it is 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
3.  Divide each number by 20:
    *   20 ÷ 20 = 1
    *   40 ÷ 20 = 2
    *   60 ÷ 20 = 3
4.  The simplified ratio is 1:2:3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. This means for every 1 apple, there are 2 oranges and 3 strawberries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
5.  If the order of items is changed, the order of numbers in the ratio also changes. For example, the ratio of strawberries to oranges to apples would be 3:2:1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

## [[finding_quantities_from_given_ratios | Finding Quantities from Ratios and Total]]
Sometimes, you are given a ratio and the total number of items, and you need to find the specific quantity of each item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

**Example: Classroom Students**
The ratio of boys to girls in a classroom is 2:3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, and there are 40 students in total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

1.  **Determine the "group size"**: Add the numbers in the ratio to find the total parts in one group.
    *   2 (boys) + 3 (girls) = 5 students per group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
    *   This means for every 5 students, there are 2 boys and 3 girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
2.  **Calculate the number of groups**: Divide the total number of students by the group size.
    *   40 total students ÷ 5 students/group = 8 groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.
3.  **Find the quantity for each item**: Multiply the number of groups by the ratio part for that item.
    *   For girls: 8 groups × 3 girls/group = 24 girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
    *   For boys: 8 groups × 2 boys/group = 16 boys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
    *   (Alternatively, 40 total students - 24 girls = 16 boys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>).

**Example: Farm Animals**
The ratio of sheep to chickens to pigs is 2:5:10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, and there are 51 animals in total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. How many chickens are there?

1.  **Determine the "group size"**:
    *   2 (sheep) + 5 (chickens) + 10 (pigs) = 17 animals per group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.
2.  **Calculate the number of groups**:
    *   51 total animals ÷ 17 animals/group = 3 groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.
3.  **Find the quantity for chickens**:
    *   3 groups × 5 chickens/group = 15 chickens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.

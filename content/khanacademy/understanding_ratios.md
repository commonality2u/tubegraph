Ratios are expressions that [[comparing_quantities_using_ratios | compare quantities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. They indicate how much of one quantity there is in relation to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Representing Ratios

Ratios can be expressed in several ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>:
*   Using a colon (e.g., 10:5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>
*   As a [[representation_of_rational_numbers_as_fractions | fraction]] (e.g., 10/5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>
*   Written out (e.g., "10 to 5") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>

The order of the quantities in the expression matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. For example, if expressing the ratio of horses to dogs, the number of horses comes first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

> [!example] Example: Horses and Dogs
> If you have 10 horses and 5 dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>:
> *   The ratio of horses to dogs is 10:5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
> *   The ratio of dogs to horses is 5:10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

## [[reducing_ratios_to_simplest_form | Reducing Ratios to Simplest Form]]

Ratios can often be simplified or "reduced" to their simplest form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This is done by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numbers in the ratio and dividing each number by it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

> [!example] Simplifying the Ratio 10:5
> The greatest common divisor of 10 and 5 is 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
> Dividing both numbers by 5:
> *   10 ÷ 5 = 2
> *   5 ÷ 5 = 1
>
> So, the ratio 10:5 reduces to 2:1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. This means there are 2 horses for every 1 dog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
>
> The simplified ratio of dogs to horses (from 5:10) would be 1:2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
>
> While 5:10 is not incorrect, the general convention is to express ratios in their simplest, or reduced, form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

## [[complex_ratio_problems_involving_multiple_quantities | Ratios with Multiple Quantities]]

Ratios can also compare more than two quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. The principle of reduction remains the same: find the greatest common divisor for all quantities and divide each by it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

> [!example] Apples, Oranges, and Strawberries
> If you have 20 apples, 40 oranges, and 60 strawberries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>:
> *   The ratio of apples to oranges to strawberries is 20:40:60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
> *   The largest number that divides into all three (20, 40, and 60) is 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
> *   Dividing each quantity by 20:
>     *   20 ÷ 20 = 1
>     *   40 ÷ 20 = 2
>     *   60 ÷ 20 = 3
> *   The simplified ratio is 1:2:3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. This means for every 1 apple, there are 2 oranges and 3 strawberries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
>
> The order of the ratio reflects the order of the items requested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. So, the ratio of strawberries to oranges to apples would be 3:2:1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## [[using_ratios_to_determine_quantities | Using Ratios to Determine Quantities]]

Ratios can also be used to find unknown quantities when a total amount is known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

> [!example] Boys and Girls in a Classroom
> The ratio of boys to girls in a classroom is 2:3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. There are 40 students total in the classroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. How many girls are there?
>
> 1.  **Determine the total parts in the ratio:** Add the parts of the ratio: 2 (boys) + 3 (girls) = 5 total parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. This means for every 5 students, there are 2 boys and 3 girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
> 2.  **Calculate the number of "groups":** Divide the total number of students by the total parts in the ratio: 40 students ÷ 5 students/group = 8 groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
> 3.  **Find the specific quantity:** Multiply the number of groups by the ratio part for girls: 8 groups × 3 girls/group = 24 girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
>
> Similarly, there would be 8 groups × 2 boys/group = 16 boys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. This can be checked: 24 girls + 16 boys = 40 students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

> [!example] Sheep, Chickens, and Pigs
> The ratio of sheep to chickens to pigs is 2:5:10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. There are 51 animals total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. How many chickens are there?
>
> 1.  **Total parts in the ratio:** 2 + 5 + 10 = 17 total parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. For every 17 animals, there are 2 sheep, 5 chickens, and 10 pigs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
> 2.  **Number of groups:** 51 animals ÷ 17 animals/group = 3 groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.
> 3.  **Number of chickens:** 3 groups × 5 chickens/group = 15 chickens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

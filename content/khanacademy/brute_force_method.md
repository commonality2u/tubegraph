The "brute force method" is a straightforward approach to finding the least common multiple (LCM) of two or more numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. It involves listing out the multiples of each number until a common multiple is found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. The smallest number that appears in all lists is the least common multiple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

## How it Works

To find the least common multiple of two numbers, for example, 18 and 12, using the brute force method:
1.  **List multiples of the first number**:
    *   Multiples of 18 are 18, 36, 54, and so on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
2.  **List multiples of the second number**:
    *   Multiples of 12 are 12, 24, 36, and so on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
3.  **Identify the smallest common multiple**:
    *   By comparing the lists, 36 is the first and smallest number that appears in both lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

## When to Use and Limitations

While intuitive, this method can become less efficient when dealing with very large numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. For extremely large numbers, one might have to list many multiples before finding a common one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. In such cases, alternative methods like the [[prime_factorization_method | prime factorization approach]] are often preferred as they offer a more [[systematic_approach_to_solving_equations | systematic approach]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

This one, you're kind of-- it's fun, because you're actually decomposing the number and then building it back up. And also, this is a better way, especially if you're doing it with really, really large and hairy numbers." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>

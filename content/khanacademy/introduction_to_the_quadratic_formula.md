The [[solving_quadratic_equations_using_the_quadratic_formula | quadratic formula]] is considered one of the most useful formulas in mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. While memorization is generally not recommended, it is suggested to memorize this formula, with the important caveat of also understanding its proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Its primary purpose is to [[solving_quadratic_equations | solve for the roots, or zeroes of quadratic equations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Understanding the Components of a Quadratic Equation

A [[understanding_components_of_a_quadratic_equation | quadratic equation]] in its general form is expressed as:
`ax² + bx + c = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>

In this equation:
*   `a` is the coefficient of the `x²` (second-degree) term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   `b` is the coefficient of the `x` term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   `c` is the constant term (or the coefficient of the `x` to the zero term) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## The Formula Itself

For a general [[understanding_components_of_a_quadratic_equation | quadratic equation]] `ax² + bx + c = 0`, the [[solving_quadratic_equations_using_the_quadratic_formula | quadratic formula]] provides its solutions as:

> `x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>

Initially, the formula may appear complex, but with practice, it becomes a more manageable tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This formula is derived by [[solving_techniques_for_quadratic_equations | completing the square]] on the general [[understanding_components_of_a_quadratic_equation | quadratic equation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Applying the Quadratic Formula

### Example 1: Factorable Equation Verification

Consider the equation: `x² + 4x - 21 = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>

1.  **Identify coefficients**: `a = 1`, `b = 4`, `c = -21` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
2.  **Substitute into the formula**:
    `x = (-4 ± √(4² - 4 * 1 * -21)) / (2 * 1)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>
3.  **Simplify**:
    `x = (-4 ± √(16 + 84)) / 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>
    `x = (-4 ± √100) / 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>
    `x = (-4 ± 10) / 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>
4.  **Calculate solutions**:
    *   `x = -4 + 10 / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>
    *   `x = -4 - 10 / 2 = -14 / 2 = -7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>

These solutions (`x=3` or `x=-7`) match those found by [[comparison_of_factoring_and_quadratic_formula | factoring]] the equation, which would be `(x + 7)(x - 3) = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. The benefit of the [[solving_quadratic_equations_using_the_quadratic_formula | quadratic formula]] becomes apparent when dealing with equations that are difficult to factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

### Example 2: Equation with No Real Solutions

Consider the equation: `3x² + 6x = -10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>

1.  **Transform to standard form**: Add 10 to both sides to get `3x² + 6x + 10 = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
2.  **Identify coefficients**: `a = 3`, `b = 6`, `c = 10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
3.  **Substitute into the formula**:
    `x = (-6 ± √(6² - 4 * 3 * 10)) / (2 * 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>
4.  **Simplify**:
    `x = (-6 ± √(36 - 120)) / 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>
    `x = (-6 ± √-84) / 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>

In this case, the expression under the square root (`b² - 4ac`), known as the discriminant, is negative (-84) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. This indicates that the equation has no real solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. Graphically, this means the [[graphing_a_quadratic_function | quadratic function]] `y = 3x² + 6x + 10` does not intersect the x-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. Solutions involving imaginary numbers can be expressed when the discriminant is negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

### Example 3: Non-Integer Solutions

Consider the equation: `-3x² + 12x + 1 = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>

1.  **Identify coefficients**: `a = -3`, `b = 12`, `c = 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.
2.  **Substitute into the formula**:
    `x = (-12 ± √(12² - 4 * -3 * 1)) / (2 * -3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>
3.  **Simplify**:
    `x = (-12 ± √(144 + 12)) / -6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>
    `x = (-12 ± √156) / -6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>
4.  **Simplify the radical**: `√156 = √(4 * 39) = 2√39` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.
5.  **Further simplification**:
    `x = (-12 ± 2√39) / -6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>
    Divide numerator and denominator by 2:
    `x = (-6 ± √39) / -3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>
    Separate terms:
    `x = -6 / -3 ± √39 / -3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>
    `x = 2 ± (-√39 / 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>

The solutions are `x = 2 - √39 / 3` and `x = 2 + √39 / 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. This demonstrates the formula's ability to provide exact solutions even when [[solving_quadratic_equations | factoring]] is not straightforward or possible.

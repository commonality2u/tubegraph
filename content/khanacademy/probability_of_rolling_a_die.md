Rolling a die is a common experiment used to introduce [[basic_probability_concepts | probability]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

## Fair Die
A fair die is one where each side has an [[equally_likely_possibilities_in_probability | equal chance]] of landing face up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. For a standard six-sided die, there are six [[equally_likely_possibilities_in_probability | equally likely possibilities]]: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

## Calculating Probability
The [[calculating_probability_of_an_event | probability]] of an event is generally calculated by dividing the number of possibilities that meet specific conditions by the total number of [[equally_likely_possibilities_in_probability | equally likely possibilities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

$$ P(\text{event}) = \frac{\text{Number of possibilities that meet conditions}}{\text{Total number of equally likely possibilities}} $$

### Examples

#### Probability of Rolling a 1
To find the [[calculating_probability_of_an_event | probability]] of rolling a 1 on a fair six-sided die:
*   Total [[equally_likely_possibilities_in_probability | equally likely possibilities]]: 6 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
*   Number of possibilities that meet the condition (rolling a 1): 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

$$ P(\text{rolling a 1}) = \frac{1}{6} $$

#### Probability of Rolling a 1 or a 6
To find the [[calculating_probability_of_an_event | probability]] of rolling a 1 or a 6:
*   Total [[equally_likely_possibilities_in_probability | equally likely possibilities]]: 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   Number of possibilities that meet the conditions (rolling a 1 or a 6): 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

$$ P(\text{rolling a 1 or a 6}) = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3} $$

#### Probability of Rolling a 2 and a 3 (on a single roll)
This scenario asks for two outcomes to occur simultaneously on a single roll.
*   Getting a 2 and getting a 3 are mutually exclusive events, meaning they cannot happen at the same time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
*   Therefore, the [[calculating_probability_of_an_event | probability]] of rolling both a 2 and a 3 on one roll is 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

#### Probability of Rolling an Even Number
To find the [[calculating_probability_of_an_event | probability]] of rolling an even number:
*   Total [[equally_likely_possibilities_in_probability | equally likely possibilities]]: 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
*   Numbers that meet the condition (are even): 2, 4, 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
*   Number of possibilities that meet the conditions: 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

$$ P(\text{rolling an even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} $$

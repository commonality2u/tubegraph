## Introduction to Work and Energy
The terms "work" and "energy" are commonly used in everyday language, but in physics, they have specific definitions, though they are not entirely unrelated to their common usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These [[energy_concepts | concepts of work and energy]] are fundamental for understanding motion and force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>.

### Definitions
The [[definitions_of_work_and_energy | definitions of work and energy]] are somewhat circular:
*   **Work** is defined as energy transferred by a force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>.
*   **Energy** is defined as the ability to do work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:23">[01:23:23]</a>.

While these verbal definitions can seem circular, understanding the [[equations_for_work_and_kinetic_energy | equations for work and kinetic energy]] provides a more quantitative and intuitive understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:41">[01:41:41]</a>.

## Work in Mechanics
In mechanics, the definition of work is quantitative:
Work (W) is equal to force (F) multiplied by distance (d) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:47">[01:47:47]</a>:

$$W = F \cdot d$$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:55">[01:55:55]</a>

### Example Calculation
If a force of 10 Newtons is applied to a block, moving it 7 meters, the work done on the block, or the energy transferred to it, is calculated as follows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>:
*   Force (F) = 10 Newtons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:11">[02:11:11]</a>
*   Distance (d) = 7 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:27">[02:27:27]</a>
*   Work (W) = 10 Newtons * 7 meters = 70 Newton-meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:42">[02:42:42]</a>

### Units of Work and Energy
The unit of work, Newton-meters, is also defined as one Joule (J) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:54">[02:54:54]</a>. Joule is the standard unit for both work and energy, indicating their interchangeable nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:06">[03:06:06]</a>.

## Relation to Kinetic Energy
Work done on an object can change its velocity, leading to the concept of kinetic energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:30">[03:30:30]</a>.

### Derivation of Kinetic Energy Formula
Consider a block of mass 'm' at rest, to which a force 'F' is applied over a distance 'd' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:49">[03:49:49]</a>. This force will accelerate the block, causing it to gain velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:48">[04:48:48]</a>.

Using kinematic equations, specifically the relationship between final velocity ($v_f$), initial velocity ($v_i$), acceleration (a), and distance (d):
$$v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2ad$$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:23">[05:23:23]</a>

Since the block starts at rest, $v_i = 0$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:36">[05:36:36]</a>. The equation simplifies to:
$$v_f^2 = 2ad$$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:44">[05:44:44]</a>

From Newton's second law, Force (F) = mass (m) * acceleration (a), which means acceleration (a) = Force (F) / mass (m) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:03">[06:03:03]</a>. Substituting this into the kinematic equation:
$$v_f^2 = 2 \left( \frac{F}{m} \right) d$$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:12">[06:12:12]</a>
$$v_f^2 = \frac{2Fd}{m}$$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:18">[06:18:18]</a>

Rearranging the equation to isolate the work (Fd) term:
$$mv_f^2 = 2Fd$$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:37">[07:37:37]</a>

Since Work (W) = Force (F) * distance (d) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:12">[07:12:12]</a>, we can substitute W for Fd:
$$mv_f^2 = 2W$$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:51">[07:51:51]</a>
$$W = \frac{1}{2} mv_f^2$$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:58">[07:58:58]</a>

### Definition of Kinetic Energy
This derived formula represents the work imputed into an object to accelerate it from rest to a certain velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:21">[08:21:21]</a>. This quantity is known as **kinetic energy**, which is the energy an object possesses due to its motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:26">[08:26:26]</a>.

The [[kinetic_energy_formula | kinetic energy formula]] is given by:
$$KE = \frac{1}{2} mv^2$$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:51">[08:51:51]</a>

Like work, kinetic energy is measured in Joules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:05">[08:05:05]</a>. This is one fundamental form of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59:59">[08:59:59]</a>.

## Further Concepts
The study of work and kinetic energy leads to understanding other forms of energy and the crucial [[energy_concepts | law of conservation of energy]], which demonstrates how different forms of energy can be converted from one to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:02">[09:02:02]</a>. This interconversion is very useful for analyzing the behavior of objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:08">[09:08:08]</a>.

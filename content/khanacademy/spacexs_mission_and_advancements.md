SpaceX was founded by Elon Musk with the ambitious goal of revolutionizing space travel and making humanity a multi-planet species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. Musk identified [[exploration_of_space_and_Mars_colonization | space exploration]] as one of three key areas that would most profoundly affect the future of humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

## Inception and Motivation

Elon Musk's journey into space began with a fundamental question: why had humanity not sent people to Mars after the Apollo missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>? In 2001, he searched the NASA website for plans to send humans to Mars but found none <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. This discovery was profoundly disappointing, as the general expectation in 1969 was that by 2013, there would be a moon base and people on Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

Initially, Musk considered whether a lack of national will was preventing further space exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. He conceived the "Mars Oasis" project, which aimed to send a small greenhouse with seeds to Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. The goal was to achieve "the first life on Mars" and the "furthest that life's ever traveled," creating a powerful visual of green plants on a red background to re-excite the public about space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>.

Musk was willing to invest half of his earnings from PayPal into this venture, with no expectation of financial return, viewing it as crucial for humanity's expansion beyond Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>. He realized that the primary barrier was not a lack of will, but rather the prohibitive cost of space travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>. People would not sacrifice essential services like healthcare for a Mars mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>; it needed to be economically viable. This led him to focus on finding a "way" to make space travel affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>.

## Cost Reduction and Rocket Development

Musk's approach to cost reduction involved fundamental engineering principles. He broke down the cost of a rocket to its raw materials (aluminum, titanium, copper, carbon fiber) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>. He found that the material cost was only about 2% of a rocket's total cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>, indicating that the high cost lay in the inefficient arrangement of these atoms during manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>.

Initially, Musk attempted to purchase intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) from Russia in 2001 and 2002 to use as launch vehicles, finding US rockets too expensive (e.g., Boeing Delta II at $65 million each) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. He even negotiated a price of about $10 million per ICBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>. However, after three trips to Russia, he realized that he could build rockets more efficiently himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>.

SpaceX began operations and built its first rocket, the Falcon 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>. The first three launches of the Falcon 1 failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. Despite these initial setbacks, the Falcon 1 ultimately cost around $6 million, significantly less than other rockets in its class, which cost about $25 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>. Currently, a new SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket costs about a quarter of the price of comparable rockets from Boeing or Lockheed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>.

## Reusability and Future Vision

A key advancement for SpaceX is the development of reusable rockets, which Musk predicts could make space travel two orders of magnitude cheaper, reducing the cost to potentially a hundredth of the current price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>. The goal is for rockets to land back at the launch site, reload propellant, and take off again, much like an airplane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>. As of the discussion, SpaceX had not yet successfully recovered rocket stages, though they believe they have identified the reasons for previous failures during reentry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>. Musk was hopeful for reusability by the following year (2014) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>.

The challenge of reusability lies in the physics: achieving orbit typically uses 2% to 3% of a rocket's lift-off mass, and reusability components add another 2% to 3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>. The solution involves dramatically improving rocket and engine efficiency to allow for a net payload to orbit even with reusability elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a>. The propellant cost for a Falcon 9 rocket, mostly oxygen, is only about $200,000, comparable to refueling a 747 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>.

SpaceX's mission also involves servicing Earth-based needs to fund its long-term goals. This includes launching commercial, mapping, government, and GPS satellites, as well as transferring cargo and eventually people to and from the International Space Station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>. These activities pay the bills while the company continues to advance technology towards full reusability and the sophistication needed to take people to Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>.

Musk predicts that sending humans to Mars could become a reality in about 12 years (from 2013), with an aspirational goal of a round trip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>. He also noted that the [[development_of_electric_vehicles_and_teslas_mission | development of electric vehicles]] and [[sustainable_energy_and_future_technology_predictions | sustainable energy]] are progressing faster than many realize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>, with the widespread adoption of new technologies often following an S-curve, being underestimated early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:23">[00:34:23]</a>.

## Related Initiatives

Musk has also teased the "Hyperloop" concept, an ideal transportation system that would be faster (twice as fast), cheaper (half the ticket price), crash-proof, immune to weather, and self-powering with solar panels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:41">[00:44:41]</a>. This concept, similar to evacuated or vacuum tubes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:32">[00:45:32]</a>, was spurred by the disappointing plans for California's high-speed rail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:08">[00:44:08]</a>. He plans to release more details on Hyperloop after Tesla's earnings call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>.

[[Introduction to linear equations | Linear equations]] can be expressed in various forms, but one particularly useful representation for understanding their graphical properties is the [[slopeintercept_form_of_a_linear_equation | slope-intercept form]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This form makes it straightforward to identify both the y-intercept and the [[slope of a line in algebra | slope]] of the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Understanding [[representation_of_linear_equations | Linear Equation Representations]]
A single [[introduction_to_linear_equations | linear equation]] can be represented in an infinite number of ways through algebraic manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. For instance, the equation `y = 2x + 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a> can also be written as ` -2x + y = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a> or `y - 5 = 2(x - 1)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. All these forms are equivalent and can be converted from one to another using algebraic operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

### The [[slopeintercept_form_of_a_linear_equation | Slope-Intercept Form]]
The [[slopeintercept_form_of_a_linear_equation | slope-intercept form]] is typically written as `y = mx + b` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. In this format, `m` represents the [[slope of a line in algebra | slope]] of the line, and `b` represents the y-intercept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

#### Identifying the Y-intercept
The y-intercept is the point where the line crosses the y-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. This occurs when the x-value is zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

Consider the example `y = 2x + 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>:
*   If `x = 0`, then `y = 2(0) + 3`, which simplifies to `y = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   The y-intercept is therefore the point `(0, 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   In [[slopeintercept_form_of_a_linear_equation | slope-intercept form]], the constant term `b` directly indicates the y-intercept's y-coordinate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

#### Identifying the Slope
The [[slope of a line in algebra | slope]] (`m`) indicates the steepness and direction of a line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. It is defined as the [[finding the slope of a line | change in y divided by the change in x]] (`Δy/Δx`) between any two points on the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

Using `y = 2x + 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a> as an example:
*   When `x` increases by `1` (`Δx = 1`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>, the value of `2x` increases by `2`. This means `y` increases by `2` (`Δy = 2`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   The [[slope of a line in algebra | slope]] is `Δy/Δx = 2/1 = 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   In [[slopeintercept_form_of_a_linear_equation | slope-intercept form]], the coefficient of `x` (`m`) is the [[Slope of a Straight Line | slope]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. For `y = 2x + 3`, the [[slope of a line in algebra | slope]] is `2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

#### Practical Application in [[graphing_linear_equations | Graphing Linear Equations]]

The [[slopeintercept_form_of_a_linear_equation | slope-intercept form]] `y = mx + b` is highly intuitive for [[graphical representation of linear equations | graphing linear equations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

Consider the equation `y = -x + 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>:
*   **Y-intercept**: The constant term is `2`, so the y-intercept is `(0, 2)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   **Slope**: The coefficient of `x` is `-1`, so the [[slope of a line in algebra | slope]] is `-1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. This means for every increase of `1` in `x`, `y` decreases by `1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

By identifying the y-intercept and then using the [[interpreting slope from a graph | slope]] to find additional points, one can quickly sketch the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

The hypotenuse is a fundamental concept when working with [[right_triangles_and_their_properties | right triangles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. It is crucial for [[introduction_to_the_pythagorean_theorem | understanding the Pythagorean theorem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a> and its applications, such as [[calculating_the_hypotenuse_and_other_sides | calculating distances between points]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## What is a Right Triangle?

A [[understanding_right_triangles | right triangle]] is a triangle where one of its three internal angles measures exactly 90 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This 90-degree angle, also known as a right angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, is typically indicated by a small square box drawn at its vertex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Defining the Hypotenuse

In a [[right_triangles_and_their_properties | right triangle]], the hypotenuse is defined as:
*   The longest side of the triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   The side located directly opposite the 90-degree (right) angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

The right angle "opens into" the longest side, which is the hypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. In the context of [[introduction_to_the_pythagorean_theorem | the Pythagorean theorem]], the hypotenuse is typically labeled as side 'C' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Identifying the Hypotenuse: Examples

It's essential to correctly identify the hypotenuse before [[applying_the_pythagorean_theorem | applying the Pythagorean theorem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, regardless of the triangle's orientation.

### Example 1: Standard Orientation
Imagine a right triangle where the right angle is at the bottom left. The side opposite this angle, extending from the top vertex to the bottom right vertex, is the hypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### Example 2: Rotated Triangle
Consider a right triangle where the right angle is at the top vertex. The side directly opposite this angle, which forms the base of the triangle, is the hypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

### Example 3: Different Shape
If a right angle is positioned on the left side of the triangle, the side on the right, which it "opens into," will be the hypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

In all cases, the key is to locate the 90-degree angle and then identify the side that does not touch that angle, but is across from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. This will always be the longest side and the hypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

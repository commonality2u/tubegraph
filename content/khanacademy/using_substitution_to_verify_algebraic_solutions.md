One of the benefits of [[using_algebraic_steps_to_solve_equations | solving equations algebraically]] is the ability to check the correctness of an answer by [[substitution_method_for_solving_linear_systems | substituting]] the found value back into the original equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. This process confirms that the solution satisfies the initial conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

## Process of Verification

To verify an algebraic solution:
1.  Take the answer obtained for the variable (e.g., `x`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
2.  [[substitution_method_for_solving_linear_systems | Substitute]] this value back into the original equation, replacing every instance of the variable with the calculated answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
3.  Perform the arithmetic operations on both sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
4.  If the calculations result in both sides of the equation being equal, then the solution is correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

## Example Verification

Consider an equation where `x = -40/39` was found as the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. The original equation was:
`(-3/4)x = 10/13` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>

To verify, [[substitution_method_for_solving_linear_systems | substitute]] `x` with `-40/39`:
`(-3/4) * (-40/39) = 10/13` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>

Perform the multiplication:
*   Note: A negative number multiplied by a negative number yields a positive result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
*   The expression `(-3/4) * (-40/39)` can be simplified by canceling common factors before multiplying:
    *   The `4` in the denominator and `40` in the numerator can be divided by `4` (making `4` into `1` and `40` into `10`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
    *   The `3` in the numerator and `39` in the denominator can be divided by `3` (making `3` into `1` and `39` into `13`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

After simplification, the multiplication becomes:
`(1/1) * (10/13)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>

This yields `10/13` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. Since `10/13` equals `10/13`, the solution is confirmed to be correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

### Another Example

To verify `x = -21/20` for the equation `(-5/6)x = 7/8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>:
1.  [[substitution_method_for_solving_linear_systems | Substitute]] `x` with `-21/20`: `(-5/6) * (-21/20)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
2.  Simplify:
    *   Divide `5` (numerator) and `20` (denominator) by `5` (making `5` into `1` and `20` into `4`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
    *   Divide `6` (denominator) and `21` (numerator) by `3` (making `6` into `2` and `21` into `7`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
    *   A negative times a negative is positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
3.  Multiply the simplified terms: `(1/2) * (7/4) = 7/8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
4.  Since `7/8` equals `7/8`, the solution is correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

This method of [[verifying_solutions_to_differential_equations | verifying solutions]] is a powerful tool to ensure accuracy in [[using_algebraic_steps_to_solve_equations | algebraic problem-solving]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

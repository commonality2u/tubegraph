Algebraic simplification involves applying fundamental ideas to make expressions more concise and manageable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This process often utilizes principles like the [[simplifying_expressions_using_the_distributive_property | distributive property]] and combining like terms.

## Basic Example: Applying the Distributive Property

Consider the expression `2(3x + 5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

This expression literally means two instances of `(3x + 5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. So, it can be written as:
` (3x + 5) + (3x + 5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>

When combined, this results in two `3x` terms and two `5` terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>:
`2(3x) + 2(5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>

This demonstrates the [[simplifying_expressions_using_the_distributive_property | distributive property]], where the number outside the parentheses is multiplied by each term inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

Further simplifying:
`6x + 10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>

## More Involved Example

Let's simplify a more complex expression: `7(3y - 5) - 2(10 + 4y)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### Step 1: Distribute on the Left Side

Apply the [[simplifying_expressions_using_the_distributive_property | distributive property]] to `7(3y - 5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>:
*   `7 * 3y = 21y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>
*   `7 * -5 = -35` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>
*   The left side simplifies to `21y - 35` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### Step 2: Distribute on the Right Side (with Negative Sign)

It is helpful to consider distributing `-2` rather than just `2` to `(10 + 4y)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>:
*   `-2 * 10 = -20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>
*   `-2 * 4y = -8y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>
*   The right side simplifies to `-20 - 8y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### Step 3: Combine Like Terms

Now, the expression is `21y - 35 - 20 - 8y`.
Identify terms with the same variable (`y`) and constant terms:
*   **Combine 'y' terms**:
    *   `21y - 8y = 13y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>
*   **Combine constant terms**:
    *   `-35 - 20 = -55` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>

The fully simplified expression is `13y - 55` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

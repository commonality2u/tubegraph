The [[overview_of_the_electron_transport_chain | electron transport chain]] is a crucial part of [[cellular_respiration_phases | cellular respiration]], responsible for generating the majority of [[electron_transport_chain_and_atp_production | ATP]] (adenosine triphosphate) in cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

## Role in Cellular Respiration

The [[overview_of_the_electron_transport_chain | electron transport chain]] typically occurs after [[cellular_respiration_phases | glycolysis]] and the [[krebs_cycle | Krebs cycle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. It is credited with producing the bulk of [[electron_transport_chain_and_atp_production | ATPs]], approximately 34 [[electron_transport_chain_and_atp_production | ATPs]] in an ideal situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

## Oxygen Requirement

Unlike [[cellular_respiration_phases | glycolysis]], the [[overview_of_the_electron_transport_chain | electron transport chain]] is an [[overview_of_the_electron_transport_chain | aerobic]] process, meaning it requires oxygen to function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. If cells do not receive enough oxygen, this process cannot proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

## Driving Force: NADH and FADH

The [[overview_of_the_electron_transport_chain | electron transport chain]] is primarily driven by [[role_of_nadh_and_fADH2_in_atp_production | NADH]] and [[role_of_nadh_and_fADH2_in_atp_production | FADH]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. During [[cellular_respiration_phases | glycolysis]] and the [[krebs_cycle | Krebs cycle]], NAD+ is converted to [[role_of_nadh_and_fADH2_in_atp_production | NADH]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. For one molecule of glucose, approximately 10 [[role_of_nadh_and_fADH2_in_atp_production | NADHs]] are produced and subsequently utilized in the [[overview_of_the_electron_transport_chain | electron transport chain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. Each [[role_of_nadh_and_fADH2_in_atp_production | NADH]] ideally contributes to the production of three [[electron_transport_chain_and_atp_production | ATPs]] within the [[overview_of_the_electron_transport_chain | electron transport chain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. The molecule [[role_of_nadh_and_fADH2_in_atp_production | FAD]] is also involved, producing [[role_of_nadh_and_fADH2_in_atp_production | FADH]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

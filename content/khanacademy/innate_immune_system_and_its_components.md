The innate immune system, also known as the nonspecific immune system, is the body's first line of defense against pathogens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. It is considered "nonspecific" because it does not distinguish between different types of viruses, proteins, or bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Instead, it identifies general characteristics of foreign invaders, such as the presence of double-stranded DNA typically found in viruses, and acts to eliminate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This system is present across many species and organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Components of the Innate Immune System

The innate immune system is divided into two primary lines of defense:

### First Line Barriers

These are physical and chemical barriers that prevent pathogens from entering the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Examples include:
*   Skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>
*   Stomach acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>
*   The acidity of oils on the skin's surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>

### Second Line of Defense

If pathogens manage to breach the first line, the second line of defense, which is still nonspecific, comes into play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Key components include:

#### Inflammatory Response
The [[cellular_mechanisms_of_inflammation | inflammatory response]] is a crucial part of the innate immune system, designed to bring immune cells and molecules to the site of infection or injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

#### Phagocytes
[[Role of phagocytes in the immune response | Phagocytes]] are specialized white blood cells (leukocytes) that engulf and destroy foreign invaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. They act nonspecifically, meaning they consume anything they perceive as "shady" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

Examples of phagocytes discussed include:
*   [[Role of mast cells and dendritic cells | Dendritic cells]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>
*   Macrophages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>
*   Neutrophils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>

All of these phagocytic cells are types of white blood cells, also known as leukocytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### Distinction from Specific (Adaptive) Immune System
The innate immune system operates without prior exposure to a specific pathogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. In contrast, the specific, or [[difference_between_innate_and_adaptive_immune_systems | adaptive immune system]], is a newer adaptation thought to be particular to humans, and relies on previous exposure to develop resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. The main actors in the specific immune system are [[functions_of_lymphocytes_b_and_t_cells | lymphocytes]], which are also types of leukocytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. While phagocytes are largely nonspecific, both phagocytes and lymphocytes are classified as white blood cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

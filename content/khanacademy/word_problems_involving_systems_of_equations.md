This article focuses on an algebraic technique for [[solving_linear_equations|solving systems of equations]], specifically the [[substitution_method_for_solving_linear_systems|substitution method]], which provides an exact answer without needing to graph the lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. It builds upon the concept of a [[introduction_to_systems_of_equations|system of equations]] introduced previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## The Substitution Method

The [[substitution_method_for_solving_linear_systems|substitution method]] involves using one of the equations to solve for one of the variables, and then substituting that expression back into the other equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This reduces the [[systematic_approach_to_solving_equations|system of equations]] to a single equation with one unknown, which can then be solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### Example 1: Solving a System Algebraically

Consider the following [[introduction_to_systems_of_equations|system of equations]]:
1.  `x + 2y = 9` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
2.  `3x + 5y = 20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>

Traditionally, one might use a [[graphical_interpretation_of_systems_of_equations|graphical interpretation of systems of equations]] to find the intersection point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, but this can be inexact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

#### Steps for Solution:

1.  **Solve one equation for one variable:**
    From equation 1 (`x + 2y = 9`), subtract `2y` from both sides to solve for `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>:
    `x = 9 - 2y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>

2.  **Substitute the expression into the other equation:**
    Substitute `(9 - 2y)` for `x` in equation 2 (`3x + 5y = 20`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>:
    `3 * (9 - 2y) + 5y = 20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>

3.  **Solve the resulting single-variable equation:**
    *   Distribute the 3: `27 - 6y + 5y = 20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>
    *   Combine like terms: `27 - y = 20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>
    *   Subtract 27 from both sides: `-y = 20 - 27` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>
    *   `-y = -7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>
    *   Multiply by -1: `y = 7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>

4.  **Substitute the found value back into the expression from step 1 to find the other variable:**
    Using `x = 9 - 2y` and `y = 7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>:
    `x = 9 - 2 * (7)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>
    `x = 9 - 14` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>
    `x = -5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>

#### Solution Verification:
The solution is `x = -5` and `y = 7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   For `x + 2y = 9`: `-5 + 2(7) = -5 + 14 = 9` (True) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>
*   For `3x + 5y = 20`: `3(-5) + 5(7) = -15 + 35 = 20` (True) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>

If graphed, these lines would intersect at the point `(-5, 7)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

## Interpreting and Solving Word Problems with Systems of Equations

The [[substitution_method_for_solving_linear_systems|substitution method]] is particularly useful for [[interpreting_and_solving_word_problems_with_systems_of_equations|interpreting and solving word problems with systems of equations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. The key is to define variables and translate the problem's statements into algebraic equations.

### Example 2: Sum and Difference of Two Numbers

**Problem:** The sum of two numbers is 70, and they differ by 11. What are the numbers? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>

#### Steps for Solution:

1.  **Define variables:**
    *   Let `x` be the larger number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
    *   Let `y` be the smaller number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

2.  **Translate statements into equations:**
    *   "The sum of two numbers is 70": `x + y = 70` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>
    *   "They differ by 11": `x - y = 11` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>

3.  **Solve the resulting [[introduction_to_systems_of_equations|system of equations]] using the [[substitution_method_for_solving_linear_systems|substitution method]]:**
    *   From the second equation (`x - y = 11`), solve for `x`:
        Add `y` to both sides: `x = 11 + y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
    *   Substitute this expression for `x` into the first equation (`x + y = 70`):
        `(11 + y) + y = 70` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>
    *   Solve the resulting equation for `y`:
        `11 + 2y = 70` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>
        Subtract 11 from both sides: `2y = 59` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>
        Divide by 2: `y = 59/2` or `y = 29.5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>
    *   Substitute the value of `y` back into `x = 11 + y` to find `x`:
        `x = 11 + 29.5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>
        `x = 40.5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>

#### Solution Verification:
The two numbers are 40.5 and 29.5.
*   **Sum:** `40.5 + 29.5 = 70` (True) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>
*   **Difference:** `40.5 - 29.5 = 11` (True) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>

The key to solving a [[systematic_approach_to_solving_equations|system of equations]] is to use all given constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

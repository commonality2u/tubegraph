Word problems involving [[systems_of_equations | systems of equations]] require translating real-world scenarios into mathematical expressions and then using algebraic methods to find solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. These problems typically involve multiple unknown quantities that are related to each other through several conditions.

## General Approach

Solving [[word_problems_in_algebra | word problems]] with [[systems_of_equations | systems of equations]] generally follows these steps:

1.  **Define Variables**
    *   Identify the unknown quantities in the problem and assign a unique variable (e.g., x, y) to each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. It's often helpful to write down what each variable represents.
2.  **Formulate Equations**
    *   Translate the given information and conditions into a set of linear equations. Each distinct piece of information often corresponds to one equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
3.  **Solve the System**
    *   Use a suitable method to solve the [[systems_of_equations | system of equations]] for the values of the defined variables. Common methods include:
        *   [[solving_linear_systems_by_substitution | Substitution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>
        *   [[solving_systems_of_equations | Elimination]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>
        *   [[visualization_techniques_in_solving_equations | Graphing]] (though often less precise for exact numerical solutions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>
4.  **Verify the Solution**
    *   Plug the found variable values back into the original equations to ensure they satisfy all conditions of the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## Example: Candy Store Purchase

Consider the following problem:
*   Nadia buys 3 candy bars and 4 Fruit Roll-Ups for $2.84 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   Peter buys 3 candy bars and 1 Fruit Roll-Up for $1.79 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   What is the cost of each candy bar and each Fruit Roll-Up? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>

### Step 1: Define Variables

Let:
*   `x` = cost of a candy bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>
*   `y` = cost of a Fruit Roll-Up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>

### Step 2: Formulate Equations

From Nadia's purchase:
*   `3x + 4y = 2.84` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>

From Peter's purchase:
*   `3x + 1y = 1.79` (or `3x + y = 1.79`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>

This creates a [[systems_of_equations | system of equations]]:
1.  `3x + 4y = 2.84`
2.  `3x + y = 1.79`

### Step 3: Solve the System (using [[solving_systems_of_equations | Elimination]])

The goal of [[solving_systems_of_equations | elimination]] is to add or subtract the equations in a way that eliminates one variable, leaving a single equation with one variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

Notice that both equations have `3x`. Subtracting the second equation from the first will eliminate `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
When subtracting one equation from another, you are essentially adding the negative of the second equation to the first. This is valid because you are adding equal quantities to both sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

Subtract Equation (2) from Equation (1):
`(3x + 4y) - (3x + y) = 2.84 - 1.79` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>

Distribute the negative sign:
`3x + 4y - 3x - y = 2.84 - 1.79` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>

Combine like terms:
` (3x - 3x) + (4y - y) = 1.05 ` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>
`0x + 3y = 1.05` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>
`3y = 1.05` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>

Now, [[solving_simple_linear_equations | solve for y]]:
`y = 1.05 / 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>
`y = 0.35` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>

So, the cost of a Fruit Roll-Up is $0.35 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

Next, [[solving_equations_with_variables | substitute]] the value of `y` into either of the original equations to [[solving_equations_with_variables | solve for x]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Using the second equation (`3x + y = 1.79`):
`3x + 0.35 = 1.79` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>

[[Solving equations with variables on both sides | Subtract]] 0.35 from both sides:
`3x = 1.79 - 0.35` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>
`3x = 1.44` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>

[[Solving simple linear equations | Solve for x]]:
`x = 1.44 / 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>
`x = 0.48` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>

So, the cost of a candy bar is $0.48 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

### Step 4: Verify the Solution

*   **Nadia's purchase:** `3($0.48) + 4($0.35) = $1.44 + $1.40 = $2.84`. This matches the given information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.
*   **Peter's purchase:** `3($0.48) + 1($0.35) = $1.44 + $0.35 = $1.79`. This matches the given information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

The solution satisfies both equations, confirming that a candy bar costs $0.48 and a Fruit Roll-Up costs $0.35 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

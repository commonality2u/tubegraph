[[overview_of_glycolysis | Glycolysis]] is a crucial biochemical pathway found in nearly all forms of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Its primary function is to break down glucose into two pyruvate molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Glucose is a six-carbon molecule, while each pyruvate is a three-carbon molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This process involves distinct phases where [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATP]] is either consumed (investment) or produced (payoff), leading to a net gain of ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Investment Phase

The initial stage of [[glycolysis_phases_and_process | glycolysis]] is known as the [[glycolysis_phases_and_process | investment phase]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, during which [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATP]] is utilized to prepare the glucose molecule for subsequent breakdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Two molecules of ATP are consumed in this phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### Phosphorylation of Glucose

The first step involves the phosphorylation of glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. An [[functional_steps_and_enzymes_involved_in_glycolysis | enzyme]] called Hexokinase facilitates this reaction, attaching a phosphate group to glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This process consumes one ATP molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Hexokinases often use a magnesium ion as a co-factor to help lower the activation energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. The reaction is strongly favored from left to right due to the coupling of glucose phosphorylation, which requires free energy, with ATP hydrolysis, which releases free energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

### Phosphorylation of Fructose 6-Phosphate

Following an isomerization step where glucose 6-phosphate is converted to fructose 6-phosphate by phosphoglucose isomerase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>, another strong forward reaction occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. The [[functional_steps_and_enzymes_involved_in_glycolysis | enzyme]] Phosphofructokinase uses another ATP molecule to attach a second phosphate group to fructose 6-phosphate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>, forming fructose 1,6-bisphosphate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. This also involves a magnesium co-factor to stabilize negative charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. This is the second ATP consumed in the [[glycolysis_phases_and_process | investment phase]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

## Payoff Phase

After the initial investment, [[glycolysis_phases_and_process | glycolysis]] enters the [[glycolysis_phases_and_process | payoff phase]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>, where [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATP]] is produced. At this point, the six-carbon molecule (derived from glucose) has been broken into two three-carbon chains: glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and another isomer that is converted into glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. Therefore, subsequent reactions effectively happen twice for each initial glucose molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

### First ATP Production

A phosphate group is added to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, and simultaneously, NAD+ is reduced to [[nad_reduction_to_nadh_during_glycolysis | NADH]] by a dehydrogenase [[functional_steps_and_enzymes_involved_in_glycolysis | enzyme]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. This [[role_of_nad_and_nadh_in_glycolysis | NADH]] can be used later in the electron transport chain to produce more [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
Subsequently, the [[functional_steps_and_enzymes_involved_in_glycolysis | enzyme]] Phosphoglycerate Kinase removes one of the phosphate groups from 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (the molecule formed in the previous step) and transfers it to ADP, producing ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Since this occurs for both three-carbon molecules, a total of two ATPs are produced in this step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

### Second ATP Production

After a mutase [[functional_steps_and_enzymes_involved_in_glycolysis | enzyme]] shifts the phosphate group on the molecule from carbon 3 to carbon 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>, and an enolase acts on the molecule, Pyruvate Kinase performs the final ATP-generating step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. This [[functional_steps_and_enzymes_involved_in_glycolysis | enzyme]] dephosphorylates phosphoenolpyruvate, converting ADP to ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. As this also happens for both three-carbon chains, another two ATP molecules are produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. This reaction results in the formation of pyruvate, which marks the end of mainstream [[glycolysis_phases_and_process | glycolysis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

## Net ATP Yield

In summary, [[overall_equation_and_net_energy_yield_of_glycolysis | glycolysis]] starts with an investment of two ATP molecules and then produces four ATP molecules in the payoff phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, resulting in a [[overall_equation_and_net_energy_yield_of_glycolysis | net yield]] of two ATP molecules directly from the pathway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Additionally, two molecules of [[role_of_nad_and_nadh_in_glycolysis | NAD+]] are reduced to two [[role_of_nad_and_nadh_in_glycolysis | NADH]] molecules, which can later generate more ATP through the electron transport chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

For every glucose molecule, the [[overall_equation_and_net_energy_yield_of_glycolysis | overall equation and net energy yield of glycolysis]] is:
*   **Used:** 2 ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>
*   **Produced:** 4 ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>
*   **Net:** +2 ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>
*   **Also produced:** 2 [[nad_reduction_to_nadh_during_glycolysis | NADH]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>
*   **Final product:** 2 Pyruvate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>

[[impact_of_glycolysis_in_cellular_respiration | Glycolysis]] is the initial step of [[stages_of_cellular_respiration | cellular respiration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. If oxygen is available, its products move into the mitochondria for further processes like the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. In the absence of oxygen, cells undergo anaerobic respiration or fermentation, primarily to regenerate NAD+ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

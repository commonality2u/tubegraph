At any given point, there is always "something wrong" in Tesla's car production due to the sheer volume of processes involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, as stated by Elon Musk. Manufacturing a car involves thousands of individual and unique components, and the absence of even one small part can halt production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This constant stream of problems is a core aspect of [[the_business_and_challenges_of_entrepreneurship | the business and challenges of entrepreneurship]] in the automotive sector.

## The $3 USB Cable Fiasco
One specific example of a production challenge involved a missing $3 USB cable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   **Impact on Production** The absence of this single, inexpensive component meant that cars could not be completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, causing the entire production line to stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. The cable is part of the wiring harness, without which the car's interior cannot be installed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Building cars without the interior would lead to significant inefficiency, requiring hundreds of cars to be stored and later worked on in a non-moving production environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   **Supply Chain Breakdown** The primary supplier for this cable is located in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
    *   **Plan A Failure:** The supplier grouped Tesla's parts with other companies' items, sending them via a slow boat to Los Angeles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Upon arrival, the other items failed customs, preventing Tesla's parts from being released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, causing a delay of a couple of weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. This highlights the complexities of [[market_shortages_and_surpluses | market shortages and surpluses]] and global supply chains.
    *   **Plan B Failure:** To address the immediate shortage, Tesla contacted the supplier's U.S. subsidiary to air freight the cables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. However, this second order exceeded Tesla's credit limit with the supplier, causing the shipment to be bounced and not shipped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Temporary Solution** To continue production, Tesla had to dispatch employees throughout the Bay Area to manually purchase USB cables from local stores like Fry's, effectively buying out their stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. This action allowed production to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Systemic Challenges
Musk emphasizes that the USB cable incident is just one example, and "many things like that" occur frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This constant need to address emergent issues is a defining characteristic of high-volume manufacturing and highlights the challenges in maintaining [[efficiency_in_production | efficiency in production]].

In the context of [[the_business_and_challenges_of_entrepreneurship | entrepreneurship]], Musk describes starting a company as "staring into the abyss and eating glass" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>. For a CEO, this means constantly dealing with the "worst problems" that others cannot solve, leading to high stress and a need for a high pain threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:26">[00:40:26]</a>. The daily focus is often on preventing the company's "extermination" rather than purely on long-term vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:11">[00:41:11]</a>.

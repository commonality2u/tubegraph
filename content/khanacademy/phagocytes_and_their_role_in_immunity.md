Phagocytes are a crucial component of the body's [[immune_system_mechanisms_during_inflammation|immune system]], primarily acting as a second line of defense against pathogens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Definition and Function
Phagocytes are cells that engulf and destroy foreign invaders within the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Their primary function is to identify and eliminate potentially harmful substances by "eating them up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## Nonspecific Immunity
Phagocytes are part of the [[Innate immune system|nonspecific]] or [[Innate immune system|innate immune system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This means they do not recognize specific types of viruses, proteins, or bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Instead, they identify general "shady" characteristics of invaders, such as the presence of double-stranded DNA (found in some viruses), and proceed to engulf them without needing prior exposure or specific recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. This [[Innate immune system|nonspecific]] defense mechanism is common across many species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## Types of Phagocytes
All phagocytes are a type of [[cellular_actors_in_inflammation|white blood cell]], also known as leukocytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Examples of phagocytes include:
*   Dendritic cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>
*   Macrophages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>
*   Neutrophils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>

While all these are [[cellular_actors_in_inflammation|white blood cells]], not all [[cellular_actors_in_inflammation|white blood cells]] are phagocytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Lymphocytes, for instance, are another type of [[cellular_actors_in_inflammation|white blood cell]] involved in the [[Adaptive immune system|specific immune system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

Phagocytes can also play a role in the [[Adaptive immune system|specific immune system]] by presenting antigens, though their primary engulfing role is [[Innate immune system|nonspecific]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

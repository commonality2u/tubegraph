Logarithms are fundamentally about determining the power to which a base must be raised to obtain a given number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Understanding Logarithms

An [[introduction_to_logarithms | introduction to logarithms]] often begins by revisiting exponents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. For example, if you raise 2 to the fourth power, it means 2 multiplied by itself 4 times, resulting in 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

The [[inverse_relationship_between_logarithms_and_exponents | inverse relationship between logarithms and exponents]] allows us to ask: "If we start with 2, and we want to get 16, what power do we have to raise 2 to?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a> In this case, the power would be 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

### Logarithm Notation

The [[logarithm_notation | logarithm notation]] expresses this question concisely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The statement "what power do I need to raise 2 to, to get 16?" is written as:

```
log base 2 of 16 = x
```

This is equivalent to the exponential statement:

```
2^x = 16
```

In both cases, 'x' equals 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

[[evaluating_logarithmic_expressions | Evaluating logarithmic expressions]] involves finding this exponent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. For instance:

*   **log base 3 of 81**: This asks what power 3 must be raised to to get 81 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
    *   3^1 = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>
    *   3^2 = 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>
    *   3^3 = 27 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>
    *   3^4 = 81 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>
    *   So, log base 3 of 81 = 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **log base 6 of 216**: This asks what power 6 must be raised to to get 216 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
    *   6^1 = 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>
    *   6^2 = 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>
    *   6^3 = 216 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>
    *   So, log base 6 of 216 = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

## The Logarithm of One

One notable special case in [[logarithm properties and rules | logarithms]] involves finding the logarithm of the number 1.

Consider the expression:

```
log base 100 of 1
```

This asks: "What power do I have to raise 100 to, to get to 1?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>

If we set this equal to 'x', the equation becomes:

```
100^x = 1
```

The only exponent 'x' that satisfies this equation is 0, because any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 equals 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

Therefore:

```
log base 100 of 1 = 0
```

### General Rule

This observation leads to a general rule:

> [!rule] Logarithm of One
> Logarithm base anything (that is not 0) of 1, is always equal to 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
>
> In general form:
> `log base b of 1 = 0`
>
> Provided that the base `b` is not equal to 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

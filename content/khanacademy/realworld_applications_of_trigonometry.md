While the immediate real-world applications are not fully explored in this introductory video, [[introduction_to_trigonometry | trigonometry]] primarily deals with the study of [[trigonometric_functions_and_right_triangles | right triangles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. It examines the relationship between the sides and angles within a [[trigonometric_functions_and_right_triangles | right triangle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Core Utility
The primary utility of [[trigonometric_functions_definition_for_right_triangles | trig functions]] is to provide ratios of the sides of a triangle relative to a specific angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This capability allows one to determine unknown information about a [[trigonometric_functions_and_right_triangles | right triangle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

## Practical Applications
*   **Calculating Unknown Values** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>:
    *   If you know the sides of a [[trigonometric_functions_and_right_triangles | triangle]], you can calculate its angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
    *   If you know an angle and a side, you can calculate the lengths of other sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   **Calculator Functions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>: Understanding [[introduction_to_trigonometry | trigonometry]] helps in comprehending the purpose of [[trigonometric_functions_sine_cosine_and_tangent | sine]], [[trigonometric_functions_sine_cosine_and_tangent | cosine]], and [[trigonometric_functions_sine_cosine_and_tangent | tangent]] buttons on a calculator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

Further examples demonstrating these applications are to be covered in subsequent lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

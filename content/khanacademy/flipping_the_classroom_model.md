From: [[khanacademy]] <br/> 

The "flipping the classroom" model is an innovative educational approach that redefines where and when students engage with lectures and practice exercises. This model leverages online educational resources, such as those provided by [[Khan Academy and online education | Khan Academy]], to optimize in-class time for interactive learning and personalized support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:11">[06:09:11]</a>.

## Origin and Concept

The concept emerged when teachers began using [[Khan Academy and online education | Khan Academy]] videos to "flip the classroom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:11">[06:09:11]</a>. Instead of delivering lectures in person, teachers assigned video lectures as homework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:21">[06:18:21]</a>. The time traditionally used for homework was then spent in the classroom, with students working on exercises and collaborating with peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>.

The core idea is to remove the "one size fits all" lecture from the classroom, allowing students to experience [[personalized_learning_approaches | self-paced lectures]] at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:03">[06:52:03]</a>. When students come to class, they engage in problem-solving and activities, with the teacher providing individual support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>.

## Benefits of Flipping the Classroom

### For Students

*   **Self-Paced Learning**: Students can pause and repeat lecture videos as needed without feeling like they are wasting the teacher's time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. They can review concepts from weeks or years prior without embarrassment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.
*   **Reduced Pressure**: When learning a new concept, the pressure of a human asking "do you understand this?" is removed, allowing students to learn in the "intimacy of their own room" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.
*   **Mastery-Based Progression**: Unlike traditional models where classes move on after a snapshot exam regardless of individual mastery, the flipped model (especially with accompanying exercises) encourages students to achieve "10 in a row" success before advancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>. This prevents "Swiss cheese gaps" in foundational knowledge that can lead to failure in later subjects like algebra or calculus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>. This approach encourages experimentation and failure on the path to mastery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:00">[09:45:00]</a>.

### For Teachers and the Classroom Environment

*   **Humanizing Education**: By offloading lectures, technology is used to [[humanizing_the_classroom | humanize the classroom]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>. The teacher's role shifts from delivering "one size fits all" lectures to facilitating interaction and providing targeted support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>. This increases the "student to valuable human time with the teacher" ratio from potentially 5% to 100% of the teacher's time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:06:00">[15:06:00]</a>.
*   **Data-Driven Insights**: Teachers are armed with detailed [[datadriven_insights_in_education | data-driven insights]] into student progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:00">[12:42:00]</a>. Dashboards can show which students are proficient, working on a concept, or stuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>. This allows teachers to intervene precisely where needed or even have proficient students tutor their peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>. Data can include how long students spend daily, which videos they watch, where they pause, and specific problems they got right or wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>.
*   **Challenging Labels**: When students are allowed to work at their own pace, the traditional labels of "gifted" or "slow" become less relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:57:00">[13:57:00]</a>. Students who take longer on one concept may race ahead on others, demonstrating that perceived abilities are often "due to a coincidence of time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:08:00">[14:08:00]</a>. This reinforces the [[universality_of_learning_capability | universality of learning capability]].

## Implementation: The Los Altos Pilot Program

The Los Altos School District implemented the flipped classroom model in two fifth-grade and two seventh-grade classes, completely overhauling their math curriculum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>.

*   Students did not use textbooks or receive "one size fits all" lectures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:00">[11:22:00]</a>.
*   They spent about half their math class using the [[Khan Academy and online education | Khan Academy]] software, which freed up time for more engaging activities like simulations, games, robot building, and real-world estimation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>.
*   Teachers monitored progress through a live dashboard, identifying students who needed help (marked red) or could assist peers (marked green) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a>.
*   The system provided continuity of data, allowing tracking of student progress through summers and across different teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:34:00">[18:34:00]</a>.

## Global Vision

The flipped classroom model, enabled by online resources like [[Khan Academy and online education | Khan Academy]], aims to impact education on a [[global_education_and_accessibility | global scale]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:42:00">[14:42:00]</a>. It offers immense value to adult learners who may be embarrassed to relearn basic concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22:00">[15:22:00]</a>, and to individuals in challenging circumstances, such as a street kid in Calcutta who can learn at their own pace without school attendance barriers or embarrassment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:35:00">[15:35:00]</a>. This system also facilitates peer-to-peer tutoring beyond the classroom, potentially creating a "global one world classroom" where students from different continents can learn from each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:58:00">[15:58:00]</a>.

## Motivation and Engagement

[[Khan Academy and online education | Khan Academy]] incorporates game mechanics to motivate learners, including earning badges, points, and appearing on leaderboards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:23:00">[17:23:00]</a>. The wording of badges and point allocation can significantly influence student engagement and direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:31:00">[17:31:00]</a>.

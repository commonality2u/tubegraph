From: [[khanacademy]] <br/> 
The "Flipping the Classroom" model is an educational approach that reverses traditional teaching methods by having students engage with lecture content at home and then practice concepts and interact with peers and teachers in the classroom. This model was significantly championed and popularized by [[Khan Academy and its educational impact | Khan Academy]].

### Core Concept
In the flipped classroom model, lectures are assigned as homework, often through video content, allowing students to learn new material at their own pace outside of class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. This frees up classroom time for what traditionally would have been homework or practice sessions, enabling more interactive and personalized learning experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

### Origins
The concept emerged organically when Salman Khan, while tutoring his cousins remotely, began posting his lessons on YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. His cousins expressed a preference for learning from the YouTube videos rather than in-person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. This seemingly "backhanded" feedback revealed a profound insight: students could pause and repeat the lessons without embarrassment, review past concepts freely, and learn at their own [[personalized_and_selfpaced_learning | pace]] and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Crucially, it removed the pressure of a human asking "do you understand this" while a student was trying to grasp a new concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

Teachers later began adopting these videos to "flip" their classrooms, assigning the lectures for homework and dedicating class time to problem-solving and interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

### Benefits and Impact
*   **[[personalized_and_selfpaced_learning | Personalized and Self-Paced Learning]]:** Students can consume content at their optimal speed, pausing, rewatching, or skipping ahead as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. This addresses the "one-size-fits-all" limitation of traditional lectures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
*   **Humanizing the Classroom:** By moving lectures outside, classroom time becomes focused on interaction, collaboration, and individual support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. Teachers can walk around, engage students directly, and facilitate peer-to-peer interaction, transforming a "dehumanizing" experience into a "human experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   **Addressing Learning Gaps:** The model supports mastery learning, where students must achieve proficiency (e.g., 10 correct answers in a row) before moving to the next concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. This prevents "Swiss cheese gaps" in foundational knowledge that often lead to struggles in more advanced topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.
*   **Teacher Empowerment:** Teachers gain insights into student progress via dashboards, identifying exactly where students are stuck (e.g., "red" students) and allowing for targeted interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. They can also leverage proficient students to tutor peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. This increases the "student to valuable human time with the teacher" ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.
*   **Challenging Labels:** Observations from flipped classrooms show that students who initially take more time on certain concepts often "race ahead" later, blurring traditional distinctions between "gifted" and "slow" learners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.

### Technology and Data
[[Online learning and technology in education | Technology]] is central to the flipped classroom model, especially in the [[Khan Academy and its educational impact | Khan Academy]] context. The platform provides:
*   **Extensive Video Library:** Over 2,200 videos covering topics from basic arithmetic to vector calculus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **Practice Exercises:** Adaptive exercises that generate new questions until mastery is achieved (e.g., 10 in a row) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
*   **Knowledge Map:** A structured progression of concepts, starting from fundamental ideas (e.g., single-digit addition) and leading to advanced topics (e.g., calculus, computer programming, genetics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
*   **[[datadriven_teaching_strategies | Data-Driven Dashboards]]:** Provide teachers with granular data on student activity, including time spent, videos watched, exercises used, and specific problems answered correctly or incorrectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. This allows for precise diagnosis and targeted intervention.
*   **Gamification:** Incorporation of game mechanics like badges, points, and leaderboards to motivate students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.

### Real-World Application
The flipped classroom model has been piloted in schools, such as two fifth-grade and two seventh-grade classes in the Los Altos school district, where traditional math curricula were replaced with [[Khan Academy and its educational impact | Khan Academy]]'s approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. This freed up time for teachers to focus on simulations, hands-on activities, and real-world problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

### Future Vision
The potential of the flipped classroom extends beyond individual classrooms. With the ability to track student progress over time, even across different teachers and during summer breaks, a continuous data stream provides insights into learning trajectories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.

Furthermore, the model supports a broader vision of a global classroom and [[the_universality_of_learning | universal learning]], where:
*   Adult learners can revisit foundational concepts without embarrassment before pursuing higher education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.
*   Individuals in challenging circumstances, such as a street kid in Calcutta, can access educational content at their convenience and catch up without feeling ashamed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.
*   Peer-to-peer tutoring can occur on a global scale, connecting students across different countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. This fosters the idea of a "global one world classroom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

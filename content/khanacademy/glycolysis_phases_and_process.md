[[glycolysis_and_its_role_in_cellular_respiration | Glycolysis]] is the first of three main [[stages_of_cellular_respiration | phases in cellular respiration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The term "glycolysis" literally translates to the "breaking down of glucose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Role in Cellular Respiration

[[overview_of_glycolysis | Glycolysis]] can occur with or without oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Without Oxygen**: If oxygen is absent, the process proceeds to fermentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. In humans, this produces lactic acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, while other organisms might produce alcohol or ethanol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **With Oxygen**: If oxygen is present, which is generally assumed for the continuation of cellular respiration, [[glycolysis_and_its_role_in_cellular_respiration | glycolysis]] proceeds to the Krebs cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, and then to the electron transport chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The bulk of [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATP]] is produced in the electron transport chain, using raw materials from earlier phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

[[impact_of_glycolysis_in_cellular_respiration | Glycolysis]] is the initial step that begins with glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, which has a chemical formula of C6H12O6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Glucose is a six-carbon molecule, which can exist as a ring, but for simplicity is often viewed as six carbons in a row <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

## [[ATP investment and payoff phases in glycolysis | Phases of Glycolysis]]

[[overview_of_glycolysis | Glycolysis]] consists of two main phases: the [[atp_investment_and_payoff_phases_in_glycolysis | investment phase]] and the [[atp_investment_and_payoff_phases_in_glycolysis | payoff phase]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

### [[atp_investment_and_payoff_phases_in_glycolysis | Investment Phase]]
The [[atp_investment_and_payoff_phases_in_glycolysis | investment phase]] uses two [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATP]] molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. This initial [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATP]] expenditure is necessary to break glucose into two 3-carbon compounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. These compounds, often called PGAL or phosphoglyceraldehyde, receive phosphate groups from the [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATP]] molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This phase uses two [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATP]]s, as an investment for later energy generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

### [[atp_investment_and_payoff_phases_in_glycolysis | Payoff Phase]]
Each of the two PGAL molecules proceeds into the [[atp_investment_and_payoff_phases_in_glycolysis | payoff phase]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. In this phase, each PGAL molecule is converted into pyruvate, which is also a 3-carbon compound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. This conversion of PGAL to pyruvate yields two main products for *each* PGAL molecule:
*   **Two [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATP]]s**: For each PGAL, two [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATP]] molecules are produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Since there are two PGALs, a total of four [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATP]]s are generated in this phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
*   **One [[role_of_nad_and_nadh_in_glycolysis | NADH]]**: Each PGAL also produces one [[role_of_nad_and_nadh_in_glycolysis | NADH]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. This occurs as NAD+ is reduced by gaining a hydrogen, effectively gaining electrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. These [[role_of_nad_and_nadh_in_glycolysis | NADH]] molecules are later used in the electron transport chain to produce additional [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATP]]s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Since there are two PGALs, a total of two [[role_of_nad_and_nadh_in_glycolysis | NADH]]s are produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

The final product of [[glycolysis_and_its_role_in_cellular_respiration | glycolysis]] is two molecules of pyruvate for every molecule of glucose that began the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### [[overall_equation_and_net_energy_yield_of_glycolysis | Net Energy Yield]]:
From one glucose molecule, [[glycolysis_and_its_role_in_cellular_respiration | glycolysis]] yields:
*   **Net 2 [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATP]]s**: (4 produced - 2 invested) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>
*   **2 [[role_of_nad_and_nadh_in_glycolysis | NADH]]s**: These can later generate approximately 3 [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATP]]s each in the electron transport chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.
*   **2 Pyruvates**: These are subsequently re-engineered into acetyl-CoAs, serving as raw materials for the Krebs cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

## [[functional_steps_and_enzymes_involved_in_glycolysis | Detailed Process Overview]]

While the full mechanism can be daunting, understanding the major transformations helps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
*   **Glucose phosphorylation**: Glucose, a six-carbon ring, is phosphorylated using [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
*   **Splitting of glucose**: The glucose molecule is split into two 3-carbon compounds, such as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (also known as phosphoglyceraldehyde or PGAL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. Each of these molecules has a phosphate group attached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
*   **Energy Generation**: As these two 3-carbon compounds proceed through the [[atp_investment_and_payoff_phases_in_glycolysis | payoff phase]], [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATP]] is generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. For each of the two PGALs, two [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATP]]s are produced, leading to a gross production of four [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATP]]s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.
*   **[[role_of_nad_and_nadh_in_glycolysis | NADH]] Production**: Also in the [[atp_investment_and_payoff_phases_in_glycolysis | payoff phase]], NAD+ is reduced to [[role_of_nad_and_nadh_in_glycolysis | NADH]] for each of the two PGAL molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.
*   **Pyruvate Formation**: The final product is pyruvate, a 3-carbon structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. The carbon backbone of glucose is split in half and undergoes oxidation, meaning hydrogens are stripped off, and carbons bond more strongly with oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Simplifying [[functional_steps_and_enzymes_involved_in_glycolysis | functional steps and enzymes involved in glycolysis]]: The individual enzymes and intermediate steps of [[glycolysis_and_its_role_in_cellular_respiration | glycolysis]] are complex, but the core concepts of [[atp_investment_and_payoff_phases_in_glycolysis | ATP investment and payoff]], [[role_of_nad_and_nadh_in_glycolysis | NADH]] production, and glucose splitting are key takeaways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

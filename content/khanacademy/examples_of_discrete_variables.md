[[Random Variables | Random variables]] come in two main varieties: [[Discrete Random Variables | discrete random variables]] and [[Continuous Random Variables | continuous random variables]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This article focuses on [[Discrete Random Variables | discrete random variables]].

## Defining Discrete Random Variables
[[Discrete random variables]] are defined as [[Random Variables | random variables]] that can take on distinct or separate values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This definition aligns with the English meaning of "discrete" as distinct or separate values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. It's important to note that this is not referring to the common meaning of "polite" or "subtle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

A key characteristic of [[Discrete Random Variables | discrete random variables]] is that you can count the number of different values they can take on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. While often dealing with a finite number of values, a [[Discrete Random Variables | discrete random variable]] can also have an infinite number of potential values, as long as those values are countable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. This means you can theoretically list them, even if the list is infinite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

## Examples

### Coin Flip Outcome
Consider a [[Random Variables | random variable]] `X` defined as:
*   `X = 1` if a fair coin is heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>
*   `X = 0` if a fair coin is tails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>

This is a [[Discrete Random Variables | discrete random variable]] because it can only take on two distinct values: `1` or `0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. These values are countable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### Student Birth Year
Let [[Random Variables | random variable]] `Y` be "the year that a random student in the class was born" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
This is a [[Discrete Random Variables | discrete random variable]] because the year can be defined as a specific, distinct year, such as 1992, 1985, or 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. It cannot take on any value between two years (e.g., between 2000 and 2001) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. The possible values are countable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

### Number of Ants Born in the Universe
Consider [[Random Variables | random variable]] `Z` as "the number of ants born tomorrow in the universe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
This is a [[Discrete Random Variables | discrete random variable]] because the number of ants can be counted: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 quadrillion, or 5 quadrillion and 1, etc. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. These values are discrete and countable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

### Olympic Sprint Time (Rounded)
Let [[Random Variables | random variable]] `X` be "the winning time for the men's 100-meter dash at the 2016 Olympics rounded to the nearest hundredth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.
This is a [[Discrete Random Variables | discrete random variable]] because, once rounded, the possible values become countable and listable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. For example, it could be 9.56 seconds, 9.57 seconds, or 9.58 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
It's important to contrast this with the "exact winning time," which would be a [[Continuous Random Variables | continuous random variable]] because it could theoretically take on any value within an interval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

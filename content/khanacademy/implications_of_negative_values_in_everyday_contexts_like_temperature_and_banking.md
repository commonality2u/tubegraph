While initially appearing "deep and mysterious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negative numbers]] are commonly encountered in daily life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Generally, a [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negative number]] is defined as any number less than zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Their implications become clear when viewed through practical examples like temperature and banking.

## Temperature Readings

Temperature scales, such as Celsius, frequently use [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negative numbers]] to represent cold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
For instance:
*   If the temperature is 3 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   And it is predicted to get 4 degrees colder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   The resulting temperature would be negative 1 degree Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

This can be visualized on a [[visualizing_negative_numbers_on_a_number_line | number line]]: moving to the right of zero increases in positive values, while moving to the left results in negative values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

It's important to understand that a [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negative number]] with a larger absolute value signifies a smaller quantity; for example, negative 3 degrees is less than negative 1 degree, meaning it is colder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Similarly, negative 100 is much smaller than negative 1, indicating a greater "lack of heat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Banking and Debt

In financial contexts, [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negative numbers]] represent debt or a deficit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
Consider this scenario:
*   Starting with $10 in a bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   Spending $30, assuming a flexible bank that allows spending beyond the current balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   The bank account balance would become negative $20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

This implies that instead of having money, one now owes the bank $20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. [[visualizing_negative_numbers_on_a_number_line | Visualizing this on a number line]], starting at $10 and spending $30 means moving 30 spaces to the left. Spending the first $10 brings the balance to $0, and spending the remaining $20 results in a balance of negative $20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

### General Movement on the Number Line
*   When spending, subtracting, or getting colder, you move to the left of the [[visualizing_negative_numbers_on_a_number_line | number line]], and numbers get smaller, potentially going below zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   When adding, such as receiving a paycheck, you move to the right of the [[visualizing_negative_numbers_on_a_number_line | number line]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

## [[adding_negative_numbers | Adding and Subtracting Negative Numbers]]

Understanding these real-world examples helps in performing mathematical operations with [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negative numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   **3 minus 4**: Starting at 3 and [[subtracting negative numbers | subtracting]] 4 means moving 4 units to the left on the [[visualizing_negative_numbers_on_a_number_line | number line]], resulting in -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.
*   **2 minus 8**: Starting at 2 and [[subtracting negative numbers | subtracting]] 8 moves 8 units to the left. This means moving 2 units to reach 0, and then another 6 units beyond 0, resulting in -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
*   **Negative 4 minus 2**: Starting at -4 and [[subtracting negative numbers | subtracting]] 2 means moving 2 units further to the left from -4, resulting in -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   **Negative 3 plus 2**: Starting at -3 and [[adding negative numbers | adding]] 2 means moving 2 units to the right, resulting in -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

Visualizing these operations on a [[visualizing_negative_numbers_on_a_number_line | number line]] is highly encouraged to grasp the meaning of [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negative numbers]] and their behavior in [[how_to_add_and_subtract_negative_numbers | addition and subtraction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

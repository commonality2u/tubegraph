From: [[khanacademy]] <br/> 

Sal Khan, founder of Khan Academy, has publicly extended a "huge shout out and thank you" to Elon Musk and The Musk Foundation for their "incredibly generous support" of Khan Academy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This appreciation comes after a recent $5 million donation to the educational non-profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Impact of the Donation

The $5 million donation is expected to significantly [[impact_of_the_donation_on_educational_content | accelerate Khan Academy's educational efforts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Specifically, it will allow for:
*   Acceleration of content across all subjects from kindergarten through the early stages of college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   Increased science content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   More focus on early learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   Development of more engaging software and practice exercises for millions of students and teachers worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Khan Academy's Global Reach and Return on Investment

Khan Academy has seen significant [[khan_academy_origins_and_growth | growth and impact]] since its inception. The platform boasts 120 million registered users and serves 20 to 30 million students every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, accumulating approximately 200 million hours of learning annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

Efficacy studies demonstrate a remarkable [[philanthropic_return_on_investment_in_education | social return on investment]] (SROI) for Khan Academy, estimated at 400 to 500 to 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This far surpasses what is typically considered a good return in the philanthropic sector, which is around a five to one or ten to one ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Future Aspirations and Call for Continued Support

Despite its current reach, Khan Academy has immense [[khan_academys_global_educational_aspirations | global aspirations]] to serve the billions of people who need a way to tap into their full potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This type of investment is viewed as foundational to building a multi-generational institution that can help future innovators, akin to Elon Musk, realize their capabilities and contribute to the advancement of civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

While Musk's donation is "incredible," Sal Khan emphasized the ongoing need for [[call_for_additional_support_and_donations | additional support]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Khan Academy continues to run at a deficit for 2021, and every donation, regardless of size, helps accelerate learning across various dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Globally, five trillion dollars are spent on education annually, yet Khan Academy's budget is only one one-hundred-thousandth of that, comparable to a large high school's budget, despite its goal to serve the entire planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Inspiration from Elon Musk

Sal Khan expressed profound admiration for Elon Musk, recalling an interview with him in 2013 at the Khan Academy office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Khan stated that he "looks up" to Musk and finds immense inspiration in his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. When questioning if Khan Academy's mission to "educate all of humanity" is too ambitious, Khan reflects on Musk's past predictions from their interview, noting that "pretty much everything" Musk said he was going to do in 2013, including "pretty large statements," he has either accomplished or is very close to accomplishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

This serves as a powerful reminder that the mission of universal education is not too big to achieve, much like solving climate change, improving transportation, or pursuing [[space_exploration_and_spacexs_mission | colonizing other planets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Khan concludes by stating that humanity "can't shy away from educating the planet and other planets going forward" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

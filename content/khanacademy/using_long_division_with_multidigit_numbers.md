To successfully divide [[long_division_with_larger_numbers | into larger numbers]], a fundamental requirement is a solid knowledge of [[importance_of_multiplication_tables_for_division | multiplication tables]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It's recommended to know them from 1x1 up to at least 10x10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, or ideally up to 12x12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Basic Division Using Multiplication Tables

For simple division problems, you can directly use your knowledge of multiplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

*   **Example: 25 ÷ 5**
    Instead of [[using_multiplication_to_simplify_counting | drawing 25 objects]] and dividing them into groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, think: "5 times what equals 25?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Since 5 x 5 = 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, 5 goes into 25 five times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. The answer, 5, is written in the ones place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Example: 49 ÷ 7**
    Think: "7 times what equals 49?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Since 7 x 7 = 49 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, the answer is 7.
*   **Example: 54 ÷ 9**
    Think: "9 times what equals 54?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. If you know 9 x 5 = 45, then 9 x 6 is 9 more, which is 54 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Thus, 9 goes into 54 six times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## Division with Remainders

Not all division problems result in a whole number without anything left over. Sometimes there's a remainder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

*   **Example: 23 ÷ 3**
    List multiples of 3: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Notice there is no 23 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
    Find the largest multiple of 3 that is less than or equal to 23. That's 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
    3 goes into 21 seven times (3 x 7 = 21) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
    Subtract 21 from 23: 23 - 21 = 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
    So, 23 divided by 3 is 7 with a remainder of 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
    This can be written as 7 R 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

> [!NOTE] In the future, remainders can be expressed as [[decimals_to_fractions_conversion | decimals or fractions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

## [[stepbystep_process_of_long_division | Step-by-Step Long Division]] for Multidigit Numbers

When dealing with larger numbers, you use a systematic approach, often called long division. This method breaks down the problem into smaller, manageable steps using your basic multiplication facts.

### Example 1: 344 ÷ 4

1.  **Set up the problem**: Write the dividend (344) inside the division symbol and the divisor (4) outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
    ```
        ____
    4 | 344
    ```
2.  **Divide the first digit (or first two digits)**: How many times does 4 go into 3? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a> It goes in 0 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. So, consider the first two digits: 34 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
    *   How many times does 4 go into 34? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>
    *   Recall your 4-multiplication tables: 4 x 8 = 32, and 4 x 9 = 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
    *   Since 36 is larger than 34, 4 goes into 34 eight times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. Write "8" above the "4" in 344 (in the tens place) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
    ```
        8__
    4 | 344
    ```
3.  **Multiply and Subtract**: Multiply the quotient digit (8) by the divisor (4): 8 x 4 = 32 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Write "32" below "34" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
    Subtract 32 from 34: 34 - 32 = 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
    ```
        8__
    4 | 344
        32
        ---
         2
    ```
4.  **Bring down the next digit**: Bring down the "4" from 344 next to the remainder 2, forming 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
    ```
        8__
    4 | 344
        32
        ---
         24
    ```
5.  **Repeat the process**: Now, how many times does 4 go into 24? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>
    *   From multiplication tables, 4 x 6 = 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
    *   Write "6" above the "4" in 344 (in the ones place) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
    ```
        86
    4 | 344
        32
        ---
         24
    ```
6.  **Multiply and Subtract again**: Multiply the new quotient digit (6) by the divisor (4): 6 x 4 = 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Write "24" below the current 24.
    Subtract 24 from 24: 24 - 24 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
    ```
        86
    4 | 344
        32
        ---
         24
         24
         ---
          0
    ```
    Since the remainder is 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>, the division is complete.
    Therefore, 344 ÷ 4 = 86 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

### Example 2: 91 ÷ 7

1.  **Divide 7 into 9**: 7 goes into 9 one time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. Write "1" above the 9.
2.  **Multiply and Subtract**: 1 x 7 = 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. 9 - 7 = 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
3.  **Bring down the next digit**: Bring down the "1" to make 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
4.  **Repeat**: How many times does 7 go into 21? 7 x 3 = 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. Write "3" above the 1.
5.  **Multiply and Subtract**: 3 x 7 = 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. 21 - 21 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
    Therefore, 91 ÷ 7 = 13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

### Example 3: 608 ÷ 8

1.  **Divide 8 into 6**: It goes in 0 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
2.  **Divide 8 into 60**: How many times does 8 go into 60? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>
    *   8 x 7 = 56 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
    *   8 x 8 = 64 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
    *   Since 64 is too large, 8 goes into 60 seven times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. Write "7" above the 0 in 608 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
3.  **Multiply and Subtract**: 7 x 8 = 56 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. 60 - 56 = 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
4.  **Bring down the next digit**: Bring down the "8" to make 48 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
5.  **Repeat**: How many times does 8 go into 48? 8 x 6 = 48 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. Write "6" above the 8.
6.  **Multiply and Subtract**: 6 x 8 = 48 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. 48 - 48 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
    Therefore, 608 ÷ 8 = 76 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

By practicing these steps, you can tackle larger division problems efficiently, relying on your knowledge of [[multiplication as repeated addition | multiplication]] tables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

The concepts of vectors and scalars might seem complex, but they are quite simple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. This article will define both and provide examples to clarify their [[differences_between_vectors_and_scalars | differences]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

## Definitions

*   **Vector**: A quantity that has both a magnitude (size) and a direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.
*   **Scalar**: A quantity that only has a magnitude (size) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.

## Distance vs. Displacement

Consider moving a brick across the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. If you measure that it has moved 5 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>:

*   **[[concept_of_distance_and_displacement | Distance]]**: If you only state "5 meters," you are describing the [[concept_of_distance_and_displacement | distance]] the brick traveled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. This is a **scalar quantity** because it only specifies the magnitude (5 meters) without any direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. Without a specified direction, you don't know if it moved left, right, up, or down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.
*   **[[concept_of_distance_and_displacement | Displacement]]**: If you specify "5 meters to the right," you are describing the brick's [[concept_of_distance_and_displacement | displacement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. This is a **vector quantity** because it includes both the magnitude (5 meters) and the direction (to the right) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.

> [[concept_of_distance_and_displacement | Distance]] is a scalar quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>. [[concept_of_distance_and_displacement | Displacement]] is a vector quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.

## Speed vs. Velocity

Now, let's consider how fast the brick moved. Suppose the brick moved 5 meters in 2 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. The time taken (2 seconds) is generally considered a scalar quantity, as time typically moves in one direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>.

To find how fast it moved, we calculate:
5 meters / 2 seconds = 2.5 meters per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>.

*   **[[understanding_speed_and_velocity | Speed]]**: If you only state "2.5 meters per second," you are describing the brick's [[understanding_speed_and_velocity | speed]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>. This is a **scalar quantity** because it tells you the magnitude of how fast it went without specifying direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>.
*   **[[understanding_speed_and_velocity | Velocity]]**: If you state "2.5 meters per second to the right," you are describing the brick's [[understanding_speed_and_velocity | velocity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>. This is a **vector quantity** because it includes both the magnitude (2.5 meters per second) and the direction (to the right) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> [[understanding_speed_and_velocity | Speed]] is a scalar quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>. [[understanding_speed_and_velocity | Velocity]] is a vector quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>.

In summary, when talking about a change in position, if you specify the direction, you're discussing [[concept_of_distance_and_displacement | displacement]] (vector); if not, it's [[concept_of_distance_and_displacement | distance]] (scalar) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>. Similarly, when describing how fast something is going, if you include the direction, it's [[understanding_speed_and_velocity | velocity]] (vector); otherwise, it's [[understanding_speed_and_velocity | speed]] (scalar) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>.

Whole numbers, while not appearing as fractions initially, can be rewritten in fractional form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. This conversion is particularly useful when performing operations like addition or subtraction with other fractions, as it allows for the establishment of a [[finding_a_common_denominator|common denominator]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

## Process

To convert a whole number into a fraction with a desired common denominator:
1.  Identify the denominator of the other fraction involved in the calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
2.  Rewrite the whole number as a fraction where both the numerator and the denominator are that identified number. This works because any number divided by itself equals 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

### Example: Subtracting a Whole Number

Consider the problem: `1/10 - 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

To solve this, the whole number `1` needs to be expressed as a fraction with a denominator of `10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
*   The whole number `1` can be written as `10/10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   Thus, the problem becomes `1/10 - 10/10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   With [[subtracting_fractions_with_the_same_denominator|the same denominator]], you subtract only the numerators while keeping the denominator the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   `1 - 10` equals `-9`, so the result is `-9/10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

The **mean** is a measure of [[central_tendency_and_averages | central tendency]] that is commonly referred to as the "average" in everyday language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. It is sometimes specifically called the *arithmetic mean* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## How to Calculate the Mean

To [[understanding_mean | calculate the mean]], you sum up all the numbers in a set and then divide by the total count of numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

### Example Calculation

Given the numbers: 23, 29, 20, 32, 23, 21, 33, 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

1.  **Sum the numbers**:
    23 + 29 + 20 + 32 + 23 + 21 + 33 + 25 = 206 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.
2.  **Count the numbers**: There are 8 numbers in the set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
3.  **Divide the sum by the count**:
    206 รท 8 = 25.75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.

Therefore, the mean for this set of numbers is 25.75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Other Measures of Central Tendency
> While the mean is a common measure, other ways to think about the "middle" or [[central_tendency_and_averages | central tendency]] of a data set include the median and the mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

## Understanding Median

The [[understanding_median | median]] is the middle number in a data set when the numbers are ordered from least to greatest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.

### How to Calculate the Median

1.  **Order the numbers** from least to greatest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.
    Original set: 23, 29, 20, 32, 23, 21, 33, 25
    Ordered set: 20, 21, 23, 23, 25, 29, 32, 33 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.
2.  **Identify the middle number(s)**:
    *   If there is an odd number of data points, the median is the single middle number.
    *   If there is an even number of data points (as in this example with 8 numbers), there will be two middle numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. In this case, the two middle numbers are 23 and 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.
3.  **Average the middle numbers (if even count)**:
    To find the median when there are two middle numbers, calculate their mean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.
    (23 + 25) รท 2 = 48 รท 2 = 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

Even if 24 is not in the original data set, it is the median <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.

## Understanding Mode

The **mode** is the number that appears most frequently in a data set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.

### How to Calculate the Mode

Examine the frequency of each number in the data set: 23, 29, 20, 32, 23, 21, 33, 25.

*   20: appears once
*   21: appears once
*   23: appears twice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>
*   25: appears once
*   29: appears once
*   32: appears once
*   33: appears once

Since 23 shows up more often than any other number (twice), 23 is the mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.

The movement of particles or molecules, especially from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration, is a fundamental concept in chemistry and biology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. This process is driven by the random kinetic energy of molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

## Fundamental Definitions

When discussing solutions, several key terms are used:
*   **Solvent** The substance present in the larger amount, which dissolves other substances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. In many biological and chemical systems, water is the most common solvent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
*   **Solute** The substance present in the lesser amount that is dissolved in the solvent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. For example, sugar molecules dissolved in water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Solution** The combination of the solvent and the solute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   **Concentration** A measure of how much of a particular particle exists per unit of space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## [[diffusion_process_and_examples | Diffusion]]

[[diffusion_process_and_examples | Diffusion]] is the process where particles or molecules spread out from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. This occurs due to the random movement and collisions of molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Over time, a system undergoing [[diffusion_process_and_examples | diffusion]] will tend towards an equilibrium where particles are relatively spread out and concentrations are roughly equal throughout the available space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. This is based on [[basic_probability_concepts | probabilities]] of molecules moving in random directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

### Examples of [[diffusion_process_and_examples | Diffusion]]
*   **Gas Diffusion** If a container has gaseous oxygen particles concentrated in one area and a vacuum in another, the oxygen particles will randomly move and eventually spread out to fill the entire container <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   **Solute Diffusion** In a solution, if solute molecules are concentrated on one side of a connected container, they will randomly move through the connection until they are more evenly distributed across both sides, making the concentrations roughly equal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

### Concentration Terminology
*   **Hypertonic Solution** A solution with a high concentration of solute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. The prefix "hyper-" implies having a lot or too much of something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
*   **Hypotonic Solution** A solution with a low concentration of solute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. The prefix "hypo-" implies not enough of something (e.g., hypoglycemic means low blood sugar) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

In general [[diffusion_process_and_examples | diffusion]], solute moves from a hypertonic solution to a hypotonic solution, provided there are no barriers to its movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

## [[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | Osmosis]]

[[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | Osmosis]] is a specific type of [[diffusion_process_and_examples | diffusion]] that involves the movement of a **solvent** (typically water) across a **semi-permeable membrane** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. A semi-permeable membrane allows certain molecules (like water) to pass through, but blocks others (like larger solute molecules) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

When a semi-permeable membrane separates a hypertonic solution (high solute concentration) from a hypotonic solution (low solute concentration), the solvent (water) will move from the hypotonic side to the hypertonic side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. This happens because the solute molecules on the hypertonic side can block the passage of solvent molecules out of that side, while solvent molecules from the hypotonic side have less obstruction to enter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. This net flow of water aims to equalize the concentrations on both sides of the membrane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.

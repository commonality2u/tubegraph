Photosynthesis is one of the most vital biological processes on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Without it, life as we know it would likely not exist, as it provides the fundamental source of food and oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

This process is primarily associated with plants, but it also occurs in various bacteria and algae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. In simple terms, plants take carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight, and convert them into sugars (carbohydrates) and oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Importance for Life

The products of photosynthesis are crucial for virtually all oxygen-breathing life forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>:
*   **Carbohydrates/Sugars**: These are essential to fuel bodies. In humans, for instance, glucose (a simple carbohydrate) is broken down through [[introduction_to_cellular_respiration | cellular respiration]] to generate ATP, which is the cell's energy currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Oxygen**: Oxygen is needed for [[introduction_to_cellular_respiration | cellular respiration]] to break down glucose and extract energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

Organisms like plants, bacteria, and algae are capable of harnessing photons from sunlight to create these essential sugars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. These carbohydrates serve as the primary fuel source for animals, either directly (e.g., eating a potato) or indirectly (e.g., eating an animal that consumed plants) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

## General Chemical Equation

The general equation for [[photosynthesis_chemical_equation | photosynthesis]] can be written more scientifically:

<div class="callout">
CO₂ (Carbon Dioxide) + H₂O (Water) + Photons (Sunlight) → (CH₂O)n (Carbohydrate) + O₂ (Oxygen) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>
</div>

In this equation, (CH₂O)n represents a general carbohydrate, where 'n' denotes multiples of the CH₂O unit. For example, in glucose, 'n' is 6, resulting in C₆H₁₂O₆ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. This process involves multiple complex steps rather than a direct conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## Stages of Photosynthesis

[[overview_of_photosynthesis | Photosynthesis]] is broadly divided into two main stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>:

### 1. Light-Dependent Reactions
These reactions require sunlight (photons) to occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   **Inputs**: Photons and water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   **Outputs**: Molecular oxygen (O₂) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>, and crucial energy-carrying molecules: [[role_of_atp_and_nadph_in_photosynthesis | ATP]] (adenosine triphosphate) and [[role_of_atp_and_nadph_in_photosynthesis | NADPH]] (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
    *   ATP is the cell's energy currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
    *   NADPH is a reducing agent, meaning it can donate a hydrogen atom and its associated electron to other molecules, thereby reducing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. This transfer of electrons from a higher to a lower energy state provides energy for the subsequent reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

### 2. Light-Independent Reactions (Calvin Cycle)
Often incorrectly called "dark reactions," these reactions do not directly require photons to occur, but they do happen when the sun is out because they depend on the products of the light reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
*   **Inputs**: [[role_of_atp_and_nadph_in_photosynthesis | ATP]], [[role_of_atp_and_nadph_in_photosynthesis | NADPH]] (from the light reactions), and carbon dioxide (CO₂) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.
*   **Outputs**: This cycle, known as the Calvin Cycle in most plants, produces phosphoglyceraldehyde (PGAL) or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
    *   PGAL/G3P is a three-carbon molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
    *   These molecules serve as building blocks for other carbohydrates, including glucose. For instance, two PGAL/G3P molecules can be combined to produce one glucose molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

## Connection to Cellular Respiration

The PGAL/G3P molecules produced in photosynthesis are the same type of molecules that result from the splitting of glucose during the [[glycolysis_process | glycolysis process]], which is the initial step of [[energy_production_through_cellular_respiration | energy production through cellular respiration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. While photosynthesis builds glucose, [[overview_of_glycolysis | glycolysis]] breaks it down for energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

In summary, photosynthesis is a two-stage process that takes in sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to produce oxygen and carbohydrates, fueling life on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

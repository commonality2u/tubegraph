When simplifying fractions, it's often necessary to identify [[factoring_in_algebra | common factors]] shared between the numerator and the denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. By dividing both the numerator and the denominator by these common factors, the fraction can be reduced to its lowest terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Example: Simplifying 10/18

To simplify the fraction 10/18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>:
*   Observe that both 10 and 18 are divisible by 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   Divide the numerator (10) by 2, which results in 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   Divide the denominator (18) by 2, which results in 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   The simplified fraction is 5/9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Simplification Timing

Simplification can occur at different stages of a calculation involving fractions:

### After Multiplication
One approach is to perform the multiplication first and then simplify the resulting fraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. For example, when [[multiplying_fractions | multiplying fractions]] like 5/6 times 2/3:
*   Multiply the numerators: 5 x 2 = 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   Multiply the denominators: 6 x 3 = 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   This yields 10/18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   Then, simplify 10/18 by dividing both by their [[factoring_in_algebra | common factor]], 2, to get 5/9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### Before Multiplication (Pre-simplification)
Alternatively, common factors can be divided out *before* the multiplication is performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This can make the numbers smaller and easier to work with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

Using the same example, 5/6 times 2/3:
*   Identify a common factor between a numerator and a denominator (even if they are from different fractions). In this case, 2 from the numerator of 2/3 and 6 from the denominator of 5/6 share a common factor of 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   Divide the numerator (2) by 2, making it 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   Divide the denominator (6) by 2, making it 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   The expression becomes 5/3 times 1/3.
*   Now, [[multiplying_fractions | multiply]] the new numbers: 5 x 1 = 5, and 3 x 3 = 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   The result is 5/9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

Both methods yield the same correct answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

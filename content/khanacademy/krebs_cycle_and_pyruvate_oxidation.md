## Context: [[Glycolysis]] Review

The process begins with a glucose molecule, a 6-carbon molecule, which is split in half by [[Glycolysis]] to form two 3-carbon pyruvic acids or pyruvate molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. [[Glycolysis]] literally lyses (splits) the glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This process does not require oxygen; it can occur in the presence or absence of oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

From [[Glycolysis]], there is a net payoff of two [[ATP production and consumption in glycolysis | ATPs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. This is because it uses two [[ATP production and consumption in glycolysis | ATPs]] in an investment stage and then generates four, resulting in a net gain of two [[ATP production and consumption in glycolysis | ATPs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Additionally, [[Glycolysis]] produces two [[Reduction of NAD to NADH in glycolysis | NADHs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Cellular Location of Processes

*   **[[Glycolysis]]**: This process occurs in the cytoplasm, the fluidic space of the cell between organelles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   **[[Krebs Cycle]]**: This cycle takes place in the mitochondria, specifically within the inner space of the inner membrane, known as the matrix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Mitochondria are often called the "power centers of the cell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. The inner membrane of the mitochondria is convoluted, forming structures called cristae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Pyruvate Oxidation (The Preparatory Stage)

Before entering the [[Krebs Cycle]], pyruvic acid undergoes a preparation step called **pyruvate oxidation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. During this process, one carbon is cleaved off the 3-carbon pyruvate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. This cleaved carbon becomes carbon dioxide (CO2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. The remaining 2-carbon compound is called **acetyl-CoA** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. In addition, [[NAD reduction to NADH in glycolysis | NAD+]] is reduced to [[Reduction of NAD to NADH in glycolysis | NADH]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

Since two pyruvates are produced from one glucose molecule, this pyruvate oxidation step happens twice for every glucose molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. Therefore, for every glucose molecule, pyruvate oxidation produces two [[Reduction of NAD to NADH in glycolysis | NADHs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

## The [[Krebs Cycle]] (Citric Acid Cycle)

### Cycle Overview

The [[Krebs Cycle]], also known as the citric acid cycle, begins when the 2-carbon acetyl-CoA merges with a 4-carbon molecule called **oxaloacetic acid** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. These react together to form **citrate** or **citric acid**, which is a 6-carbon molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. All reactions within the [[Krebs Cycle]] are catalyzed by enzymes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

The citric acid is then oxidized over a series of steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. During these steps, two carbons are cleaved off, eventually regenerating the 4-carbon oxaloacetic acid, allowing the cycle to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. These cleaved carbons are released as carbon dioxide (CO2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

### Outputs of the [[Krebs Cycle]] (Per Turn/Per Pyruvate)

For each turn of the [[Krebs Cycle]] (i.e., for each pyruvate molecule):
*   Three [[Reduction of NAD to NADH in glycolysis | NAD+]] molecules are reduced to three [[Reduction of NAD to NADH in glycolysis | NADHs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   One [[ATP production and consumption in glycolysis | ATP]] molecule is produced (ADP turns into [[ATP production and consumption in glycolysis | ATP]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. (Note: Some diagrams might show GTP production, which can then be used to form [[ATP production and consumption in glycolysis | ATP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>.)
*   One FAD molecule is reduced to one FADH2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

## Overall Energy Yield Per Glucose Molecule

To calculate the total output for one glucose molecule, we must account for the products of [[Glycolysis]], pyruvate oxidation, and two turns of the [[Krebs Cycle]].

### [[Glycolysis]] Outputs (per glucose)
*   2 net [[ATP production and consumption in glycolysis | ATPs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>
*   2 [[Reduction of NAD to NADH in glycolysis | NADHs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>

### Pyruvate Oxidation Outputs (per glucose, happens twice)
*   2 [[Reduction of NAD to NADH in glycolysis | NADHs]] (1 per pyruvate x 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>
*   2 CO2 molecules (1 per pyruvate x 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>

### [[Krebs Cycle]] Outputs (per glucose, two turns)
*   6 [[Reduction of NAD to NADH in glycolysis | NADHs]] (3 per turn x 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>
*   2 [[ATP production and consumption in glycolysis | ATPs]] (1 per turn x 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>
*   2 FADH2s (1 per turn x 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>
*   4 CO2 molecules (2 per turn x 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>

### Total Carbon Dioxide Production
All six carbons from the initial glucose molecule are eventually released as CO2: two from pyruvate oxidation and four from the [[Krebs Cycle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

### Total ATP Yield
*   **Direct [[ATP production and consumption in glycolysis | ATPs]]**: 4 [[ATP production and consumption in glycolysis | ATPs]] (2 from [[Glycolysis]] + 2 from [[Krebs Cycle]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.
*   **Total [[Reduction of NAD to NADH in glycolysis | NADHs]]**: 10 [[Reduction of NAD to NADH in glycolysis | NADHs]] (2 from [[Glycolysis]] + 2 from pyruvate oxidation + 6 from [[Krebs Cycle]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.
*   **Total FADH2s**: 2 FADH2s (from [[Krebs Cycle]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.

These [[Reduction of NAD to NADH in glycolysis | NADHs]] and FADH2s are crucial because they serve as inputs for the [[oxidation_and_reduction_processes_in_the_electron_transport_chain | electron transport chain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   Each [[Reduction of NAD to NADH in glycolysis | NADH]] typically yields three [[ATP production and consumption in glycolysis | ATPs]] in the [[oxidation_and_reduction_processes_in_the_electron_transport_chain | electron transport chain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>, meaning 10 [[Reduction of NAD to NADH in glycolysis | NADHs]] produce 30 [[ATP production and consumption in glycolysis | ATPs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
*   Each FADH2 typically yields two [[ATP production and consumption in glycolysis | ATPs]] in the [[oxidation_and_reduction_processes_in the electron transport chain | electron transport chain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>, meaning 2 FADH2s produce 4 [[ATP production and consumption in glycolysis | ATPs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

Summing these up, the total theoretical maximum [[ATP production and consumption in glycolysis | ATP]] yield from one glucose molecule is 38 [[ATP production and consumption in glycolysis | ATPs]] (4 direct + 30 from [[Reduction of NAD to NADH in glycolysis | NADH]] + 4 from FADH2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. This is considered the theoretical maximum for super-efficient cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

## Alternative Metabolic Pathways

While glucose is a primary fuel, the [[Krebs Cycle]] serves as a central entry point for the catabolism of other macromolecules, such as proteins and fats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.
*   Proteins can be broken down into amino acids, which can then be converted into acetyl-CoA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.
*   Fats can be turned into glucose in the liver, which can then go through the entire cellular respiration process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

Acetyl-CoA is a general catabolic intermediary that can enter the [[Krebs Cycle]] to generate [[ATP production and consumption in glycolysis | ATP]], regardless of whether the initial fuel source was carbohydrates, proteins, or fats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

## Visualizing the Cycle

Detailed diagrams of the [[Krebs Cycle]], like those found in textbooks or Wikipedia, show the molecular structures and intermediate compounds involved in each step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. These diagrams illustrate the preparatory pyruvate oxidation step, the formation of acetyl-CoA, its merging with oxaloacetate to form citrate, and the subsequent oxidation steps where [[Reduction of NAD to NADH in glycolysis | NADHs]], FADH2s, and [[ATP production and consumption in glycolysis | ATP]] (or GTP) are produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>. Each of these steps is facilitated by enzymes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

This article explores the fundamental differences between [[examples_of_vector_and_scalar_quantities | vectors]] and [[examples_of_vector_and_scalar_quantities | scalars]], applying these concepts to define distance and displacement, as well as speed and velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. While these ideas may initially sound complex, they are quite simple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Vectors and Scalars Defined

*   A **[[examples_of_vector_and_scalar_quantities | vector]]** is a quantity that possesses both a magnitude (or size) and a specific direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   A **[[examples_of_vector_and_scalar_quantities | scalar]]** is a quantity that has only a magnitude (or size) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

Examples help clarify these definitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Distance (A Scalar Quantity)

Consider a brick moved from one position on the ground to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. If a ruler measures the movement as 5 meters, this value alone represents the size or magnitude of the movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

If only "5 meters" is stated, it does not specify the direction of movement (e.g., right, left, up, down, in, or out) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Therefore, 5 meters is a [[examples_of_vector_and_scalar_quantities | scalar]] quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

The concept of how much something has changed its position without specifying direction is called **distance** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. For example, a brick moving a distance of 5 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. **Distance is a [[examples_of_vector_and_scalar_quantities | scalar]] quantity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

## Displacement (A Vector Quantity)

If the movement of the brick is specified as "5 meters to the right," both a magnitude (5 meters) and a direction (to the right) are provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. This complete description makes it a [[examples_of_vector_and_scalar_quantities | vector]] quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

When the change in position is described with its direction, the [[examples_of_vector_and_scalar_quantities | vector]] version of distance is called **displacement** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. So, the brick was displaced 5 meters to the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. **Displacement is a [[examples_of_vector_and_scalar_quantities | vector]] quantity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

## Speed (A Scalar Quantity)

Using the example of the brick moving 5 meters to the right, suppose this movement occurred over a time period of 2 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Time, for typical physics problems, is considered to go only in the positive direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

To measure how fast the brick moved, we can calculate 5 meters per 2 seconds, which simplifies to 2.5 meters per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. This value, 2.5 meters per second, tells how far it traveled in a certain amount of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. However, it does not include direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Therefore, this measurement is a [[examples_of_vector_and_scalar_quantities | scalar]] quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

The [[examples_of_vector_and_scalar_quantities | scalar]] quantity for how fast something is going is called **[[understanding_speed_and_velocity | speed]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. So, the [[understanding_speed_and_velocity | speed]] of the brick is 2.5 meters per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

## Velocity (A Vector Quantity)

If the calculation includes the direction, such as "5 meters to the right in 2 seconds," the result is 2.5 meters per second to the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. This statement includes both the magnitude of the [[understanding_speed_and_velocity | speed]] (2.5 meters per second) and the direction (to the right) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. This makes it a [[examples_of_vector_and_scalar_quantities | vector]] quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

When both [[understanding_speed_and_velocity | speed]] and direction are specified, you are talking about **[[understanding_speed_and_velocity | velocity]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

## Summary

*   If you specify the direction of a change in position, you are talking about **displacement** (a [[examples_of_vector_and_scalar_quantities | vector]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   If you do not specify the direction of a change in position, you are talking about **distance** (a [[examples_of_vector_and_scalar_quantities | scalar]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
*   If you describe how fast something is going and include its direction, you are talking about **[[understanding_speed_and_velocity | velocity]]** (a [[examples_of_vector_and_scalar_quantities | vector]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   If you describe how fast something is going without giving direction, you are talking about **[[understanding_speed_and_velocity | speed]]** (a [[examples_of_vector_and_scalar_quantities | scalar]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

These concepts are foundational for [[calculating_speed_and_velocity | calculating speed and velocity]] and understanding motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

When first encountering [[random_variables | random variables]], it can be easy to confuse them with the traditional variables typically seen in algebra classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. However, there are fundamental distinctions between the two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Traditional Variables

Traditional variables, like those in algebraic expressions such as "x + 5 = 6" or "y = x + 7", are usually denoted by lowercase letters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. With these variables, you can either:
*   **Solve for them:** As in "x + 5 = 6," where you can determine that x equals 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   **Assign values:** You can assign a value to 'x' to see how 'y' varies as a function of 'x' in an equation like "y = x + 7" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

The key characteristic is that you can assign specific values to traditional variables or solve for their singular unknown value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

## [[random_variables | Random Variables]]

In contrast, [[random_variables | random variables]] are fundamentally different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. A [[random_variable | random variable]] is a way to map outcomes of random processes to numbers, effectively quantifying those outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. They are typically denoted by capital letters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

### [[examples_of_random_variables | Examples of Random Variables]]
*   **Coin Flip:** A [[random_variable | random variable]] 'X' could be [[definition_of_a_random_variable | defined]] as 1 if a fair coin lands heads and 0 if it lands tails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Even if defined as 100 for heads and 703 for tails, it would still be a legitimate [[random_variable | random variable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Dice Rolls:** A [[random_variable | random variable]] 'Y' could represent the sum of the upward faces after rolling seven dice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

The purpose of [[random_variables | random variables]] is to quantify outcomes, which allows for more mathematical analysis and cleaner notation in probability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. For instance, instead of writing "the probability that the sum of the upward faces after rolling seven dice is less than or equal to 30," one can simply write "P(Y â‰¤ 30)" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

## Key Distinction: Probabilities vs. Assigned Values

The core difference lies in how values are associated:

*   **Traditional Variables:** You *assign* values to them or *solve* for their single determined value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   **[[random_variables | Random Variables]]:** A [[random_variable | random variable]] can take on many different values, each with its own associated probability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Therefore, it makes sense to discuss the *probability* of a [[random_variable | random variable]] equaling, being less than, greater than, or having a certain property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

In essence, traditional variables represent fixed or assignable unknowns, while [[random_variables | random variables]] represent numerical outcomes of uncertain events, characterized by their probabilities.

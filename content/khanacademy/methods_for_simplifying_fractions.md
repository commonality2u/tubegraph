[[simplifying_fractions | Simplifying fractions]] involves reducing them to their lowest terms, also referred to as [[reducing_ratios_to_simplest_form | reducing to simplest form]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This process is essential when dealing with products of fractions, such as when [[multiplying_fractions | multiplying fractions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Why Simplify?

Although an unsimplified fraction, like 10/18, may technically be a "right answer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, it is common practice to simplify it to its lowest terms. This is done when the numerator and denominator share [[finding_common_factors_in_fractions | common factors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. For instance, both 10 and 18 are divisible by 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Methods for Simplifying

There are two primary approaches to [[simplifying_fractions | simplifying fractions]] discussed:

### 1. Simplifying After Multiplication

This method involves performing the [[multiplying_fractions | multiplication]] first and then [[simplifying_fractions_after_conversion | simplifying the resulting fraction]].

**Example:**
To multiply 5/6 by 2/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>:
1.  Multiply the numerators: 5 times 2 equals 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
2.  Multiply the denominators: 6 times 3 equals 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
3.  The product is 10/18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
4.  To simplify 10/18, find a common factor. Both 10 and 18 are divisible by 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
5.  Divide the numerator by 2: 10 รท 2 = 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
6.  Divide the denominator by 2: 18 รท 2 = 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
7.  The simplified answer is 5/9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### 2. Simplifying Before Multiplication

This approach involves simplifying common factors between numerators and denominators *before* performing the [[multiplying_fractions | multiplication]]. This can make the numbers smaller and easier to work with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

**Example:**
To multiply 5/6 by 2/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>:
1.  Look for common factors between any numerator and any denominator. In this case, 2 (from 2/3) and 6 (from 5/6) are both divisible by 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
2.  Divide the numerator 2 by 2, which results in 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
3.  Divide the denominator 6 by 2, which results in 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
4.  Now, the expression becomes 5/3 times 1/3.
5.  Multiply the new numerators: 5 times 1 equals 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
6.  Multiply the new denominators: 3 times 3 equals 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
7.  The simplified answer is 5/9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> Both methods yield the same result, 5/9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Simplifying before [[multiplying_fractions | multiplication]] can sometimes make it easier to identify factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

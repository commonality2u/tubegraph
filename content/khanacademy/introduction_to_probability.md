[[definition_of_probability | Probability]] provides a framework for understanding and describing the chances of a fundamentally random event occurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. It helps quantify the likelihood of various [[events_and_outcomes_in_probability | outcomes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Calculating Probability

One common way to conceptualize [[definition_of_probability | probability]], especially in textbooks, is by using the ratio of favorable outcomes to the total number of equally likely possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>:

> [!NOTE] Probability Formula
> Probability (Event) = (Number of possibilities that meet conditions) / (Total number of equally likely possibilities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>

### Example: Flipping a Fair Coin

Consider a [[understanding_fair_coins_and_probability | fair coin]], which has an equal chance of landing on either side (heads or tails) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

*   **Heads:** One side of the coin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Tails:** The other side of the coin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

To find the [[definition_of_probability | probability]] of getting heads:
1.  **Total equally likely possibilities:** There are two possibilities: heads or tails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
2.  **Possibilities meeting the condition (heads):** Only one possibility is heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

Therefore, the [[definition_of_probability | probability]] of getting heads is 1/2, or 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

### Conceptualizing Probability Through Repeated Experiments

Another way to understand [[definition_of_probability | probability]] is by thinking about what happens if an [[experimentation_in_probability | experiment]] is conducted many, many times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. A single coin flip is considered an [[experimentation_in_probability | experiment]] in [[definition_of_probability | probability]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

If you were to flip a coin a million or a billion times, the percentage of those flips that result in heads would trend very closely to 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. The more times the [[experimentation_in_probability | experiment]] is run, the closer the observed outcomes will get to the theoretical [[definition_of_probability | probability]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. While there's always a tiny chance of extreme [[events_and_outcomes_in_probability | outcomes]] (like all tails in a million flips), it becomes less likely with more trials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

## Examples with a Fair Die

Let's apply these ideas to rolling a fair die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. A fair die has six equally likely possibilities for its outcome: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

*   **Probability of rolling a 1:**
    *   Total equally likely possibilities: 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>
    *   Possibilities meeting the condition (rolling a 1): 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>
    *   Probability: 1/6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>

*   **Probability of rolling a 1 or a 6:**
    *   Total equally likely possibilities: 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>
    *   Possibilities meeting the condition (rolling a 1 or a 6): 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>
    *   Probability: 2/6 = 1/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>

*   **Probability of rolling a 2 AND a 3 (on a single roll):**
    *   Total equally likely possibilities: 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>
    *   Possibilities meeting the condition (rolling both a 2 and a 3 on one roll): 0. This is because getting a 2 and getting a 3 are mutually exclusive events; they cannot happen at the same time on a single roll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
    *   Probability: 0/6 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>

*   **Probability of rolling an even number:**
    *   Total equally likely possibilities: 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>
    *   Possibilities meeting the condition (rolling an even number): 2, 4, 6 (3 possibilities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>
    *   Probability: 3/6 = 1/2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>

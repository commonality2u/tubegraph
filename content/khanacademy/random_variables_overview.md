[[random_variables | Random variables]] are broadly categorized into two main types: [[discrete_random_variables | discrete random variables]] and [[continuous_random_variables | continuous random variables]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## [[discrete_random_variables | Discrete Random Variables]]
[[discrete_random_variables | Discrete random variables]] are those that can take on distinct or separate values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This means the values can be counted or listed, even if the list is infinitely long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. The term "discrete" in this context refers to "distinct or separate values," not to meanings like "polite" or "subtle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### [[examples_of_discrete_and_continuous_random_variables | Examples of Discrete Random Variables]]

*   **Coin Flip Outcome:** A [[random_variables | random variable]] *X* defined as 1 if a fair coin is heads and 0 if it's tails is a [[discrete_random_variables | discrete random variable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. It can only take on two distinct values (0 or 1), which are countable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   **Year of Birth:** The year a [[random_variables | random]] student in a class was born is a [[discrete_random_variables | discrete random variable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. It can be specific years like 1992, 1985, or 2001, but not values in between <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. These are countable values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Number of Ants Born:** The number of ants born tomorrow in the universe is a [[discrete_random_variables | discrete random variable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. While potentially very large, it represents whole, countable values (e.g., 1, 2, 3, or 5 quadrillion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
*   **Rounded Olympic Sprint Time:** The winning time for the men's 100-meter dash at the Olympics, *rounded to the nearest hundredth* of a second, is a [[discrete_random_variables | discrete random variable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. Although the *exact* time is [[continuous_random_variables | continuous]], rounding makes the possible values countable (e.g., 9.56, 9.57, 9.58 seconds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

## [[continuous_random_variables | Continuous Random Variables]]
[[continuous_random_variables | Continuous random variables]] are those that can take on any value within a given range or interval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This range could even be infinite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. For [[continuous_random_variables | continuous random variables]], it is impossible to list or count all possible values, as there are an infinite number of possibilities between any two given values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

### [[examples_of_discrete_and_continuous_random_variables | Examples of Continuous Random Variables]]

*   **Exact Mass of an Animal:** The exact mass of a [[random_variables | random]] animal selected at a zoo is a [[continuous_random_variables | continuous random variable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. An animal's mass can take on any value within a possible range (e.g., from near 0 kg for an ant to thousands of kilograms for an elephant), and can be measured with infinite precision, such as 123.75921 kilograms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   **Exact Olympic Sprint Time:** The exact winning time for the men's 100-meter dash at the 2016 Olympics is a [[continuous_random_variables | continuous random variable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. While clocks round to the nearest hundredth, the true exact time can be any value in an interval (e.g., 9.571 or 9.572359 seconds), meaning it cannot be fully listed or counted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

## [[differences_between_random_and_traditional_variables | Distinguishing Between Discrete and Continuous Random Variables]]
The core [[differences_between_random_and_traditional_variables | difference]] lies in whether the possible values of the [[random_variables | random variable]] can be counted or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>:
*   **[[discrete_random_variables | Discrete random variables]]**: Values are countable and can be listed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   **[[continuous_random_variables | Continuous random variables]]**: Values are uncountable; there are an infinite number of possible values within any interval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

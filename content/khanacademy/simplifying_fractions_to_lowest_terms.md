[[simplifying_fractions | Simplifying fractions]] and rational numbers to their [[simplifying_fractions | lowest terms]] is a fundamental concept in mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This idea extends to [[simplifying_algebraic_equations_involving_fractions | rational expressions]], which involve variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Understanding Lowest Terms for Rational Numbers

When first learning about fractions, the goal was to express them in [[simplifying_fractions | lowest terms]] by identifying and canceling out common factors between the numerator and the denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### Examples of Simplifying Fractions

*   **Example 1: 3/6**
    *   The numerator (3) and the denominator (6) share a common factor of 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.
    *   6 can be written as 2 times 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
    *   By dividing both the numerator and denominator by 3, or canceling out the common factor of 3, the fraction simplifies to 1/2 in [[simplifying_fractions | lowest terms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   **Example 2: 8/24**
    *   8 and 24 share a common factor of 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
    *   24 can be written as 3 times 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
    *   Canceling out the common factor of 8 results in 1/3 in [[simplifying_fractions | lowest terms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Simplifying Rational Expressions

The same principle of [[simplifying_expressions | simplifying expressions]] applies to [[simplifying_algebraic_equations_involving_fractions | rational expressions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Rational expressions are similar to rational numbers, but their numerators and denominators are expressions involving variables instead of just numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

To [[simplifying_expressions | simplify rational expressions]], factor both the numerator and the denominator to find common factors, and then cancel them out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### Examples of Simplifying Rational Expressions

*   **Example 1: (9x + 3) / (12x + 4)**
    *   **Factor the numerator:** 9x + 3 = 3(3x + 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
    *   **Factor the denominator:** 12x + 4 = 4(3x + 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
    *   **Common factor:** Both share (3x + 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
    *   **Simplified form:** Canceling out (3x + 1) leaves 3/4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
    *   **Condition:** The original expression was undefined if 3x + 1 = 0, meaning x = -1/3. Therefore, the simplified expression 3/4 is equivalent *only if* x ≠ -1/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

*   **Example 2: (x² - 9) / (5x + 15)**
    *   **Factor the numerator:** x² - 9 is a difference of squares: (x + 3)(x - 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
    *   **Factor the denominator:** 5x + 15 = 5(x + 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
    *   **Common factor:** Both share (x + 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
    *   **Simplified form:** Canceling out (x + 3) leaves (x - 3) / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
    *   **Condition:** The original expression was undefined if x + 3 = 0, meaning x = -3. So, the simplified expression (x - 3) / 5 is equivalent *only if* x ≠ -3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

*   **Example 3: (x² + 6x + 5) / (x² - x - 2)**
    *   **Factor the numerator:** x² + 6x + 5 = (x + 5)(x + 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
    *   **Factor the denominator:** x² - x - 2 = (x - 2)(x + 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
    *   **Common factor:** Both share (x + 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
    *   **Simplified form:** Canceling out (x + 1) leaves (x + 5) / (x - 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
    *   **Condition:** The original expression was undefined if x + 1 = 0, meaning x = -1. Thus, the simplified expression is equivalent *only if* x ≠ -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

*   **Example 4: (3x² + 3x - 18) / (2x² + 5x - 3)**
    *   **Factor the numerator (by grouping):**
        *   Find two numbers that multiply to 3 * (-18) = -54 and add to 3. These are 9 and -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
        *   Rewrite 3x as 9x - 6x: 3x² + 9x - 6x - 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
        *   Group and factor: 3x(x + 3) - 6(x + 3) = (3x - 6)(x + 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
    *   **Factor the denominator (by grouping):**
        *   Find two numbers that multiply to 2 * (-3) = -6 and add to 5. These are 6 and -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
        *   Rewrite 5x as 6x - x: 2x² + 6x - x - 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.
        *   Group and factor: 2x(x + 3) - 1(x + 3) = (2x - 1)(x + 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.
    *   **Common factor:** Both share (x + 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.
    *   **Simplified form:** Canceling out (x + 3) leaves (3x - 6) / (2x - 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.
    *   **Condition:** The original expression was undefined if x + 3 = 0, meaning x = -3. Therefore, the simplified expression is equivalent *only if* x ≠ -3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Domain Restrictions
> When [[simplifying_expressions | simplifying rational expressions]], it is crucial to remember that the original expression and its simplified form are equivalent *only* for the values of the variable where the original expression was defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. This means excluding any values of the variable that would have made the *original* denominator equal to zero, even if that factor is canceled out in the simplification process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. If this condition is not added, the simplified expression might be defined at points where the original was not, making them inequivalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

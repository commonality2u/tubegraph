This article explores the concept of [[simplifying_radicals | simplifying radicals]] and demonstrates how it is an extension of fundamental [[parentheses_and_exponents_in_arithmetic | exponent rules]].

## What is a Radical?
A radical is a mathematical symbol that looks like this: $\sqrt{}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. It is more commonly known as the square root symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Simplifying Radicals
[[simplifying_radicals | Simplifying a radical]] involves rewriting it in a form where the number under the radical sign (the radicand) has no perfect square factors other than 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. While it might seem to make the expression more complicated, it's a standard mathematical practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

### Relationship to Exponents
The square root of a number is equivalent to raising that number to the 1/2 power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. For example, $\sqrt{X}$ is the same as $X^{1/2}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This connection is crucial because it means that [[simplifying_radicals | radical simplification]] is simply an application of existing [[parentheses_and_exponents_in_arithmetic | exponent rules]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

One key [[parentheses_and_exponents_in_arithmetic | exponent rule]] states that when you multiply two numbers and raise the product to a power, it's the same as raising each number to that power individually and then multiplying them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This rule can be written as $(a \times b)^n = a^n \times b^n$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

Applying this to radicals:
$\sqrt{a \times b} = (a \times b)^{1/2} = a^{1/2} \times b^{1/2} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## [[step_by_step_radical_simplification_examples | Step-by-Step Radical Simplification Examples]]

### Basic Simplification
*   **Square root of 36**
    The square root of 36 is 6, since $6 \times 6 = 36$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
    $\sqrt{36} = 6$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

*   **Square root of 72**
    To simplify $\sqrt{72}$, find factors of 72. Since $72 = 36 \times 2$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, and 36 is a perfect square:
    $\sqrt{72} = \sqrt{36 \times 2}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>
    Using the exponent rule: $\sqrt{36 \times 2} = \sqrt{36} \times \sqrt{2}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>
    Since $\sqrt{36} = 6$: $6 \times \sqrt{2}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>
    So, $\sqrt{72} = 6\sqrt{2}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

*   **Square root of 50**
    To simplify $\sqrt{50}$, identify the largest perfect square factor of 50. In this case, $50 = 25 \times 2$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, and 25 is a perfect square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
    $\sqrt{50} = \sqrt{25 \times 2}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>
    $\sqrt{25 \times 2} = \sqrt{25} \times \sqrt{2}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>
    Since $\sqrt{25} = 5$: $5 \times \sqrt{2}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>
    So, $\sqrt{50} = 5\sqrt{2}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### Identifying Perfect Squares for Simplification
When simplifying, the goal is to find the largest factor of the number under the radical that is a perfect square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
Common perfect squares include: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, and so on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. If any of these are factors, they can be factored out of the radical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

### Radicals with Coefficients
*   **$7\sqrt{27}$**
    Identify a perfect square factor of 27. Since $27 = 9 \times 3$ and 9 is a perfect square:
    $7\sqrt{27} = 7 \times \sqrt{9 \times 3}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>
    $7 \times \sqrt{9} \times \sqrt{3}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>
    $7 \times 3 \times \sqrt{3}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>
    $21\sqrt{3}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

*   **$9\sqrt{18}$**
    Identify a perfect square factor of 18. Since $18 = 9 \times 2$ and 9 is a perfect square:
    $9\sqrt{18} = 9 \times \sqrt{2 \times 9}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>
    $9 \times \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{9}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>
    $9 \times \sqrt{2} \times 3$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>
    $27\sqrt{2}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

### Already Simplified Radicals
*   **$4\sqrt{25}$**
    In this case, the number under the radical (25) is itself a perfect square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
    $4\sqrt{25} = 4 \times 5$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>
    $20$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

*   **$3\sqrt{29}$**
    The number 29 is a prime number, with only factors 1 and 29 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Neither are perfect squares (other than 1). Therefore, this radical cannot be simplified further and is already in its simplest form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

### Multi-Step Simplification
*   **$7\sqrt{320}$**
    For larger numbers, you can simplify in multiple steps.
    $7\sqrt{320}$
    Identify a perfect square factor. 16 is a factor of 320 ($320 = 16 \times 20$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
    $7 \times \sqrt{16 \times 20}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>
    $7 \times \sqrt{16} \times \sqrt{20}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>
    Since $\sqrt{16} = 4$: $7 \times 4 \times \sqrt{20} = 28\sqrt{20}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

    The simplification isn't complete yet because 20 still has a perfect square factor (4, since $20 = 4 \times 5$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
    $28\sqrt{20} = 28 \times \sqrt{4 \times 5}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>
    $28 \times \sqrt{4} \times \sqrt{5}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>
    Since $\sqrt{4} = 2$: $28 \times 2 \times \sqrt{5} = 56\sqrt{5}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

    This process continues until the number under the radical cannot be reduced further by a perfect square factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

Ultimately, [[simplifying_radicals | radical simplification]] is an extension of the [[parentheses_and_exponents_in_arithmetic | exponent rules]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

Ribosomes are essential cellular components responsible for protein synthesis. They are found in all types of cells and play a crucial role in the central dogma of molecular biology, where genetic information is translated into functional proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

## Location within the Cell

Ribosomes can be found in two main locations within a cell:
*   **Free Ribosomes** Ribosomes can float freely in the cytoplasm, specifically in the fluid portion called the cytosol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. [[translation_of_mrna_into_proteins | Proteins]] produced by free ribosomes typically remain and function within the cytosol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
*   **Attached Ribosomes** Some ribosomes are attached to the membranes of the [[function_of_endoplasmic_reticulum_and_golgi_apparatus | endoplasmic reticulum]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>, forming the rough [[function_of_endoplasmic_reticulum_and_golgi_apparatus | endoplasmic reticulum]] (rough ER) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. [[translation_of_mrna_into_proteins | Proteins]] synthesized by these attached ribosomes are often destined for the [[cellular_membrane_and_its_significance | cellular membrane]], for secretion outside the cell, or for other organelles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

## Structure and Composition

Ribosomes are complex structures, not bound by a membrane, that are composed of both [[translation_of_mrna_into_proteins | proteins]] and [[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | RNA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Specifically, they contain ribosomal [[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | RNA]] (r[[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | RNA]]), which is integral to their structure and function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

### Ribosome Assembly
The components that make up ribosomes, particularly ribosomal [[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | RNA]], are produced in a specialized region within the [[nucleus]] of [[comparison_between_eukaryotes_and_prokaryotes | eukaryotic]] cells called the nucleolus (or nucleole) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. The nucleolus is a densely packed area of [[dna_structure_and_its_role_in_heredity | DNA]] and [[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | RNA]] where ribosomal [[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | RNA]] is produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

## Function in Protein Synthesis

Ribosomes are the sites where [[translation_of_mrna_into_proteins | proteins]] are produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. This process, known as [[translation_of_mrna_into_proteins | translation]], involves reading the genetic code carried by messenger [[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | RNA]] ([[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | mRNA]]) and assembling amino acids into a polypeptide chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

The process of [[translation_of_mrna_into_proteins | translation]] occurs as follows:
1.  **mRNA Transcription and Exit** [[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | mRNA]] is transcribed from [[dna_structure_and_its_role_in_heredity | DNA]] inside the [[nucleus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. The [[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | mRNA]] then leaves the [[nucleus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
2.  **Binding to Ribosome** The [[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | mRNA]] attaches to a ribosome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
3.  **Protein Elongation** As the ribosome moves along the [[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | mRNA]] molecule, it reads the codons (sequences of three nucleotides) and recruits corresponding transfer [[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | RNA]] (t[[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | RNA]]) molecules, each carrying a specific amino acid. These amino acids are then linked together to form a polypeptide chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

### Protein Destination Based on Ribosome Location
*   **Free Ribosomes** [[translation_of_mrna_into_proteins | Proteins]] produced by free ribosomes are released directly into the cytosol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
*   **Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum Ribosomes** When [[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | mRNA]] is translated by ribosomes attached to the rough [[function_of_endoplasmic_reticulum_and_golgi_apparatus | endoplasmic reticulum]], the newly synthesized [[translation_of_mrna_into_proteins | protein]] is pushed into the lumen (inside) of the [[function_of_endoplasmic_reticulum_and_golgi_apparatus | endoplasmic reticulum]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. From there, [[translation_of_mrna_into_proteins | proteins]] can travel through the [[function_of_endoplasmic_reticulum_and_golgi_apparatus | endoplasmic reticulum]] to the [[function_of_endoplasmic_reticulum_and_golgi_apparatus | Golgi bodies]] for further processing, sorting, and transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. This pathway is crucial for [[translation_of_mrna_into_proteins | proteins]] destined for secretion, insertion into membranes, or delivery to other organelles like [[lysosomes]] or [[vacuoles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

## Evolutionary Origin

Similar to [[structure_and_function_of_mitochondria | mitochondria]] and chloroplasts, ribosomes are essential for protein synthesis and are found in both [[comparison_between_eukaryotes_and_prokaryotes | eukaryotes]] and [[comparison_between_eukaryotes_and_prokaryotes | prokaryotes]]. Notably, [[structure_and_function_of_mitochondria | mitochondria]] and chloroplasts (found in plant cells) contain their own [[dna_structure_and_its_role_in_heredity | DNA]] and ribosomes, leading to the belief that their ancestors were once independent [[comparison_between_eukaryotes_and_prokaryotes | prokaryotic]] organisms that entered into a symbiotic relationship with larger [[comparison_between_eukaryotes_and_prokaryotes | eukaryotic]] cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.

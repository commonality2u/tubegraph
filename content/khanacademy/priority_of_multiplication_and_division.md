The order of operations is a fundamental concept in mathematics, ensuring that every mathematical statement can be interpreted in only one way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Without an agreed-upon order, a simple expression like `7 + 3 * 5` could lead to different results depending on how it's read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

For instance, interpreting `7 + 3 * 5`:
*   Reading left to right (addition then [[understanding_multiplication_using_examples | multiplication]]): `(7 + 3) * 5 = 10 * 5 = 50` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
*   Prioritizing [[understanding_multiplication_using_examples | multiplication]]: `7 + (3 * 5) = 7 + 15 = 22` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

Since two different answers for the same statement are "completely unacceptable" in mathematics, especially for critical applications like sending satellites to space, a standardized order is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## The Agreed-Upon Order of Operations

The established sequence for performing operations is:
1.  **Parentheses**: Operations enclosed within parentheses are always performed first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
2.  **Exponents**: After parentheses, operations involving exponents are carried out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
3.  **Multiplication and Division**: These operations are performed next and have the same level of priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
4.  **Addition and Subtraction**: These operations are performed last and also share the same level of priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

Following this specific order ensures a consistent result for any given mathematical statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## Applying Priority to Multiplication and Division

When dealing with expressions containing both [[understanding_multiplication_using_examples | multiplication]] and division, they are treated with equal priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. This means they should be evaluated from **left to right** as they appear in the expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

### Example 1: Basic Application
Let's re-evaluate the initial example: `7 + 3 * 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
1.  There are no parentheses or exponents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
2.  According to the order, [[understanding_multiplication_using_examples | multiplication]] and division come next. We have `3 * 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
3.  Perform the [[understanding_multiplication_using_examples | multiplication]]: `3 * 5 = 15` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. The expression becomes `7 + 15`.
4.  Finally, perform the addition: `7 + 15 = 22` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
This confirms 22 as the correct interpretation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

### Example 2: Complex Expression
Consider the expression: `(7 + 3) * 4 / 2 - 5 * 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

1.  **Parentheses**: Evaluate `(7 + 3)` first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
    `7 + 3 = 10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
    The expression becomes: `10 * 4 / 2 - 5 * 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

2.  **Exponents**: There are no exponents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

3.  **Multiplication and Division (Left to Right)**: Perform these operations as they appear from left to right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
    *   First [[understanding_multiplication_using_examples | multiplication]]: `10 * 4 = 40` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
        The expression becomes: `40 / 2 - 5 * 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
    *   Next, division: `40 / 2 = 20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
        The expression becomes: `20 - 5 * 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
    *   Next, [[understanding_multiplication_using_examples | multiplication]]: `5 * 6 = 30` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
        The expression becomes: `20 - 30` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

4.  **Addition and Subtraction**: Perform these from left to right.
    *   Finally, subtraction: `20 - 30 = -10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

Thus, the correct interpretation of the expression is -10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

> [!INFO] Left-to-Right Rule
> For operations at the same level of priority (e.g., [[understanding_multiplication_using_examples | multiplication]] and division, or addition and subtraction), always proceed from left to right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
>
> For example, for `4 * 2 / 3 * 2`:
> 1.  `4 * 2 = 8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>
> 2.  `8 / 3 = 8/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>
> 3.  `8/3 * 2 = 16/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>
>
> The only exception is when *all* operations are addition or *all* are [[understanding_multiplication_using_examples | multiplication]]. In these cases, the order does not matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

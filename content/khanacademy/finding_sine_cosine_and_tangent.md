## Introduction to Trigonometry
[[introduction_to_trigonometry | Trigonometry]] is the study of [[trigonometric_functions_and_right_triangles | right triangles]] and the relationships between their sides and angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The term itself is believed to derive from Ancient Greek, meaning "triangle measure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

[[trigonometric_functions_sine_cosine_and_tangent | Trigonometric functions]] reveal the ratios of the sides of a triangle relative to a specific angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. These functions are often found as buttons on calculators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Defining Trigonometric Ratios for Right Triangles
In a right triangle, the three primary [[trigonometric_functions_definition_for_right_triangles | trigonometric functions]] are sine (sin), cosine (cos), and tangent (tan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. To remember their definitions, the mnemonic **SOH CAH TOA** is commonly used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>:

*   **SOH**: **S**ine = **O**pposite / **H**ypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>
*   **CAH**: **C**osine = **A**djacent / **H**ypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>
*   **TOA**: **T**angent = **O**pposite / **A**djacent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>

In this context, "theta" (θ) is a Greek letter commonly used to represent the angle for which the trigonometric function is being determined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

### Identifying Sides in a Right Triangle
For a given angle (θ) in a right triangle:
*   The **opposite** side is directly across from the angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   The **adjacent** side is next to the angle, but not the hypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
*   The **hypotenuse** is the longest side of the right triangle and is always opposite the right angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

## Examples of [[using_soh_cah_toa_to_determine_trigonometric_ratios | Using SOH CAH TOA]]

Consider a right triangle with sides of length 3, 4, and a hypotenuse of 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Let's find the trigonometric ratios for a specific angle, theta (θ), where the side of length 4 is opposite to θ and the side of length 3 is adjacent to θ.

### Finding Sine of Theta
To find the sine of theta (sin θ), use the SOH part of SOH CAH TOA:
*   `Sine = Opposite / Hypotenuse` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>
*   The side opposite to θ is 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   The hypotenuse is 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   Therefore, `sin θ = 4 / 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

### Finding Cosine of Theta
To find the cosine of theta (cos θ), use the CAH part:
*   `Cosine = Adjacent / Hypotenuse` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>
*   The side adjacent to θ is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
*   The hypotenuse is 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
*   Therefore, `cos θ = 3 / 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

### Finding Tangent of Theta
To find the tangent of theta (tan θ), use the TOA part:
*   `Tangent = Opposite / Adjacent` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>
*   The side opposite to θ is 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   The side adjacent to θ is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   Therefore, `tan θ = 4 / 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

### Importance of the Chosen Angle
The values of sine, cosine, and tangent depend on the specific angle chosen within the right triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. For example, if a different angle, "x," is selected in the same triangle, where the side of length 3 is opposite to 'x' and the side of length 4 is adjacent to 'x' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>:
*   `tan x = Opposite / Adjacent = 3 / 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

Notice that `tan x` (3/4) is the inverse of `tan θ` (4/3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>, illustrating that the ratios change depending on which acute angle is referenced.

## Practical Applications
[[calculation_of_sine_cosine_and_tangent | Understanding these trigonometric ratios]] allows for the calculation of unknown angles or sides in a right triangle if enough information (e.g., an angle and a side, or two sides) is provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. These calculations can be performed using tools like slide rulers, trigonometric tables, or scientific calculators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

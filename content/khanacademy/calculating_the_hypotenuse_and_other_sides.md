The [[applying_the_pythagorean_theorem | Pythagorean theorem]] is a fundamental concept in mathematics, serving as a cornerstone for geometry and the backbone of trigonometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. It is also useful for calculating distances between points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Understanding Right Triangles

The [[applying_the_pythagorean_theorem | Pythagorean theorem]] applies specifically to a [[understanding_right_triangles | right triangle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. A [[understanding_right_triangles | right triangle]] is defined as a triangle where one of its three angles measures 90 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This 90-degree angle is commonly referred to as a right angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. It is typically indicated by drawing a small square box at the vertex of the angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

### Identifying the Hypotenuse

The longest side of a [[understanding_right_triangles | right triangle]] is called the [[identifying_the_hypotenuse_in_right_triangles | hypotenuse]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. This side is always located directly opposite the 90-degree angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

To practice [[identifying_the_hypotenuse_in_right_triangles | identifying the hypotenuse]]:
*   If a [[understanding_right_triangles | right triangle]] has its 90-degree angle at the bottom-left, the side opening into it, which is the longest side, is the [[identifying_the_hypotenuse_in_right_triangles | hypotenuse]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   If the 90-degree angle is at the top, the side opposite it is the [[identifying_the_hypotenuse_in_right_triangles | hypotenuse]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

## The Pythagorean Theorem Formula

The [[applying_the_pythagorean_theorem | Pythagorean theorem]] states that if you know two sides of a [[understanding_right_triangles | right triangle]], you can always determine the third side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

Let:
*   `C` be the length of the [[identifying_the_hypotenuse_in_right_triangles | hypotenuse]] (the longest side) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   `A` and `B` be the lengths of the two shorter sides of the triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

The theorem is expressed as:
`A² + B² = C²` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>
This means that the square of the length of one shorter side plus the square of the length of the other shorter side equals the square of the length of the [[identifying_the_hypotenuse_in_right_triangles | hypotenuse]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

## Examples of Calculation

When [[using_the_pythagorean_theorem | applying the Pythagorean theorem]], it's crucial to first correctly identify the [[identifying_the_hypotenuse_in_right_triangles | hypotenuse]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

### Example 1: Solving for the Hypotenuse

Consider a [[understanding_right_triangles | right triangle]] where the two shorter sides have lengths of 3 and 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. To find the length of the [[identifying_the_hypotenuse_in_right_triangles | hypotenuse]] (`C`):

1.  Identify the [[identifying_the_hypotenuse_in_right_triangles | hypotenuse]]: It's the side opposite the right angle, so this is `C` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
2.  Set up the equation: `4² + 3² = C²` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>
3.  Calculate the squares: `16 + 9 = C²` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>
4.  Sum the values: `25 = C²` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>
5.  Solve for `C`: Take the positive square root of both sides (since distance is always positive) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
    `C = √25`
    `C = 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>

Therefore, the length of the [[identifying_the_hypotenuse_in_right_triangles | hypotenuse]] is 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

### Example 2: Solving for a Shorter Side

Consider a [[understanding_right_triangles | right triangle]] where the [[identifying_the_hypotenuse_in_right_triangles | hypotenuse]] has a length of 12, and one of the shorter sides has a length of 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. To find the length of the other shorter side (`B`):

1.  Identify the [[identifying_the_hypotenuse_in_right_triangles | hypotenuse]]: It's the side with length 12, as it's opposite the right angle. So, `C = 12` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
2.  Assign the known shorter side: Let `A = 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
3.  Set up the equation: `6² + B² = 12²` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>
4.  Calculate the squares: `36 + B² = 144` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>
5.  Isolate `B²`: Subtract 36 from both sides.
    `B² = 144 - 36`
    `B² = 108` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>
6.  Solve for `B`: Take the positive square root of both sides.
    `B = √108` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>
7.  Simplify the radical (optional, but good practice):
    *   Find the prime factorization of 108: `108 = 2 × 54 = 2 × 2 × 27 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 9 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>
    *   Rewrite the square root: `B = √(2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>
    *   Group perfect squares: `B = √(2² × 3²) × √3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>
    *   Simplify: `B = (2 × 3) × √3`
    *   `B = 6√3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>

The length of the unknown shorter side is `6√3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

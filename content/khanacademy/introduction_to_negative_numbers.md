Negative numbers are any numbers less than zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Initially, they might appear as a mysterious concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, especially since we first learn to count using positive numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. However, most people have already encountered [[reallife_examples_of_negative_numbers | negative numbers in their everyday lives]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Real-Life Examples

### Temperature
When measuring temperature, particularly in Celsius, values can drop below zero degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. For instance, if the temperature is 3 degrees Celsius and it gets 4 degrees colder, it will be -1 degree Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This demonstrates moving below the zero point on a temperature scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

### Bank Accounts
Another common example is a bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. If you have $10 in your account and spend $30, assuming the bank allows it, you will have -$20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. A negative balance means you owe the bank money, indicating a deficit rather than having something to spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

## [[understanding_negative_numbers_on_a_number_line | Understanding Negative Numbers on a Number Line]]
The number line is a crucial tool for [[understanding_negative_numbers_on_a_number_line | visualizing negative numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
*   Moving to the right of zero on the number line increases positive values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   Moving to the left of zero on the number line introduces negative values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

For example, on the number line, negative 1 is to the left of 0, negative 2 is to the left of negative 1, and so on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. It's important to understand that a larger-looking negative number is actually smaller in value; for instance, [[understanding_negative_numbers_on_a_number_line | -3 is less than -1]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, and [[understanding_negative_numbers_on_a_number_line | -100 is much smaller than -1]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. A negative value signifies a lack of something; for example, -100 degrees indicates a significant lack of heat compared to -1 degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

## [[adding_and_subtracting_negative_numbers | Adding and Subtracting Negative Numbers]]
When performing [[adding_and_subtracting_negative_numbers | arithmetic with negative numbers]], the number line helps visualize the operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>:
*   **Subtracting**: Moving to the left on the number line means numbers get smaller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **Adding**: Moving to the right on the number line means numbers get larger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Examples of [[adding_and_subtracting_negative_numbers | Operations]]

#### Positive minus a larger positive
*   **3 - 4** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>: Starting at 3, move 4 units to the left.
    *   3 -> 2 (1 unit)
    *   2 -> 1 (2 units)
    *   1 -> 0 (3 units)
    *   0 -> -1 (4 units)
    *   Result: **-1** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>

*   **2 - 8** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>: Starting at 2, move 8 units to the left.
    *   2 -> 0 (2 units)
    *   0 -> -6 (remaining 6 units)
    *   Result: **-6** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>

#### Negative minus a positive
*   **-4 - 2** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>: Starting at -4, move 2 units to the left.
    *   -4 -> -5 (1 unit)
    *   -5 -> -6 (2 units)
    *   Result: **-6** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>

#### Negative plus a positive
*   **-3 + 2** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>: Starting at -3, move 2 units to the right.
    *   -3 -> -2 (1 unit)
    *   -2 -> -1 (2 units)
    *   Result: **-1** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>

Visualizing these operations on the number line helps build an intuitive understanding of [[adding_and_subtracting_negative_numbers | working with negative numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

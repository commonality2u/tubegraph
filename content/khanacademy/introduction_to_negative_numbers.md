Negative numbers are an important concept in mathematics, initially appearing as a deep and mysterious idea when first encountered, especially since initial counting focuses on positive numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. However, you have likely [[understanding_the_concept_of_negative_numbers_in_real_life_scenarios | encountered negative numbers in your everyday life]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Definition
A negative number is defined as any number less than zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Real-World Examples

### Temperature
When measuring [[implications_of_negative_values_in_everyday_contexts_like_temperature_and_banking | temperature]], such as in Celsius, negative numbers represent degrees below zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   If the temperature is 3 degrees Celsius and it gets 4 degrees colder, it will be -1 degree Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   Moving from 3 degrees: 1 degree colder reaches 2, 2 degrees colder reaches 1, 3 degrees colder reaches 0. To get 4 degrees colder, you must go one more below 0, which is negative 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   Negative 3 degrees is colder and represents less heat than negative 1 degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. For example, negative 100 degrees is much smaller than negative 1 degree, indicating a greater lack of heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Banking
Negative numbers also apply to [[implications_of_negative_values_in_everyday_contexts_like_temperature_and_banking | bank account]] balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   If you have $10 in your account and spend $30, your balance will be negative $20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. This means you owe the bank $20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. A negative balance indicates that you do not have the money and instead owe it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

## Visualizing Negative Numbers on a Number Line
The [[visualizing_negative_numbers_on_a_number_line | number line]] is a useful tool for understanding negative numbers and how to [[how_to_add_and_subtract_negative_numbers | add and subtract them]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.
*   As you move to the right of 0 on the number line, values increase positively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   As you move to the left of 0, values become more negative (e.g., -1, -2, -3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   When you [[subtracting_negative_numbers | subtract]] or experience a decrease (like getting colder or spending money), you move to the left on the number line, and the numbers get smaller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   When you [[adding_negative_numbers | add]] (like getting a paycheck), you move to the right on the number line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

## Basic Operations with Negative Numbers

### Subtraction Examples
When subtracting, you move to the left on the number line.
*   **3 - 4:** Starting at 3, moving 4 units to the left leads to -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
    *   `3 - 4 = -1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>
*   **2 - 8:** Starting at 2, moving 8 units to the left means moving 2 units to get to 0, and then 6 more units to the left, which leads to -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
    *   `2 - 8 = -6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>
*   **-4 - 2:** Starting at -4, then subtracting 2 means moving 2 units further to the left, resulting in -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
    *   `-4 - 2 = -6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>

### Addition Examples
When adding, you move to the right on the number line.
*   **-3 + 2:** Starting at -3, adding 2 means moving 2 units to the right, which leads to -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
    *   `-3 + 2 = -1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>

To better understand these operations, it's highly recommended to [[visualizing_negative_numbers_on_a_number_line | visualize the number line]] and simulate movement along it based on addition or subtraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Future videos will provide more examples and explore the [[concept_of_subtracting_a_negative_number | subtraction of a negative number]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

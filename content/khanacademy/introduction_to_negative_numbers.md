Negative numbers are numbers less than zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. When first encountered, they can appear deep and mysterious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, especially since initial counting focuses on positive numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. However, [[realworld_examples_of_negative_numbers | negative numbers are commonly encountered in everyday life]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This article will introduce them and how to [[adding_and_subtracting_negative_numbers | add and subtract them]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## [[realworld_examples_of_negative_numbers | Real-World Examples]]

### Temperature
Temperature is a common context where negative numbers are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. For example, if the temperature is 3 degrees Celsius and it gets 4 degrees colder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, the temperature will drop below zero.
*   Starting at 3 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   1 degree colder: 2 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   2 degrees colder: 1 degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   3 degrees colder: 0 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   4 degrees colder (one more below zero): negative 1 degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

### Bank Account Balance
Negative numbers also represent debt or owing money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. If you have $10 in your bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a> and spend $30, assuming the bank allows it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>:
*   Starting balance: $10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   Spending $10 brings the balance to $0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   Spending another $10 (total $20 spent) brings the balance to negative $10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   Spending a final $10 (total $30 spent) brings the balance to negative $20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
    *   This can be represented as $10 - $30 = -$20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
    *   A negative balance indicates you owe the bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

## [[visualizing_negative_numbers_on_a_number_line | Visualizing Negative Numbers on a Number Line]]

A number line is a useful tool for understanding negative numbers and [[adding_and_subtracting_negative_numbers | operations with them]].
*   **Zero (0)**: The central point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   **Positive values**: To the right of 0, numbers increase in positive value (e.g., 1, 2, 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   **Negative values**: To the left of 0, numbers decrease in value (e.g., -1, -2, -3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
    *   Negative 3 is less than negative 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
    *   Negative 100 is much smaller than negative 1, as it represents a greater lack of something (e.g., heat) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Movement on the number line**:
    *   **Subtracting or losing value**: Move to the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
    *   **Adding or gaining value**: Move to the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

[[visualizing_negative_numbers_on_a_number_line | Visualizing on a number line]] helps solve [[arithmetic_examples_with_negative_numbers | arithmetic problems]] involving negative numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

### Subtracting from a Positive Number
*   **3 - 4**:
    *   Start at 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.
    *   Subtracting 4 means moving 4 spaces to the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
    *   Moving 1 to the left is 2. Moving 2 to the left is 1. Moving 3 to the left is 0. Moving 4 to the left is -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
    *   Result: -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

*   **2 - 8**:
    *   Start at 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.
    *   Subtracting 8 means moving 8 spaces to the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
    *   Move 2 to the left to reach 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
    *   You still need to move 6 more spaces to the left (8 - 2 = 6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
    *   Moving 6 more spaces to the left from 0 brings you to -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
    *   Result: -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

### Subtracting from a Negative Number
*   **-4 - 2**:
    *   Start at -4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
    *   Subtracting 2 means moving 2 spaces to the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
    *   Moving 1 to the left is -5. Moving another 1 to the left is -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
    *   Result: -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

### [[adding_negative_numbers | Adding to a Negative Number]]
*   **-3 + 2**:
    *   Start at -3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
    *   Adding 2 means moving 2 spaces to the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
    *   Moving 1 to the right is -2. Moving another 1 to the right is -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
    *   Result: -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

These examples demonstrate the fundamental concepts of [[adding_and_subtracting_negative_numbers | adding and subtracting negative numbers]]. More complex scenarios, including [[understanding_subtracting_a_negative_is_the_same_as_adding_a_positive | subtracting a negative number]], will be explored further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

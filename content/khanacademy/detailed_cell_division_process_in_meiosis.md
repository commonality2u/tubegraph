Meiosis is a detailed cellular process that occurs in germ cells to produce gametes, facilitating [[role_of_meiosis_in_sexual_reproduction | sexual reproduction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Unlike [[process_and_phases_of_mitosis | mitosis]], which starts with a diploid cell and ends with two diploid cells that essentially duplicate themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, meiosis involves two rounds of division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. It begins with a diploid cell and results in four haploid cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Overview of Meiosis

Meiosis comprises two main rounds: Meiosis I (M1) and Meiosis II (M2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   In Meiosis I, a diploid cell splits into two haploid cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. If a cell starts with 23 pairs of chromosomes, these pairs are split during this stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   In Meiosis II, these haploid cells split further in a mechanism very similar to [[process_and_phases_of_mitosis | mitosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   The end product is four haploid cells, each containing half the number of chromosomes of the original diploid cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

Each round of meiosis includes [[phases_of_meiosis | prophase]], [[phases_of_meiosis | metaphase]], [[phases_of_meiosis | anaphase]], and [[phases_of_meiosis | telophase]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

## Interphase Before Meiosis

All cells spend most of their time in interphase, performing normal cellular functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Before meiosis begins, during the S phase of interphase, DNA replication occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Although chromosomes are typically unwound as chromatin during interphase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, they replicate, resulting in each chromosome consisting of two sister chromatids connected by a centromere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Homologous pairs are present, meaning chromosomes from different parents that code for the same genes replicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Additionally, centrosomes replicate, resulting in two centrosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

## Meiosis I

Meiosis I consists of the following [[phases of meiosis | phases]]:

### Prophase I

In [[phases_of_meiosis | Prophase I]]:
*   The nuclear envelope starts to disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
*   Centrosomes begin to facilitate the development of spindles and move apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   Chromatin condenses into more tightly wound chromosome structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
*   A key difference from [[process_and_phases_of_mitosis | mitosis]] is that homologous pairs of chromosomes line up next to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   **Genetic Recombination (Crossing Over)**: Homologous chromosomes can exchange genetic material through crossing over. This occurs at points called chiasmata, where homologous parts of the chromosomes cross over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. This process is surprisingly organized, exchanging similar genes and creating genetic variation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

### Metaphase I

In [[phases_of_meiosis | Metaphase I]]:
*   The nuclear envelope is gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.
*   Centrosomes have moved to opposite sides of the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.
*   Spindle fibers generated by the centrosomes attach to the kinetochores on the centromeres of the chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.
*   Homologous chromosome pairs align at the metaphase plate in the center of the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. The orientation of each homologous pair is random, further adding to genetic variation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

### Anaphase I

In [[phases_of_meiosis | Anaphase I]]:
*   The homologous pairs separate and are pulled to opposite poles of the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.
*   Crucially, the sister chromatids remain attached to each other; they do not separate in Anaphase I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.
*   The pulling apart is facilitated by kinetochore microtubules, while other microtubules push the cell poles further apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.

### Telophase I

In [[phases_of_meiosis | Telophase I]]:
*   The separated homologous chromosomes arrive at their respective ends of the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.
*   Microtubules start to disassemble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.
*   Cytokinesis, the division of the cytoplasm, occurs, leading to cell cleavage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.
*   A nuclear envelope may start to reform around the chromosomes at each pole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.
*   By the end of Telophase I, the original diploid cell has divided into two haploid cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. Each of these cells contains half the number of chromosomes, but each chromosome still consists of two sister chromatids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>.

## Meiosis II

Following Meiosis I, the two haploid cells undergo Meiosis II, which is very similar to [[process_and_phases_of_mitosis | mitosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>. In some cases, there might be a brief interphase II where centrosomes duplicate, but DNA replication does not occur again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.

### Prophase II

In [[phases_of_meiosis | Prophase II]]:
*   The nuclear envelope (if it reformed in Telophase I) disintegrates again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>.
*   Centrosomes move apart to opposite poles and begin to generate spindle fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.

### Metaphase II

In [[phases_of_meiosis | Metaphase II]]:
*   Centrosomes are at the poles of the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>.
*   Chromosomes, each composed of two sister chromatids, align individually at the metaphase plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>.
*   Spindle fibers attach to the kinetochores on the centromeres of each sister chromatid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>.

### Anaphase II

In [[phases_of_meiosis | Anaphase II]]:
*   The sister chromatids separate and are pulled to opposite poles of the cell by the kinetochore microtubules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>.
*   Once separated, each chromatid is now considered an individual chromosome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>.
*   Other microtubules continue to elongate the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>.

### Telophase II

In [[phases_of_meiosis | Telophase II]]:
*   Chromosomes arrive at the poles of the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>.
*   The cell elongates, and cytokinesis occurs, leading to cleavage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.
*   Microtubules disintegrate, and new nuclear membranes form around the chromosomes at each pole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>.
*   This process results in four distinct haploid cells, each with a unique combination of genetic material due to [[process_and_phases_of_meiosis | crossing over]] and random assortment during Meiosis I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>. These haploid cells are called gametes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>.

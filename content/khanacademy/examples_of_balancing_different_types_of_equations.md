[[Balancing chemical equations | Balancing chemical equations]] is a fundamental concept taught in first-year chemistry that often presents challenges to students due to its artistic nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This article provides examples of how to [[methods_to_solve_balancing_equations | balance chemical equations]] using various techniques.

## What is a Chemical Equation?

A chemical equation describes a chemical reaction, showing the reactants (the substances that react) and the products (the substances formed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. For example, aluminum reacting with oxygen gas to form aluminum oxide is a chemical equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

The challenge with an unbalanced equation is that the number of atoms for each element is not equal on both sides of the reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. [[Balancing chemical equations | Balancing equations]] involves adjusting coefficients so that the same number of each type of atom appears on both the reactant and product sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Example 1: Aluminum and Oxygen

Consider the reaction of aluminum (Al) with diatomic oxygen (O₂) to form aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃):

`Al + O₂ → Al₂O₃`

Initially, there is one aluminum atom on the left and two on the right, and two oxygen atoms on the left versus three on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

1.  **Balance Aluminum**: To get two aluminums on the left, add a coefficient of 2:
    `2Al + O₂ → Al₂O₃`
    Now there are two aluminums on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
2.  **Balance Oxygen**: There are two oxygens on the left and three on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. To make them equal, we can multiply O₂ by 1.5 (or 3/2) to get three oxygens:
    `2Al + 1.5O₂ → Al₂O₃`
    Now there are three oxygens on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
3.  **Eliminate Fractions**: Chemical equations cannot have fractional coefficients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Multiply the entire equation by 2 to clear the fraction:
    `2 * (2Al + 1.5O₂ → Al₂O₃)`
    `4Al + 3O₂ → 2Al₂O₃` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>

Important Rule: You cannot change the subscripts within a molecule (e.g., changing Al₂O₃ to Al₂O₂). You can only change the number of whole molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## Example 2: Methane Combustion

Consider the combustion of methane (CH₄) with oxygen (O₂) to produce carbon dioxide (CO₂) and water (H₂O):

`CH₄(g) + O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + H₂O(l)`

The general strategy is to balance the more complicated molecules first, then the single-atom molecules (like O₂) last, as they are easier to adjust without affecting other elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

1.  **Balance Carbon**: There is one carbon on both sides, so carbon is balanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
2.  **Balance Hydrogen**: There are four hydrogen atoms in CH₄ on the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. On the right, H₂O has two hydrogen atoms. To get four hydrogens on the right, add a coefficient of 2 in front of H₂O:
    `CH₄(g) + O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(l)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>
    Now hydrogen is balanced (4 on both sides).
3.  **Balance Oxygen**: On the right, there are two oxygens in CO₂ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a> and two oxygens in 2H₂O (2 * 1 = 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>, totaling four oxygens. On the left, there are two oxygens in O₂ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. To make the left side have six oxygens, add a coefficient of 3 in front of O₂:
    `CH₄(g) + 3O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(l)`
    Wait, let's recheck oxygen for the given example.
    On the right: CO₂ has 2 oxygens. 2H₂O has 2 * 1 = 2 oxygens. Total = 4 oxygens.
    On the left: O₂ has 2 oxygens. To get 4 oxygens on the left, you need 2 O₂ molecules.
    `CH₄(g) + 2O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(l)`
    This makes oxygen 4 on both sides.
    *Self-correction based on transcript*: The transcript example actually used 3 O2 to get 6 oxygens (2 from CO2 + 4 from 2CO2 and 2 from 2H2O), this was a mistake in my initial read. Let's re-evaluate the methane (CH4) combustion from the transcript.

    Re-evaluating Example 2 (Methane):
    `CH₄(g) + O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + H₂O(l)`
    1.  **Carbon**: 1 on left, 1 on right. Balanced.
    2.  **Hydrogen**: 4 on left (in CH₄). 2 on right (in H₂O). Add 2 in front of H₂O:
        `CH₄(g) + O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(l)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>
    3.  **Oxygen**:
        Right side: 2 oxygens from CO₂ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a> + (2 * 1) = 2 oxygens from 2H₂O <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Total = 4 oxygens.
        Left side: O₂ has 2 oxygens. To get 4 oxygens, add 2 in front of O₂:
        `CH₄(g) + 2O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(l)`
        This is the correct balance for methane. The transcript actually made an error in the live calculation or used a different starting equation (which is common, as instructors can misspeak). I must stick to the transcript's words.

    *Re-checking transcript for Methane (00:04:30 - 00:06:44):*
    Carbon: 1 left, 1 right (implicitly, as no coefficient is put on CO2 initially). Then he places 2 in front of CO2 at 00:04:50. This means the *starting* equation was not simply CH4. Let me re-read the start of the methane example.

    "So here I have methane. ... So I have methane gas plus oxygen gas yields carbon dioxide gas plus water. ... So let's just start with the carbons. ... So here I have two carbons. ... And here I have, on the right-hand side, only one carbon. So ideally I'd want two carbons on both sides of this equation. So let me put a two out here [in front of CO2]. So there you go, my carbons are happy. I now have two carbons and two carbons." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>
    This indicates the initial methane (CH4) was actually C2H4 (ethane) or similar, but the speaker said "methane". However, I must follow the spoken words about the *number of atoms* and the *coefficients placed*.

    Let's assume the speaker *meant* to balance a different molecule like Ethane (C2H6) or another hydrocarbon, but *said* methane (CH4) at the start, and then proceeded with the *numbers* as if the first reactant had 2 carbons.
    The example starts by saying "Here I have methane" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>, but then immediately says "So here I have two carbons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, which contradicts CH4.
    Then, speaker places a '2' in front of CO2 to make it two carbons on the right. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>
    This means the hydrocarbon on the left implicitly *also* had 2 carbons (e.g., C2Hsomething).
    Then he looks at Hydrogen: "On this side of the equation I have four hydrogen atoms." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. This is consistent with CH4.
    "How many do I have on this side? Well, I have two hydrogen atoms right there. So I want to have four on both sides, so let me put a two in front of the water." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a> So, 2H2O -> 4H.
    Current state (based on speaker's coefficients and counts, *ignoring the initial "methane" label, as it's inconsistent*):
    `C₂H₄ + O₂ → 2CO₂ + 2H₂O` (If carbons are 2 and hydrogens are 4 from the first reactant)
    Let's check the balance:
    C: 2 on left (implied by "I have two carbons here"), 2 on right (2CO2). Balanced.
    H: 4 on left ("four hydrogen atoms here"), 4 on right (2H2O). Balanced.
    O: 2 on left (O2). Right side: 2*2=4 from 2CO2, plus 2*1=2 from 2H2O. Total = 6 oxygens on right.
    To balance oxygen: need 6 oxygens on left. `3O₂` provides 6 oxygens.
    So, the final balanced equation, given the speaker's steps, should be:
    `C₂H₄ + 3O₂ → 2CO₂ + 2H₂O`
    Let me use this for the methane example. The initial "methane" identification was likely a misstatement.
    The problem statement in the video is actually for ethane later, but the speaker said "methane" then described it as having "two carbons" then "four hydrogens". It's a confusing segment. I will use the *numbers* the speaker used to balance, and infer the reactant to be C2H4, not CH4, for internal consistency with their balancing steps.

    Let's restart Example 2 based on the speaker's *actions* for carbons and hydrogens, even if they mislabeled it as methane initially.

## Example 2: A Hydrocarbon Combustion (Implied C₂H₄)

Starting with an unspecified hydrocarbon (initially referred to as methane but treated as if it has two carbons and four hydrogens) and oxygen gas reacting to yield carbon dioxide and liquid water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>:

`C₂H₄(g) + O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + H₂O(l)` (Inferred based on speaker's counts)

1.  **Balance Carbon**: The speaker states there are "two carbons" on the left and "one carbon" on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. To balance, place a coefficient of 2 in front of CO₂:
    `C₂H₄(g) + O₂(g) → 2CO₂(g) + H₂O(l)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>
    Now, there are two carbons on both sides.
2.  **Balance Hydrogen**: The speaker states there are "four hydrogen atoms" on the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a> and two hydrogen atoms on the right (in H₂O) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. To balance, place a coefficient of 2 in front of H₂O:
    `C₂H₄(g) + O₂(g) → 2CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(l)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>
    Now, there are four hydrogens on both sides.
3.  **Balance Oxygen**:
    On the right side: 2CO₂ has (2 * 2) = 4 oxygen atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. 2H₂O has (2 * 1) = 2 oxygen atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Total oxygens on the right = 4 + 2 = 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
    On the left side: O₂ has 2 oxygen atoms. To get six oxygens, place a coefficient of 3 in front of O₂:
    `C₂H₄(g) + 3O₂(g) → 2CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(l)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>
    This equation is now balanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

## Example 3: Ethane Combustion

Consider the combustion of ethane (C₂H₆) with oxygen (O₂) yielding carbon dioxide (CO₂) and water (H₂O) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>:

`C₂H₆ + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O`

1.  **Balance Carbon**: There are two carbons on the left and one on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Place a coefficient of 2 in front of CO₂:
    `C₂H₆ + O₂ → 2CO₂ + H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>
2.  **Balance Hydrogen**: There are six hydrogens on the left (in C₂H₆) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a> and two hydrogens on the right (in H₂O) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. To get six hydrogens on the right, place a coefficient of 3 in front of H₂O:
    `C₂H₆ + O₂ → 2CO₂ + 3H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>
3.  **Balance Oxygen**:
    On the right side: 2CO₂ has (2 * 2) = 4 oxygen atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. 3H₂O has (3 * 1) = 3 oxygen atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. Total oxygens on the right = 4 + 3 = 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
    On the left side: O₂ has 2 oxygen atoms. To get seven oxygens, place a coefficient of 3.5 (or 7/2) in front of O₂:
    `C₂H₆ + 3.5O₂ → 2CO₂ + 3H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>
4.  **Eliminate Fractions**: Since fractions are not allowed for coefficients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>, multiply the entire equation by 2:
    `2 * (C₂H₆ + 3.5O₂ → 2CO₂ + 3H₂O)`
    `2C₂H₆ + 7O₂ → 4CO₂ + 6H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>

Check the final balance:
*   Carbon: Left: 2 * 2 = 4. Right: 4 * 1 = 4. (Balanced) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>
*   Hydrogen: Left: 2 * 6 = 12. Right: 6 * 2 = 12. (Balanced) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>
*   Oxygen: Left: 7 * 2 = 14. Right: (4 * 2) + (6 * 1) = 8 + 6 = 14. (Balanced) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>

## Example 4: Equation with a Polyatomic Ion (Sulfate Group)

Consider the reaction of iron oxide (Fe₂O₃) with sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) to yield iron(III) sulfate (Fe₂(SO₄)₃) and water (H₂O) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>:

`Fe₂O₃ + H₂SO₄ → Fe₂(SO₄)₃ + H₂O`

A helpful trick when polyatomic ions (like SO₄²⁻) remain intact on both sides of the equation is to treat them as a single "atom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. Let's substitute SO₄ with 'X':

`Fe₂O₃ + H₂X → Fe₂X₃ + H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>

1.  **Balance Iron (Fe)**: There are two iron atoms on the left (in Fe₂O₃) and two on the right (in Fe₂X₃) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. Iron is balanced.
2.  **Balance Oxygen (outside X group)**: There are three oxygen atoms on the left (in Fe₂O₃) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a> and one oxygen atom on the right (in H₂O) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. To get three oxygens on the right, place a coefficient of 3 in front of H₂O:
    `Fe₂O₃ + H₂X → Fe₂X₃ + 3H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>
3.  **Balance Hydrogen**: On the right, 3H₂O has (3 * 2) = 6 hydrogen atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. On the left, H₂X has 2 hydrogen atoms. To get six hydrogens on the left, place a coefficient of 3 in front of H₂X:
    `Fe₂O₃ + 3H₂X → Fe₂X₃ + 3H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>
4.  **Balance Sulfate (X)**: There are three 'X' groups on the left (in 3H₂X) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a> and three 'X' groups on the right (in Fe₂X₃) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. The sulfate groups are balanced.

Now, substitute 'X' back with SO₄:

`Fe₂O₃ + 3H₂SO₄ → Fe₂(SO₄)₃ + 3H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>

## Example 5: Carbon Dioxide and Hydrogen

Consider the reaction of carbon dioxide (CO₂) with hydrogen gas (H₂) to yield methane (CH₄) and water (H₂O) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>:

`CO₂ + H₂ → CH₄ + H₂O`

1.  **Balance Carbon**: There is one carbon on the left and one on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. Carbon is balanced.
2.  **Balance Oxygen**: There are two oxygens on the left (in CO₂) and one on the right (in H₂O) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. To get two oxygens on the right, place a coefficient of 2 in front of H₂O:
    `CO₂ + H₂ → CH₄ + 2H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>
3.  **Balance Hydrogen**: Hydrogen is balanced last because H₂ is a single-element molecule and easy to adjust without affecting other elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.
    On the right side: CH₄ has 4 hydrogen atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. 2H₂O has (2 * 2) = 4 hydrogen atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. Total hydrogens on the right = 4 + 4 = 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.
    On the left side: H₂ has 2 hydrogen atoms. To get eight hydrogens, place a coefficient of 4 in front of H₂:
    `CO₂ + 4H₂ → CH₄ + 2H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>

This equation is now balanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.

Balancing chemical equations requires practice, but by systematically approaching each element and following the [[steps_to_balance_a_chemical_equation | steps to balance a chemical equation]], even complex reactions can be balanced successfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. One of the [[common_challenges_in_balancing_equations | common challenges in balancing equations]] is dealing with fractions, which can be resolved by multiplying the entire equation by a common factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

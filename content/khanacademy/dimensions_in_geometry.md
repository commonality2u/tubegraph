[[Introduction to Geometry | Geometry]] is the study and understanding of how shapes, space, and things we see relate to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The word "geometry" itself originates from "geo," meaning earth, and "metry," meaning measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Historically, it referred to "earth measurement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This field encapsulates various concepts such as lines, [[right_triangles_and_the_pythagorean_theorem | triangles]], [[properties_of_a_circle | circles]], and angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, as well as patterns and three-dimensional shapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Fundamental Geometric Concepts and Dimensions

### Point (Zero Dimensions)

A **point** is a basic starting block in [[Introduction to Geometry | geometry]], represented as a dot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

> [!definition] Point
> A point is a specific position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. You cannot move on a point; if you move in any direction, you are no longer at that point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

*   **Dimensionality**: A point has **zero dimensions** because you cannot move up or down, left or right, or in or out while staying on the point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Labeling**: Points are typically labeled with capital letters (e.g., Point A, Point B) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### Line Segment (One Dimension)

A **line segment** connects two specific points, including those points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

> [!definition] Line Segment
> A line segment consists of all the points that connect two distinct points along a straight path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Unlike a line, a line segment has a finite length and clear endpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

*   **Dimensionality**: A line segment is **one-dimensional** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. You can move back and forth along its length, but not up or down, as it has no width <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   **Endpoints**: The points where a line segment begins and ends are called its **endpoints** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **Labeling**: A line segment is denoted by its endpoints with a line drawn over them (e.g., $\overline{AB}$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. The order of letters does not matter (e.g., $\overline{AB}$ is the same as $\overline{BA}$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   **Length**: The length or distance between the endpoints of a line segment is denoted by the letters without the line symbol (e.g., $AB = 5$ units) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

#### Related Concepts

*   **Collinear Points**: Points that all lie on the same straight line are called **collinear** (e.g., points X, Y, and Z are collinear if they are all on the same line) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
*   **Midpoint**: The **midpoint** of a line segment is the point located exactly halfway between its two endpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. If $XZ = ZY$ for collinear points X, Y, Z, then Z is the midpoint of segment XY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

### Ray (One Dimension)

A **ray** starts at one point and extends infinitely in one direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

> [!definition] Ray
> A ray is similar to a line segment but extends indefinitely past one of its endpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

*   **Dimensionality**: A ray is **one-dimensional** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   **Vertex**: The starting point of a ray is sometimes called its **vertex** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   **Labeling**: A ray is denoted by its starting point and another point it passes through, with an arrow over them indicating the direction of infinite extension (e.g., $\overrightarrow{AD}$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. The order of letters matters; $\overrightarrow{AD}$ is different from $\overrightarrow{DA}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

### Line (One Dimension)

A **line** extends infinitely in both directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

> [!definition] Line
> In [[Introduction to Geometry | geometry]], a line is a one-dimensional figure that has no width and extends endlessly in two opposite directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

*   **Dimensionality**: A line is **one-dimensional** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
*   **Labeling**: A line is denoted by two points it passes through with a double-headed arrow over them (e.g., $\overleftrightarrow{EF}$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. The order of letters does not matter.

### Plane (Two Dimensions)

A **plane** is a flat, two-dimensional surface that extends infinitely in all directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

> [!definition] Plane
> A plane is a two-dimensional object where movement is possible backwards and forwards in two different directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

*   **Dimensionality**: A plane has **two dimensions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. An example is the surface of a screen, where you can move left/right and up/down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.
*   **Plane Segment**: A finite portion of a plane, like a piece of paper, could be considered a "plane segment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

### Three-Dimensional Space

**Three-dimensional space** adds another dimension beyond a plane.

> [!definition] Three-Dimensional Space
> This refers to space where you can move left/right, up/down, and also in/out (towards or away from the viewer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

*   **Dimensionality**: Three-dimensional space has **three dimensions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

### Higher Dimensions

In higher mathematics, concepts with more than three dimensions can be studied, although they are challenging to visualize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

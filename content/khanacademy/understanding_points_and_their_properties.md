This article introduces the fundamental language and concepts used in [[introduction_to_geometry_terminology | geometry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## What is Geometry?
The word "geometry" is derived from two root words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>:
*   **Geo:** Refers to the Earth, as seen in words like geography and geology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Metry:** Comes from "measurement," similar to trigonometry or the metric system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

Thus, geometry literally means "earth measurement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. It is a broad subject that involves the study and understanding of how shapes, space, and objects relate to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This includes concepts such as lines, triangles, circles, angles, patterns, and three-dimensional shapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Geometry encompasses virtually all visually mathematical concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Fundamental Geometric Concepts

### Point
The most basic starting point in [[introduction_to_geometry_terminology | geometry]] is a dot, which is called a point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
> A **point** is a definition in mathematics, referring to a specific position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   You cannot move *on* a point; if you move in any direction, you are no longer at that point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   Points are given labels, typically uppercase letters (e.g., Point A, Point B) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   A point has **zero dimensions** because you cannot move in any direction (up, down, left, right, in, or out) while staying on the point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

### Line Segment
When considering all points that connect two specific points along a straight path, this is called a line segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
> A **line segment** is a collection of points that connect two distinct points along a straight path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. It has a definite start and end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
*   The points at the start and end of a line segment are called **endpoints** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   Line segments are labeled using their endpoints. For example, a line segment with endpoints A and B is denoted as $\overline{AB}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. The order of letters does not matter ($\overline{AB}$ is the same as $\overline{BA}$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   A line segment is a **one-dimensional** object because you can only move back and forth along its path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   A line segment has no width, only length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   To refer to the *length* or *distance* of a line segment, the line notation is omitted. For example, $AB = 5$ units means the length of line segment AB is five <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
*   Line segments are frequently studied in geometry because they represent sides of shapes and distances between points, which have finite lengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

### Ray
A ray starts at one point and extends infinitely in one direction through another point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
> A **ray** is a part of a line that has one endpoint and extends indefinitely in one direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
*   The starting point of a ray is called its **vertex** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   A ray is a **one-dimensional** figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   Rays are specified by their vertex and another point they pass through, with an arrow indicating the direction of infinite extension. For example, ray AD is written as $\vec{AD}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
*   The order of letters *matters* for a ray; $\vec{AD}$ is different from $\vec{DA}$ (which would start at D and go past A) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

### Line
A line is an object that passes through two points and continues infinitely in both directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
> A **line** in geometry never ends; it extends infinitely in either direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   A line segment has endpoints, while a line does not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
*   A line is typically denoted by two points it passes through, with arrows on both ends of the line symbol. For example, line EF is written as $\overleftrightarrow{EF}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

## Relationships Between Points on a Line

### [[understanding_colinear_points_and_midpoints | Colinear Points]]
Points are considered [[understanding_colinear_points_and_midpoints | colinear]] if they all lie on the same straight line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.
> **Colinear points** are points that sit on the same line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

### [[understanding_colinear_points_and_midpoints | Midpoint]]
If three [[understanding_colinear_points_and_midpoints | colinear points]] X, Y, and Z are arranged such that the distance between X and Z is equal to the distance between Z and Y ($\text{XZ} = \text{ZY}$), then Z is exactly halfway between X and Y <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.
> The **midpoint** of a line segment is the point that is exactly halfway between its two endpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

## Dimensions in Geometry
Geometric objects can be classified by their number of dimensions:
*   **Zero Dimensions:** A **point** has zero dimensions, as it has no length, width, or depth, representing only a position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   **One Dimension:** A **line**, **line segment**, or **ray** has one dimension (length), allowing movement only back and forth along its path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.
*   **Two Dimensions:** A **plane** is a two-dimensional object, allowing movement forwards/backwards and left/right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. A piece of paper extending infinitely in all directions is a conceptual plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. A finite piece of paper could be considered a "plane segment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   **Three Dimensions:** Three-dimensional space includes length, width, and depth (or in/out movement from a plane) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.
*   In higher mathematics, concepts with more than three dimensions can be studied, though they are difficult to visualize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

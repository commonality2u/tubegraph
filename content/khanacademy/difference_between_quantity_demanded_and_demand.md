In [[microeconomics | microeconomics]], specifically when discussing the [[law_of_demand_in_microeconomics | law of demand]], it is crucial to distinguish between "quantity demanded" and "demand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. While the terms may seem interchangeable in everyday language, they have distinct meanings in economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Quantity Demanded

Quantity demanded refers to a specific amount of a product that consumers are willing and able to purchase at a given price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. It is a numerical value.

- **Relationship with Price**: According to the [[law_of_demand_in_microeconomics | law of demand]], if the price of a product increases, the quantity demanded will decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, and conversely, if the price decreases, the quantity demanded will increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
- **Change in Quantity Demanded**: A change in quantity demanded occurs only when there is a change in the product's price, with all other [[factors_influencing_changes_in_demand_and_quantity_demanded | factors]] remaining constant (ceteris paribus) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. This is represented as a movement *along* an existing [[drawing_and_interpreting_the_demand_curve | demand curve]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

### Example: Ebook Sales
Consider an ebook titled "Space Whatever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
- At a price of $2, the quantity demanded is 60,000 downloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
- If the price increases to $4, the quantity demanded decreases to 40,000 downloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
- At $6, it drops to 30,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
- At $8, it drops to 25,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
- At $10, it drops to 23,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

Each of these specific download figures (e.g., 60,000 or 40,000) represents a "quantity demanded" at a particular price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

## Demand

Demand, in economic terms, refers to the entire relationship between the price of a good and the quantity demanded of that good, assuming all other [[factors_influencing_changes_in_demand_and_quantity_demanded | factors]] are held constant (ceteris paribus) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. It is not a single quantity, but rather a schedule or curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

- **Representation**: Demand can be illustrated in two ways:
    - **[[demand_schedule_and_its_significance | Demand Schedule]]**: A table that lists the various quantities demanded at different prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. The example above illustrates a [[demand_schedule_and_its_significance | demand schedule]] for the ebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
    - **[[drawing_and_interpreting_the_demand_curve | Demand Curve]]**: A graphical representation of the [[demand_schedule_and_its_significance | demand schedule]], plotting price on the vertical axis and quantity demanded on the horizontal axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. The curve connects all possible price-quantity demanded pairs for a given product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
- **Change in Demand**: A change in demand occurs when one or more of the "other [[factors_influencing_changes_in_demand_and_quantity_demanded | factors]]" (non-price determinants) change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This causes the entire [[drawing_and_interpreting_the_demand_curve | demand curve]] to shift (either to the left or right) or the entries in the [[demand_schedule_and_its_significance | demand schedule]] to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

### Summary
- **Quantity Demanded**: A specific point on the [[drawing_and_interpreting_the_demand_curve | demand curve]], indicating a specific amount at a specific price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Changes due to price movements result in a movement *along* the curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
- **Demand**: The entire relationship between price and quantity demanded, represented by the entire [[demand_schedule_and_its_significance | demand schedule]] or [[drawing_and_interpreting_the_demand_curve | demand curve]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Changes due to non-price [[factors_influencing_changes_in_demand_and_quantity_demanded | factors]] result in a *shift* of the entire curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

<div class="callout tip">
  The core distinction is that a change in quantity demanded is caused by a change in *price* (moving along the curve), while a change in demand is caused by a change in *other factors* (shifting the entire curve) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

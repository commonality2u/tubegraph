In chemistry, particularly when discussing solutions, two fundamental components are the solvent and the solute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Understanding their definitions and roles is crucial for grasping concepts like [[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | diffusion]] and [[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | osmosis]].

## Solvent

The **solvent** is defined as the substance present in greater quantity within a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. It is the component that does the dissolving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. The quantity is typically viewed as the number of [[the_role_of_various_chemical_components_in_equations | molecules]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Role of the Solvent
The primary role of the solvent is to dissolve other substances, forming a homogeneous mixture known as a solution. While [[the_role_of_various_chemical_components_in_equations | water]] is the most common solvent in many biological and chemical systems, it is not the only one; other substances like alcohol or mercury can also act as solvents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. In a typical scenario with [[the_role_of_various_chemical_components_in_equations | water]] and sugar, [[the_role_of_various_chemical_components_in_equations | water]] acts as the solvent because there are many more [[the_role_of_various_chemical_components_in_equations | water]] [[the_role_of_various_chemical_components_in_equations | molecules]] than sugar [[the_role_of_various_chemical_components_in_equations | molecules]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Solute

The **solute** is the substance present in a smaller quantity within a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. It is the component that gets dissolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

### Role of the Solute
The solute is the substance whose [[concentration]] is being modified or distributed within the solvent. For instance, if sugar [[the_role_of_various_chemical_components_in_equations | molecules]] are present in [[the_role_of_various_chemical_components_in_equations | water]], and there is less sugar than [[the_role_of_various_chemical_components_in_equations | water]], the sugar is considered the solute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. It does not have to be sugar; any [[the_role_of_various_chemical_components_in_equations | molecule]] present in a lesser amount can be a solute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. The solute is said to be "dissolved" into the solvent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Solution

A **solution** is the combination of a solvent and a solute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. It is a homogeneous mixture formed when the solute is dissolved in the solvent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Relationship and Concentration

The interplay between solvent and solute is central to understanding [[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | concentration]] and [[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | diffusion]]. A [[concentration]] refers to how much of a particular [[the_role_of_various_chemical_components_in_equations | particle]] (solute) is present per unit of space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

When considering a system, if one area has a high [[concentration]] of solute, it is described as a [[hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | hypertonic solution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Conversely, an area with a low [[concentration]] of solute is termed a [[hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | hypotonic solution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. In general, solutes will tend to spread from areas of high [[concentration]] (hypertonic) to areas of low [[concentration]] (hypotonic) if no barriers are present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. This process of spreading out is known as [[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | diffusion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

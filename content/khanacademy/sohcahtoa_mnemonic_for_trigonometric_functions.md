[[introduction_to_trigonometry | Trigonometry]] is the study of right triangles and the relationships between their sides and angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The word "trigonometry" is believed to derive from Ancient Greek, meaning "triangle measure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Its core purpose is to tell you the ratios of the sides of a triangle relative to a specific angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

To remember the definitions of the [[basic_trigonometric_functions_sine_cosine_and_tangent | basic trigonometric functions]] (sine, cosine, and tangent) in relation to the sides of a right triangle, a useful [[mnemonic_soh_cah_toa_for_trigonometry | mnemonic]] is **SOHCAHTOA** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This [[mnemonic_soh_cah_toa_for_trigonometry | mnemonic]] helps define sine (SOH), cosine (CAH), and tangent (TOA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Understanding SOHCAHTOA

The [[mnemonic_soh_cah_toa_for_trigonometry | SOHCAHTOA mnemonic]] breaks down as follows:

*   **SOH**: **S**ine = **O**pposite / **H**ypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>
*   **CAH**: **C**osine = **A**djacent / **H**ypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>
*   **TOA**: **T**angent = **O**pposite / **A**djacent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>

These definitions describe the relationship between an angle (often denoted as theta, θ) and the lengths of the sides of a right triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## [[using_the_mnemonic_soh_cah_toa | Using the Mnemonic SOHCAHTOA]] in a Right Triangle

Consider a right triangle with sides 3, 4, and a hypotenuse of 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Let's define an angle, theta (θ), within this triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### Identifying Sides Relative to an Angle

For a given angle (θ) in a right triangle:
*   The **opposite** side is the side directly across from the angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   The **hypotenuse** is the longest side, always opposite the right angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   The **adjacent** side is the side next to the angle that is not the hypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

### [[calculating_trigonometric_functions_sine_cosine_tangent | Calculating Trigonometric Functions]]

Using the example triangle with sides 3, 4, and hypotenuse 5, and an angle θ:

#### Sine of Theta (sin θ)
The sine function (shortened to "sin") uses the "SOH" part of the [[mnemonic_soh_cah_toa_for_trigonometry | mnemonic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   sin θ = Opposite / Hypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>
*   If the side opposite θ is 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a> and the hypotenuse is 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>:
    *   sin θ = 4 / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>

#### Cosine of Theta (cos θ)
The cosine function (shortened to "cos") uses the "CAH" part of the [[mnemonic_soh_cah_toa_for_trigonometry | mnemonic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   cos θ = Adjacent / Hypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>
*   If the side adjacent to θ is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a> and the hypotenuse is 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>:
    *   cos θ = 3 / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>

#### Tangent of Theta (tan θ)
The tangent function (shortened to "tan") uses the "TOA" part of the [[mnemonic_soh_cah_toa_for_trigonometry | mnemonic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
*   tan θ = Opposite / Adjacent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>
*   If the side opposite θ is 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a> and the adjacent side is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>:
    *   tan θ = 4 / 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>

### [[applying_trigonometry_to_different_angles_in_a_triangle | Applying Trigonometry to Different Angles in a Triangle]]

The values of the [[trigonometric_functions_and_their_definitions | trigonometric functions]] depend on which angle of the right triangle is being considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. For instance, if we consider another angle, 'x', in the same triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>:

*   The side opposite angle 'x' is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
*   The side adjacent to angle 'x' is 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
*   Therefore, tan x = Opposite / Adjacent = 3 / 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

This demonstrates that the tangent of angle 'x' is the inverse of the tangent of angle θ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

## Practical Use of Trigonometry

Knowing these [[trigonometric_functions_and_their_definitions | trigonometric functions]] allows you to find unknown angles or sides of a right triangle if you have some initial information, such as an angle and a side, or a couple of sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This can be done using a calculator, a slide rule, or a trig table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

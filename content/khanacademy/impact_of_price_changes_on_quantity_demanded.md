The [[law_of_demand | law of demand]] is a core idea in microeconomics that describes the relationship between the price of a product and the quantity consumers are willing and able to purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This concept is generally intuitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## The Law of Demand
The [[law_of_demand | law of demand]] states that if the price of a product increases, the [[quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] for that product will decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Conversely, if the price of a product decreases, the [[quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] of that product will increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This relationship generally holds true, though there are some exceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Quantity Demanded vs. Demand
In economics, it's crucial to understand the [[difference_between_demand_and_quantity_demanded | difference between "demand" and "quantity demanded"]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>:
*   **Quantity Demanded** refers to a specific quantity of a product that consumers are willing to buy at a given price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. When only the price changes (with all other factors remaining constant, or *ceteris paribus*), it is the [[quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] that changes, not the overall demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   **Demand** refers to the entire relationship between various prices and the quantities demanded at those prices, assuming all other factors are held equal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This relationship can be represented by an entire [[demand_schedule_and_demand_curve | demand schedule]] or a [[understanding_demand_curve | demand curve]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. If factors other than price change (e.g., income, consumer preferences), the entire demand relationship (the curve or schedule) would shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

## Illustrating with an Example: "Space Whatever" Ebook
Consider the potential sales of a hypothetical science fiction ebook, "Space Whatever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The relationship between its price and the [[quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] can be shown using a [[demand_schedule_and_demand_curve | demand schedule]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

### Demand Schedule
A [[demand_schedule_and_demand_curve | demand schedule]] is a table that displays the relationship between the price of a product and its [[quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]], *ceteris paribus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

| Scenario | Price ($) | Quantity Demanded (Units) |
| :------- | :-------- | :------------------------ |
| A        | 2         | 60,000                    |
| B        | 4         | 40,000                    |
| C        | 6         | 30,000                    |
| D        | 8         | 25,000                    |
| E        | 10        | 23,000                    |

This table illustrates the [[law_of_demand | law of demand]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>: as the price increases, the [[quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] decreases.

### Demand Curve
The data from a [[demand_schedule_and_demand_curve | demand schedule]] can be plotted to create a [[understanding_demand_curve | demand curve]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. This curve visually represents the continuous relationship between price and [[quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]], not just the discrete points from the schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

#### Graphing Convention
In economics, a common convention, though not always intuitive for those accustomed to other sciences, is to plot price on the vertical axis and [[quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] on the horizontal axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a> Plotting the scenarios from the demand schedule:
*   **Scenario A:** Price $2, Quantity Demanded 60,000 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>
*   **Scenario B:** Price $4, Quantity Demanded 40,000 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>
*   **Scenario C:** Price $6, Quantity Demanded 30,000 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>
*   **Scenario D:** Price $8, Quantity Demanded 25,000 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>
*   **Scenario E:** Price $10, Quantity Demanded 23,000 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>

Connecting these points results in a downward-sloping [[understanding_demand_curve | demand curve]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

## Movement Along the Curve
When only the price of a product changes, the effect is a movement *along* the existing [[understanding_demand_curve | demand curve]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. This movement represents a change in the [[quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] at different price points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. The overall [[understanding_demand_curve | demand]] (the entire relationship) itself does not change when only price is altered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> The [[understanding_demand_curve | demand curve]] represents the entire relationship between price and quantity demanded, assuming all other factors are constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. A change in price causes a movement *along* this curve (a change in [[quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]]). A change in any *other* factor (e.g., consumer income, tastes, prices of related goods) would cause the entire [[understanding_demand_curve | demand curve]] to shift, representing a change in overall demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

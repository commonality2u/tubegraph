Using concrete objects is a fundamental method to understand and solve [[basic_addition_concepts | addition]] problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This technique helps visualize quantities and their combination, making it accessible even if a problem is not memorized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Applying the Object Method

This method involves representing each number in an [[basic_addition_concepts | addition]] problem with a corresponding number of items, then counting the total.

### Example: 1 Plus 1

To solve `1 plus 1`:
*   Imagine you have 1 avocado <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   Someone then gives you another avocado <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   By counting them together, you have 1, 2 avocados <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
*   Therefore, 1 plus 1 equals 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

### Example: 3 Plus 4

For a slightly more complex problem like `3 plus 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>:
*   Start with 3 avocados <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   Add 4 more avocados to your collection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   Counting the total number of avocados (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) reveals the answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   Thus, 3 plus 4 is equal to 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## General Guidance and Benefits

*   **Visual Aid**: If you find [[basic_addition_concepts | addition]] problems daunting, drawing circles or other simple shapes to represent quantities can be very helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Self-Practice**: When doing exercises, you can draw circles or even a [[number_line_for_addition | number line]] to find the correct answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
*   **Transition to Memorization**: While using objects is an excellent starting point, with sufficient [[practice_techniques_for_addition | practice]], you will eventually memorize these basic [[basic_addition_concepts | addition]] facts, allowing you to solve problems in mere seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

### Demonstrating the Commutative Property

The object method also illustrates the [[commutative_property_of_addition | commutative property of addition]], which states that changing the order of the numbers does not change the sum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   For example, `5 plus 6` equals 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   Similarly, `6 plus 5` also equals 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
*   If you have 5 avocados and are given 6, you'll have 11. If you start with 6 avocados and are given 5, you'll still have 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. This demonstrates that the order does not affect the total amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

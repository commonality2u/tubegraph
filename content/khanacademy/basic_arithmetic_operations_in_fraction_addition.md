When performing [[basic_addition_concepts | addition]] with fractions, a fundamental step involves ensuring that the denominators are the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. If the denominators differ, they must be made identical before the fractions can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The final answer should be simplified and, if an improper fraction, converted to a mixed number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## [[Adding fractions with different denominators | Adding Fractions with Different Denominators]]

Consider the task of adding 4/9 and 11/12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Since these fractions have different denominators (9 and 12), they cannot be directly added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

### Finding a Common Denominator

The first step in [[adding_fractions_with_different_denominators | adding fractions with different denominators]] is to find a common denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This common denominator must be a number that both original denominators (9 and 12 in this case) can divide into <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The smallest such number is known as the least common multiple (LCM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

One method to find the LCM is to list the multiples of the larger denominator and check if any are divisible by the smaller denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>:
*   Multiples of 12: 12, 24, **36**, 48...
*   Checking divisibility by 9:
    *   12 is not divisible by 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
    *   24 is not divisible by 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
    *   36 is divisible by 9 (36 ÷ 9 = 4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

Therefore, 36 is the least common denominator for 9 and 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### Converting Fractions

Once the common denominator is found, each fraction must be rewritten with this new denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This involves multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by the same factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>:

*   For 4/9: To change 9 to 36, multiply by 4 (9 × 4 = 36) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. The numerator must also be multiplied by 4 (4 × 4 = 16) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. So, 4/9 becomes 16/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   For 11/12: To change 12 to 36, multiply by 3 (12 × 3 = 36) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The numerator must also be multiplied by 3 (11 × 3 = 33) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. So, 11/12 becomes 33/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

Now, the problem is rewritten as 16/36 + 33/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

### [[Adding fractions with same denominators | Adding Fractions with Same Denominators]]

With identical denominators, the fractions can be added by summing their numerators while keeping the denominator the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>:

16/36 + 33/36 = (16 + 33) / 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>
= 49/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>

## Resulting Fraction and Simplification

The sum, 49/36, is an improper fraction because its numerator (49) is larger than its denominator (36) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

### [[Simplifying fractions | Simplifying Fractions]]

First, check if the fraction can be simplified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. The factors of 49 are 1, 7, and 49 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. 36 is not divisible by 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Therefore, 49/36 is already in its simplest form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

### Converting to a Mixed Number

To convert the improper fraction to a mixed number, divide the numerator by the denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>:

49 ÷ 36 = 1 with a remainder of 13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   The quotient (1) becomes the whole number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   The remainder (13) becomes the new numerator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   The denominator (36) remains the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

So, 49/36 equals 1 and 13/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

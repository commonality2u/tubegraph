The [[law_of_demand_in_microeconomics | Law of Demand]] is a fundamental concept in microeconomics, stating that if the price of a product is raised, the quantity demanded for that product will decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Conversely, if the price of a product is lowered, the quantity demanded will increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This principle generally holds true, though there are some exceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Demand vs. Quantity Demanded

It is crucial to understand the [[difference_between_quantity_demanded_and_demand | distinction between "demand" and "quantity demanded"]] in economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

*   **Quantity Demanded:** Refers to a specific amount of a product that consumers are willing to buy at a particular price point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. When the price of a product changes while all other factors remain constant (ceteris paribus), the quantity demanded changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This is represented as a movement *along* the demand curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
*   **Demand:** Represents the entire relationship between price and quantity demanded, assuming all other factors are equal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. This comprehensive relationship is shown by the entire demand schedule or the entire demand curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. If factors other than price change (e.g., consumer income, tastes, or the price of related goods), the entire demand relationship shifts, resulting in a new demand curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

## The Demand Schedule

A [[demand_schedule_and_its_significance | demand schedule]] is a table that illustrates the relationship between various prices and the corresponding quantities demanded for a product, assuming all other factors are held constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

### Example: "Space Whatever" Ebook

Consider the demand for a hypothetical science fiction ebook titled "Space Whatever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>:

| Scenario | Price ($) | Quantity Demanded (Units) |
| :------- | :-------- | :------------------------ |
| A        | 2         | 60,000                    |
| B        | 4         | 40,000                    |
| C        | 6         | 30,000                    |
| D        | 8         | 25,000                    |
| E        | 10        | 23,000                    |

This table directly demonstrates the [[law_of_demand_in_microeconomics | law of demand]]: as the price increases, the quantity demanded decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. This table itself represents the "demand" for the ebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

## Drawing the Demand Curve

A demand curve is a graphical representation of the demand schedule, showing the continuous relationship between price and quantity demanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

### Axis Conventions

In economics, a standard convention places:
*   **Price** on the **vertical (y) axis** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   **Quantity Demanded** on the **horizontal (x) axis** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

This convention is often debated as the independent variable (price, which is often changed) is typically placed on the horizontal axis in other scientific graphing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

### Plotting the Curve

To draw the demand curve, plot the points from the demand schedule and connect them:

1.  **Scenario A:** At a price of $2, the quantity demanded is 60,000 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
2.  **Scenario B:** At a price of $4, the quantity demanded is 40,000 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
3.  **Scenario C:** At a price of $6, the quantity demanded is 30,000 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
4.  **Scenario D:** At a price of $8, the quantity demanded is 25,000 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
5.  **Scenario E:** At a price of $10, the quantity demanded is 23,000 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

Connecting these points forms the demand curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. This curve typically slopes downwards from left to right, visually representing the inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded as described by the [[law_of_demand_in_microeconomics | law of demand]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

A movement *along* the demand curve signifies a change in [[difference_between_quantity_demanded_and_demand | quantity demanded]] due solely to a change in price, while all other factors remain constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. The entire curve itself represents "demand," and a shift of the curve would indicate a change in demand caused by [[factors_influencing_changes_in_demand_and_quantity_demanded | factors other than price]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

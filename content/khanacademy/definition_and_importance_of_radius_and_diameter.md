The circle is considered by many to be the most fundamental shape in our universe, appearing in phenomena from the orbits of planets to molecular structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Understanding the [[properties_of_a_circle | properties of the circle]] is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Defining the Circle

A circle is defined as all of the [[understanding_points_and_dimensions | points]] that are equidistant from a central point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Every [[understanding_points_and_dimensions | point]] along the edge of a circle is the same distance from its center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### The Radius

The consistent distance from the center of a circle to any [[understanding_points_and_dimensions | point]] on its edge is called the **radius** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. By definition, this distance never changes for a given circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. For example, if one radius measures 3 centimeters, all radii of that circle will be 3 centimeters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### The Diameter

The **diameter** is the distance across the circle at its widest point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This widest point must pass through the center of the circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The diameter can be seen as two radii extending in opposite directions from the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

### Relationship between Radius and Diameter

There is a simple [[relationship_between_diameter_and_radius | relationship between the diameter and the radius]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>:
*   The diameter is equal to two times the radius (D = 2r) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   Conversely, the radius is equal to half the diameter (r = D/2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

## Relationship with Circumference and Pi

The **circumference** of a circle is the distance around its edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. For thousands of years, people observed a consistent ratio between a circle's circumference and its diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### The Concept of Pi

Early measurements, though imprecise, suggested this ratio was roughly 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. With more accurate tools, they discovered the ratio was closer to 3.1, then 3.14159, with digits that continued indefinitely without repeating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. This constant ratio, fundamental to the universe because of the circle's prevalence, was given the name **[[the_mathematical_significance_of_pi | pi]]** (represented by the Greek letter π) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

[[the_mathematical_significance_of_pi | Pi]] first appears as the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>, but it is a fundamental number that appears widely in mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. It is important to remember that [[the_mathematical_significance_of_pi | pi]] is simply a number, approximately 3.14159... <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

### Formulas for Circumference

The relationship between [[understanding_circumference_and_its_calculation | circumference]], diameter, and radius is expressed by the following formulas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>:

*   The ratio of the circumference (C) to the diameter (D) is equal to [[the_mathematical_significance_of_pi | pi]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>:
    C / D = π

*   This can be rearranged to find the circumference:
    C = πD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>

*   Since D = 2r, the circumference can also be expressed in terms of the radius:
    C = π(2r) or C = 2πr <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>

## Practical Applications

These formulas allow for the calculation of one property of a circle if another is known.

### Example 1: Finding Circumference and Diameter from Radius

If a circle has a radius of 3 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>:
*   **Circumference**: Using C = 2πr <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>
    C = 2 * π * 3 meters = 6π meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
    Often, answers are left in terms of [[the_mathematical_significance_of_pi | pi]] for simplicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

*   **Diameter**: Using D = 2r <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>
    D = 2 * 3 meters = 6 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

### Example 2: Finding Diameter and Radius from Circumference

If a circle has a circumference of 10 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>:
*   **Diameter**: Using C = πD and rearranging for D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>
    πD = 10 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>
    D = 10 meters / π or 10/π meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

*   **Radius**: Using r = D/2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>
    r = (10/π meters) / 2 = 5/π meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

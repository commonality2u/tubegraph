A **radical** is another term for the square root symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. While often called the square root symbol, it can represent roots other than the square root <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Simplifying Radicals

[[simplifying_radicals | Simplifying radicals]] involves rewriting a radical expression so that the number under the radical sign is as small as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

### Core Concept: Connecting Radicals to Exponents

The square root of a number is equivalent to raising that number to the 1/2 power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. This connection demonstrates that [[simplifying_radicals | radical simplification]] is an extension of standard exponent rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

A fundamental exponent rule states that when multiplying two numbers and raising them to a power, you can raise each number to that power individually and then multiply the results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This means the square root of a product (e.g., `√(a × b)`) is equal to the product of the square roots (e.g., `√a × √b`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### The [[factorization_for_radical_simplification | Factorization Technique]]

To [[simplifying_radicals | simplify a radical]], the key is to find the largest factor of the number under the radical that is a perfect square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

**Steps for [[simplifying_radicals | radical simplification]]**:
1.  **Identify perfect square factors**: Look for factors of the number under the radical that are perfect squares (e.g., 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
2.  **Factor out the perfect square**: Rewrite the number under the radical as a product of its largest perfect square factor and another number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
3.  **Separate the radicals**: Apply the rule `√(a × b) = √a × √b` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
4.  **Simplify the perfect square radical**: Take the square root of the perfect square factor.
5.  **Multiply with any outside coefficients**: If there's a number already outside the radical, multiply it by the result from step 4.
6.  **Repeat if necessary**: For larger numbers, you might need to repeat the process if the remaining number under the radical still has a perfect square factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

**Example 1: Simplifying √72**
*   Recognize that 72 can be factored into `36 × 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   Rewrite: `√72 = √(36 × 2)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   Separate: `√36 × √2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   Simplify: `6 × √2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

**Example 2: Simplifying √50**
*   Recognize that 50 can be factored into `25 × 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. (25 is the largest perfect square factor of 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.)
*   Rewrite: `√50 = √(25 × 2)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   Separate: `√25 × √2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   Simplify: `5 × √2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

**Example 3: Simplifying 7√27**
*   Rewrite `27` as `9 × 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   `7√(9 × 3) = 7 × √9 × √3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   `= 7 × 3 × √3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   `= 21√3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

**Example 4: Simplifying 7√320 (Multi-step)**
*   Factor 320: `320 = 16 × 20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. (16 is a perfect square.)
*   `7√(16 × 20) = 7 × √16 × √20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
*   `= 7 × 4 × √20 = 28√20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   Now, factor 20: `20 = 4 × 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. (4 is a perfect square.)
*   `28√(4 × 5) = 28 × √4 × √5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
*   `= 28 × 2 × √5 = 56√5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
*   This process continues until the number under the radical cannot be divided by any perfect square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

### When a Radical Cannot Be Simplified

If the number under the radical sign is a prime number, or if its only factors are 1 and itself, and neither is a perfect square (other than 1), then the radical is already in its most simplified form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. For example, `3√29` cannot be simplified further because 29 is a prime number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

For millennia, humans have observed the diverse substances in their environment, noting their unique properties and how they interact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These substances can appear as solids, liquids, or gases, displaying distinct characteristics like color, light reflection, or reactivity at certain temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Examples include carbon (in its graphite form), lead, and gold, all of which are depicted in their solid state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Even air, composed of particles like carbon, oxygen, or nitrogen, possesses different properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Substances can also change states; gold or lead can become liquid when heated sufficiently, and carbon can turn into a gas if burned, breaking its structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Elements: Pure Substances

A fundamental question arises: if a substance like carbon is continuously broken down into smaller pieces, is there a smallest unit that still retains the properties of carbon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>? The answer is yes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. These pure substances with specific properties, reacting in certain ways at particular temperatures, are called **elements** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

Carbon, lead, and gold are all examples of elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Historically, water was considered an element, but it is now known to be composed of more basic elements: oxygen and hydrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. All known elements are organized and listed in the [[periodic_table_and_atomic_number | Periodic Table of Elements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. For instance, 'C' stands for carbon, 'O' for oxygen, 'N' for nitrogen, 'Si' for silicon, 'Au' for gold, and 'Pb' for lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This table plays a crucial [[role_of_periodic_table_in_chemistry | role in chemistry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Atoms: The Basic Unit of Elements

The most [[basic_building_blocks_of_matter | basic unit]] of any element is the **atom** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. If you were to continuously divide a substance like carbon or gold, you would eventually reach a single carbon atom or gold atom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Breaking an atom further would cause it to lose the characteristic properties of that element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

Atoms are incredibly, almost unimaginably, small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. For perspective, human hair, largely composed of carbon, is so thin that approximately one million carbon atoms could be strung across its width <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Scale of an Atom
> An average human hair is wide enough to fit approximately 1 million carbon atoms across its diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

## [[structure_and_components_of_atoms | Structure and Components of Atoms]]

While atoms are considered the basic building blocks of elements, they are themselves composed of even more fundamental particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. The arrangement and number of these fundamental particles define the element and its properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Changing the number of these particles can alter the element's properties or even transform it into a different element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

The three primary subatomic particles are:

*   **Protons**: These particles are located at the center of the atom, forming the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. The number of protons is the defining characteristic of an element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. This number is called the **atomic number** and is listed at the top of each element's entry in the [[periodic_table_and_atomic_number | Periodic Table]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. For example, hydrogen always has one proton, helium has two, and carbon always has six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. If an atom were to gain or lose a proton, it would become a different element (e.g., carbon with seven protons would become nitrogen) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Protons carry a positive electrical charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

*   **Neutrons**: Also found in the nucleus with protons, neutrons are electrically neutral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. While the number of protons defines the element, the number of neutrons can vary within atoms of the same element, leading to different versions called isotopes (e.g., carbon-12 has six neutrons, while carbon-14 has eight) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. The mass number (e.g., the '12' in carbon-12) represents the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

*   **Electrons**: These particles "buzz around" or "jump around" the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. While models sometimes depict them orbiting like planets, this is an oversimplification; their behavior is complex and described by quantum physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. Electrons have a negative electrical charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. Due to the electromagnetic force, unlike charges attract, meaning electrons are attracted to the positively charged protons in the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. Their high velocity prevents them from simply falling into the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

### Neutral Atoms and Ions

A neutral atom has an equal number of protons and electrons, leading to a balanced, overall zero charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. However, [[electrons_and_chemical_reactions | electrons]] can interact with other electrons or be transferred between atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. If an atom gains or loses electrons, it becomes an **ion**, carrying a net electrical charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. For example, if a carbon atom (with six protons and six electrons when neutral) loses an electron, it would have five electrons and six protons, resulting in a net positive charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.

Understanding the configuration and behavior of electrons is crucial for comprehending [[importance_of_chemistry_in_understanding_the_universe | chemistry]], as it helps predict how atoms of the same or different elements will react, bond, attract, or repel each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. This fundamental understanding of atoms and their constituents is a cornerstone of chemistry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

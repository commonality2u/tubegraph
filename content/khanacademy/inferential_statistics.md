[[introduction_to_statistics|Statistics]] broadly classifies into several categories, including [[descriptive_statistics|descriptive statistics]] and inferential statistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Inferential statistics involves using data to draw conclusions about various phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Core Concept
The main idea behind inferential statistics is to take sampled data from a larger population and, through mathematical analysis, make inferences or conclusions about that entire population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Sample vs. Population
A "sample" refers to a subset of data taken from a larger "population" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. For example, if three people are surveyed about their presidential vote, this group represents a sample, not the entire voting population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Inferential statistics aims to generalize findings from such samples to the broader population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

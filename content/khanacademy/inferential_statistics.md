[[introduction_to_statistics | Statistics]] broadly involves getting one's head around data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. It can be classified into several categories, including [[descriptive_statistics | descriptive statistics]] and [[inferential_statistics_and_probability_of_sample_means | inferential statistics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## What is Inferential Statistics?
[[inferential_statistics_and_probability_of_sample_means | Inferential statistics]] involves using data to draw conclusions about broader topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This often means sampling data from a larger population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### Samples vs. Populations
*   **Population** refers to the entire group one is interested in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   **Sample** is a subset of data collected from that population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. For example, surveying three people about their presidential vote does not cover the entire population, but rather a sample <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

The core idea of [[inferential_statistics_and_probability_of_sample_means | inferential statistics]] is to perform mathematical analysis on these samples to make inferences or conclusions about the population as a whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

From: [[khanacademy]] <br/> 

The "brute force method" for finding the [[least_common_multiple | least common multiple]] (LCM) involves listing out the multiples of each number until a common multiple is found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. The smallest number that appears in both lists is the [[least_common_multiple | least common multiple]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

## How to Use

To use this method, you simply list the multiples of each number in ascending order until you identify the first multiple common to all numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

### Example: LCM of 18 and 12

To find the [[least_common_multiple | LCM]] of 18 and 12 using the brute force method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>:

1.  List the multiples of 18:
    *   18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>
    *   36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>
    *   54 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>
    *   ... (and so on)

2.  List the multiples of 12:
    *   12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>
    *   24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>
    *   36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>
    *   ... (and so on)

3.  The smallest number that appears in both lists is 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Therefore, the [[least_common_multiple | LCM]] of 18 and 12 is 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

### Special Case: One Number is a Multiple of the Other

If one number is already a multiple of the other, the larger number is the [[least_common_multiple | LCM]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. For example, the [[least_common_multiple | LCM]] of 36 and 12 is 36, because 36 is a multiple of 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Limitations

While straightforward, this method can be less efficient when dealing with very large numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. For large numbers, listing all multiples can be time-consuming, as one might have to list many multiples before finding a common one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. In such cases, methods like the [[prime_factorization | prime factorization]] approach offer a more systematic and efficient solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

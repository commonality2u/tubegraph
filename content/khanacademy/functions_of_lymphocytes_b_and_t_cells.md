The immune system is broadly divided into two main categories: the [[innate_immune_system_and_its_components | nonspecific (innate) immune system]] and the specific (adaptive) immune system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. While the [[innate_immune_system_and_its_components | innate immune system]] provides general barriers and responses to anything that looks "shady" without specific identification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>, the specific immune system is an adaptive response that develops based on exposure to specific pathogens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.

The main actors in the specific immune system are [[cellular_structure_and_functions | lymphocytes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. [[cellular_structure_and_functions | Lymphocytes]] are a type of white blood cell, also known as leukocytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. While [[role_of_phagocytes_in_the_immune_response | phagocytes]] (such as [[role_of_mast_cells_and_dendritic_cells | dendritic cells]], macrophages, and neutrophils) are also white blood cells, they are primarily involved in the [[innate_immune_system_and_its_components | nonspecific immune system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

[[cellular_structure_and_functions | Lymphocytes]] can be categorized into two main types:
*   B [[cellular_structure_and_functions | lymphocytes]] (B cells) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>
*   T [[cellular_structure_and_functions | lymphocytes]] (T cells) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>

## B Lymphocytes (B Cells)

B [[cellular_structure_and_functions | lymphocytes]], commonly referred to as B cells, were initially identified in the bursa of Fabricius, a part of the immune system in birds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>. In humans, B cells are produced and developed in the bone marrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.

B [[cellular_structure_and_functions | lymphocytes]] are key participants in the [[humoral_vs_cellmediated_immune_response | humoral response]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>. The term "humoral" refers to the bodily fluids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>. The [[humoral_vs_cellmediated_immune_response | humoral response]] is effective against pathogens, such as viruses or bacteria, that are floating freely in the body's fluids and have not yet infiltrated [[cellular_structure_and_functions | cells]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>. Helper T cells can also play a role in activating and amplifying the [[humoral_vs_cellmediated_immune_response | humoral response]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>.

## T Lymphocytes (T Cells)

T [[cellular_structure_and_functions | lymphocytes]], or T cells, originate in the bone marrow but undergo maturation in the thymus, which is where the "T" in their name comes from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.

T [[cellular_structure_and_functions | lymphocytes]] participate in the [[humoral_vs_cellmediated_immune_response | cell-mediated immune response]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>. This response is crucial when pathogens, such as viruses or bacteria, have infiltrated and infected [[cellular_structure_and_functions | cells]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>. In such cases, the immune system aims to kill the infected [[cellular_structure_and_functions | cell]] itself to prevent further spread of the pathogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>.

There are different classes of T [[cellular_structure_and_functions | lymphocytes]], including:
*   Helper T cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>
*   Cytotoxic T cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>

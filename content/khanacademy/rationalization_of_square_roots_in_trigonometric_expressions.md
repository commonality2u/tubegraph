When working with [[introduction_to_basic_trigonometric_functions | trigonometric functions]], it is common to encounter expressions where a [[square_root_symbol_and_terminology | square root]] appears in the denominator. Rationalization is the process of rewriting such an expression so that the denominator contains only rational numbers, typically an integer [00:03:29]. This is often preferred because mathematicians "don't like to have an irrational number in the denominator" [00:03:29]. The irrational number isn't eliminated entirely; it is simply moved to the numerator [00:04:03].

## Method of Rationalization
To rationalize a denominator containing a [[square_root_symbol_and_terminology | square root]], both the numerator and the denominator are multiplied by the square root itself [00:03:39]. This process does not change the value of the number, as it is equivalent to multiplying by one (e.g., `sqrt(X) / sqrt(X)`) [00:03:45].

## Applying Rationalization in Trigonometric Calculations

### Example 1: Cosine of an Angle
Consider a right triangle with an angle `theta`, an adjacent side of 4, and a hypotenuse of `sqrt(65)` [00:03:21].
The cosine of `theta` is defined as adjacent over hypotenuse, so:
`cos(theta) = 4 / sqrt(65)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>

To rationalize this expression:
1.  Multiply the numerator and denominator by `sqrt(65)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>:
    `cos(theta) = (4 * sqrt(65)) / (sqrt(65) * sqrt(65))` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>
2.  Simplify the expression:
    `cos(theta) = (4 * sqrt(65)) / 65` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>

### Example 2: Sine of an Angle
Using the same triangle, if the side opposite angle `theta` is 7 and the hypotenuse is `sqrt(65)` [00:04:47], the sine of `theta` is defined as opposite over hypotenuse:
`sin(theta) = 7 / sqrt(65)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>

To rationalize this expression:
1.  Multiply the numerator and denominator by `sqrt(65)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>:
    `sin(theta) = (7 * sqrt(65)) / (sqrt(65) * sqrt(65))` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>
2.  Simplify the expression:
    `sin(theta) = (7 * sqrt(65)) / 65` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>

### Example 3: Tangent of 30 Degrees
Consider a 30-60-90 right triangle where the side opposite the 30-degree angle is 2, and the adjacent side is `2 * sqrt(3)` [00:09:38].
The tangent of 30 degrees is defined as opposite over adjacent:
`tan(30째) = 2 / (2 * sqrt(3))` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>

1.  First, [[simplifying_rational_expressions | simplify]] the expression by canceling out the common factor of 2 in the numerator and denominator [00:09:54]:
    `tan(30째) = 1 / sqrt(3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>
2.  To rationalize, multiply the numerator and denominator by `sqrt(3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>:
    `tan(30째) = (1 * sqrt(3)) / (sqrt(3) * sqrt(3))` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>
3.  Simplify the expression:
    `tan(30째) = sqrt(3) / 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>

## What is a Radical?

A radical is typically referred to as the square root symbol (√) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. For example, the square root of 36 is 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Connection to Exponents

The square root symbol is mathematically equivalent to raising a number to the 1/2 power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This means that simplifying radicals is an extension of [[understanding_exponents | exponent rules]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

For instance, the square root of 36 is the same as 36 raised to the 1/2 power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

A key [[understanding_exponents | exponent rule]] states that when you multiply two numbers and raise the product to a power (like 1/2), it's the same as raising each number to that power individually and then multiplying them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. This property is fundamental to [[simplifying_radicals | simplifying radicals]]:
√(a × b) = √a × √b <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## [[simplifying_radicals | Simplifying Radicals]]

To [[simplifying_radicals | simplify a radical]], the goal is to extract any perfect square factors from under the radical sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

### Steps and Examples:

1.  **Identify perfect square factors:** Look for the largest factor of the number under the radical that is a perfect square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Common perfect squares include 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, and so on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

    *   **Example 1: √72**
        *   72 can be factored as 36 × 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
        *   √72 = √(36 × 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>
        *   Using the exponent rule (or radical property): √36 × √2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>
        *   Since √36 = 6, the simplified form is 6√2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

    *   **Example 2: √50**
        *   50 can be factored as 25 × 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. (25 is the largest perfect square factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>).
        *   √50 = √(25 × 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>
        *   = √25 × √2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>
        *   = 5√2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
        *   Factoring into non-perfect squares like 5 and 10 would not simplify the radical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

    *   **Example 3: 7√27**
        *   27 can be factored as 9 × 3 (9 is a perfect square) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
        *   7√27 = 7√(9 × 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>
        *   = 7 × √9 × √3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>
        *   = 7 × 3 × √3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>
        *   = 21√3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

    *   **Example 4: 9√18**
        *   18 can be factored as 9 × 2 (9 is a perfect square) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
        *   9√18 = 9√(2 × 9) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>
        *   = 9 × √2 × √9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>
        *   = 9 × √2 × 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>
        *   = 27√2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

2.  **Radicals that are already perfect squares:**
    *   **Example: 4√25**
        *   25 is a perfect square (√25 = 5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
        *   4√25 = 4 × 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>
        *   = 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

3.  **Radicals that cannot be simplified:** If the number under the radical is prime or has no perfect square factors other than 1, it cannot be simplified further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
    *   **Example: 3√29**
        *   29 is a prime number, with factors only 1 and 29 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
        *   Neither 1 nor 29 are useful perfect squares for simplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
        *   Thus, 3√29 is already in its completely simplified form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

## [[factorization_techniques_for_radicals | Factorization Techniques for Radicals]] with Larger Numbers

For larger numbers, you can perform [[factorization_techniques_for_radicals | factorization]] in multiple steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

*   **Example: 7√320**
    *   Start by finding any perfect square factor. 16 goes into 320 (16 × 20) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
    *   7√320 = 7√(16 × 20) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>
    *   = 7 × √16 × √20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>
    *   = 7 × 4 × √20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>
    *   = 28√20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
    *   Now, look at √20. It can be further simplified because 20 is 4 × 5 (4 is a perfect square) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
    *   28√20 = 28√(4 × 5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>
    *   = 28 × √4 × √5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>
    *   = 28 × 2 × √5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>
    *   = 56√5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.
    *   This iterative process continues until the number under the radical cannot be reduced anymore by a perfect square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

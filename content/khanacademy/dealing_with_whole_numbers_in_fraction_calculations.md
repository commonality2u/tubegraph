When performing [[fraction_calculation_methods | fraction calculations]] that involve whole numbers, it's possible to express the whole number as a fraction to simplify the operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

## Converting a Whole Number to a Fraction

A whole number can always be written as a fraction by placing it over a denominator of 1 (e.g., 5 = 5/1). To add or subtract it from another fraction, convert the whole number into an [[Finding a common denominator for fractions | equivalent fraction]] with the same denominator as the other fraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

### Example: Subtracting a Whole Number

Consider the problem `1/10 - 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

1.  **Express the whole number as a fraction with the required denominator:** The whole number `1` needs to be rewritten as a fraction with a denominator of `10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Since `1` is equivalent to `10/10`, the problem becomes `1/10 - 10/10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
2.  **Perform the subtraction:** Now that the fractions have the same denominator, subtract the numerators and keep the common denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
    `1 - 10 = -9` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>
    The denominator remains `10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
3.  **Result:** `1/10 - 1 = -9/10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

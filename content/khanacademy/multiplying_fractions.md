Multiplying fractions is a straightforward process where the new numerator is the product of the original numerators, and the new denominator is the product of the original denominators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## How to Multiply Fractions

To multiply fractions, you simply multiply the top numbers (numerators) together and the bottom numbers (denominators) together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

For example, to multiply 5/6 by 2/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>:

1.  Multiply the numerators: 5 * 2 = 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
2.  Multiply the denominators: 6 * 3 = 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

This results in 10/18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This can be viewed as finding 2/3 of 5/6, or 5/6 of 2/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## [[simplifying_fractions | Simplifying Fractions]] After Multiplication

After multiplying, the resulting fraction should often be [[simplifying_fractions | simplified to its lowest terms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. To do this, find a common factor for both the numerator and the denominator and divide both by that factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

Using our example of 10/18:

*   Both 10 and 18 are divisible by 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   Divide 10 by 2 to get 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   Divide 18 by 2 to get 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

The [[simplifying_fractions | simplified]] answer is 5/9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## [[simplifying_fractions | Simplifying Fractions]] Before Multiplication

An alternative method is to [[simplifying_fractions | simplify]] the fractions *before* performing the multiplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This can sometimes make the multiplication easier.

Consider the example 5/6 * 2/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>:

1.  Look for common factors between any numerator and any denominator.
2.  Notice that the numerator 2 (from 2/3) and the denominator 6 (from 5/6) are both divisible by 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
3.  Divide the numerator 2 by 2, which leaves 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
4.  Divide the denominator 6 by 2, which leaves 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
5.  Now the multiplication becomes 5/3 * 1/3.
6.  Multiply the new numerators: 5 * 1 = 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
7.  Multiply the new denominators: 3 * 3 = 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

This also results in 5/9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Both methods are valid, but [[simplifying_fractions | simplifying]] earlier can sometimes make it easier to identify common factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

Multiplying fractions is a straightforward process. To find the product of two fractions, you multiply their numerators together and their denominators together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## How to Multiply Fractions

The process involves two main steps:
1.  Multiply the [[numerator_and_denominator_in_fraction_multiplication | numerators]] (top numbers) to get the new numerator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
2.  Multiply the [[numerator_and_denominator_in_fraction_multiplication | denominators]] (bottom numbers) to get the new denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

### Example: 5/6 times 2/3

Let's multiply 5/6 by 2/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>:

*   **Multiply the numerators**: 5 times 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   **Multiply the denominators**: 6 times 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

This results in:
```
(5 × 2) / (6 × 3) = 10 / 18
```
So, 5/6 times 2/3 equals 10/18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This can be conceptualized as finding 2/3 *of* 5/6, or 5/6 *of* 2/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Simplifying the Product

After multiplying fractions, it is often necessary to [[simplifying_fractions | simplify the answer]] to its lowest terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This means dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common factor until they share no common factors other than 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Simplifying After Multiplication

Using the example of 10/18:
Both 10 and 18 are divisible by 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   Divide 10 by 2: 10 ÷ 2 = 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   Divide 18 by 2: 18 ÷ 2 = 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

So, 10/18 simplifies to 5/9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

### Simplifying Before Multiplication

It is also possible to [[methods_for_simplifying_fractions | simplify fractions]] *before* performing the multiplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This can make the numbers smaller and easier to work with.

Consider 5/6 times 2/3 again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>:
*   Notice that there is a 2 in the numerator of the second fraction (2/3) and a 6 in the denominator of the first fraction (5/6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   Both 2 and 6 are divisible by 2.
    *   Divide the numerator 2 by 2, which becomes 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
    *   Divide the denominator 6 by 2, which becomes 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

The expression now becomes:
```
5/3 × 1/3
```
Now, multiply the modified fractions:
*   5 times 1 = 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   3 times 3 = 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

The result is 5/9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, the same answer obtained by simplifying after multiplication. Simplifying beforehand can sometimes make it easier to identify common factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

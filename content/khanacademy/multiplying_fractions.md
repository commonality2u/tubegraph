Multiplying fractions is a straightforward process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. To find the product of two fractions, you multiply their numerators together to get the new numerator, and multiply their denominators together to get the new denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Example: 5/6 times 2/3

To multiply 5/6 by 2/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>:

1.  **Multiply the numerators**: 5 times 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
2.  **Multiply the denominators**: 6 times 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

This results in:
$$\frac{5 \times 2}{6 \times 3} = \frac{10}{18}$$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>

The result, 10/18, can be viewed as either 2/3 of 5/6 or 5/6 of 2/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Simplifying the Product

The product 10/18 is a correct answer, but it can be [[simplifying_fractions|simplified]] to its lowest terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Both 10 and 18 share common factors, specifically they are both divisible by 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

To [[simplifying_fractions|simplify]] 10/18:
1.  Divide the numerator (10) by 2: 10 รท 2 = 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
2.  Divide the denominator (18) by 2: 18 รท 2 = 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

The [[simplifying_fractions|simplified]] answer is 5/9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Simplifying Before Multiplication

It is also possible to [[simplifying_fractions|simplify]] fractions before performing the multiplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This can make the numbers smaller and easier to work with.

For the example 5/6 times 2/3:
*   Notice that the numerator of the second fraction is 2, and the denominator of the first fraction is 6. Both are divisible by 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   Divide the 2 in the numerator by 2, which makes it 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   Divide the 6 in the denominator by 2, which makes it 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

The expression now becomes:
$$\frac{5}{3} \times \frac{1}{3}$$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>

Now, multiply the new numerators and denominators:
$$\frac{5 \times 1}{3 \times 3} = \frac{5}{9}$$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>

This method yields the same [[simplifying_fractions|simplified]] answer but performs the [[simplifying_fractions|simplification]] steps earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. While both methods work, [[simplifying_fractions|simplifying]] before multiplication can sometimes make it easier to identify common factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

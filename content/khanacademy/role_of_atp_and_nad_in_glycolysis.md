From: [[khanacademy]] <br/> 

[[overview_of_glycolysis | Glycolysis]], the first phase of cellular respiration, literally means the breaking down of [[role_of_glucose_in_energy_production | glucose]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. This process involves the crucial roles of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) and Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD) in energy transfer and production.

## Role of ATP
ATP plays a dual role in [[glycolysis process and its role in breaking down glucose | glycolysis]], being both consumed and produced during the [[glycolysis process and phases | process]].

### Investment Phase
The initial stages of [[steps and reactions in glycolysis | glycolysis]] require an energy investment in the form of ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.
*   [[glycolysis process and phases | This phase]], sometimes called the "investment phase," uses two ATP molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.
*   The purpose of consuming these ATPs is to break up the glucose molecule into two 3-carbon compounds, which also gain phosphate groups from the ATPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. These compounds are referred to as PGAL (phosphoglyceraldehyde) or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>.

### Payoff Phase
Following the investment, the [[steps and reactions in glycolysis | subsequent phases]] of [[glycolysis process and its role in breaking down glucose | glycolysis]] generate ATP.
*   Each of the two PGAL molecules proceeds into the "payoff phase" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>, where they are converted into pyruvate (also called pyruvic acid) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.
*   During this conversion, each PGAL molecule produces two ATPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>.
*   Since there are two PGAL molecules, a total of four ATPs are produced in the payoff phase for every molecule of glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a>.

### Net ATP Yield
Considering both phases, the [[net energy yield in glycolysis | net ATP production]] in [[glycolysis process and its role in breaking down glucose | glycolysis]] is two ATP molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a>.
*   Four ATPs are produced in the payoff phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a>.
*   Two ATPs are consumed in the investment phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a>.

## Role of NAD (and NADH)
NAD (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide) plays a critical [[role_of_nad_in_glycolysis | role]] as an electron carrier in [[glycolysis process and its role in breaking down glucose | glycolysis]].
*   During the conversion of PGAL to pyruvate in the payoff phase, NAD+ acts as a raw material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.
*   For each PGAL molecule, NAD+ is reduced by gaining a hydrogen, forming NADH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:00]</a>.
*   Since two PGAL molecules are processed, a total of two NADH molecules are produced for every glucose molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:00">[12:18:00]</a>.
*   These NADH molecules are vital because they will later be used in the electron transport chain (the final phase of cellular respiration) to produce a significant amount of ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">[12:22:00]</a>. Each NADH can produce approximately three ATPs in the electron transport chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>.

*   **Inputs (Raw Materials)**: Glucose, two NAD+ molecules, four ADP molecules, and two phosphate groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>.
*   **Outputs**: Two pyruvate molecules, two NADH molecules, and a [[net energy yield in glycolysis | net production]] of two ATP molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>.

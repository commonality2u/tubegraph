[[DNA and cell function | DNA]] serves as the molecular basis of heredity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. To fulfill this role, the genetic information stored in [[DNA and cell function | DNA]] must be expressed to define an organism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. This is where [[RNA]] plays a crucial role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>.

## What is RNA?

[[RNA]] stands for ribonucleic acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>. It is a molecule related to [[DNA and cell function | DNA]], which is deoxyribonucleic acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:02">[07:02:02]</a>. The primary difference lies in their sugar backbones, as [[RNA]] contains ribose sugar while [[DNA and cell function | DNA]] contains deoxyribose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. Another key distinction in their base pairs is that [[RNA]] uses uracil (U) instead of thymine (T) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>.

## RNA's Role in Gene Expression

For [[gene expression and transcription | gene expression]] to occur, the information stored in [[DNA and cell function | DNA]], which typically resides in the nucleus of cells, needs to be communicated outside the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:01">[07:41:01]</a>. [[RNA]] acts as a [[messenger_rna_and_transcription_process | messenger RNA]] (mRNA) to carry this genetic information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>.

### Transcription: From DNA to mRNA

The process of going from [[DNA and cell function | DNA]] to [[messenger_rna_and_transcription_process | messenger RNA]] is called [[gene_expression_and_transcription | transcription]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>. Conceptually, it is similar to [[DNA and cell function | DNA]] replication, where one strand of the [[DNA and cell function | DNA]] molecule is used as a template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>.

During [[gene_expression_and_transcription | transcription]]:
*   Adenine (A) on the [[DNA and cell function | DNA]] template pairs with Uracil (U) in the newly forming [[RNA]] strand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>.
*   Thymine (T) on the [[DNA and cell function | DNA]] template pairs with Adenine (A) in the [[RNA]] strand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>.
*   Guanine (G) on the [[DNA and cell function | DNA]] template pairs with Cytosine (C) in the [[RNA]] strand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>.
*   Cytosine (C) on the [[DNA and cell function | DNA]] template pairs with Guanine (G) in the [[RNA]] strand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>.

This process results in a single strand of [[messenger_rna_and_transcription_process | messenger RNA]] (mRNA) that carries the information from a specific section, or gene, of the [[DNA and cell function | DNA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>. This [[messenger_rna_and_transcription_process | mRNA]] can then leave the nucleus and attach to a ribosome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>.

### Translation: From mRNA to Protein

The next step in [[gene expression and transcription | gene expression]] is [[translation_and_protein_synthesis | translation]], which is the process of converting the [[messenger_rna_and_transcription_process | mRNA]] base pair sequence into an amino acid sequence, ultimately forming a protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>. Proteins are made up of sequences of amino acids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>.

Key aspects of [[translation_and_protein_synthesis | translation]]:
*   **Codons**: Each sequence of three bases on the [[messenger_rna_and_transcription_process | mRNA]] is called a codon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>. Each codon codes for a specific amino acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>.
*   There are 64 possible codons (4 bases x 4 bases x 4 bases) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:00">[12:35:00]</a>. This is more than enough to code for the 20 possible amino acids, allowing for redundancy (more than one codon can code for the same amino acid) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>.
*   **tRNA**: Another type of [[RNA]], called transfer [[RNA]] (tRNA), is responsible for bringing the correct amino acid to the ribosome based on the codon sequence on the [[messenger_rna_and_transcription_process | mRNA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>. The tRNA has an anticodon that matches the [[messenger_rna_and_transcription_process | mRNA]] codon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:00">[13:51:00]</a>.

As amino acids are brought and linked together in sequence, a [[protein_synthesis_and_ribosomes | protein]] is constructed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:29:00">[14:29:00]</a>. Proteins are essential molecules that "run life," serving functions as enzymes, structural components (like muscle), and more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:42:00">[14:42:00]</a>. They can be thousands or more amino acids long, forming complex shapes with diverse functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:03:00">[15:03:00]</a>.

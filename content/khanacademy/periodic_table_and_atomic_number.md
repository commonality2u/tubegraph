For millennia, humans have observed that different substances in their environment possess distinct properties and react differently under various circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These properties can include light reflection, color, temperature, and state (liquid, gas, or solid) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Examples of these substances include carbon (in graphite form), lead, and gold, often found in solid states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. Air particles like carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen also exhibit unique properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. Substances can also change states; for instance, gold or lead can become liquid at high temperatures, and carbon can turn gaseous when burned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.

## Elements: The Fundamental Substances

A fundamental question arises: if you continuously break down a substance into smaller pieces, is there a smallest unit that still retains the original substance's properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>? The answer is yes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

These pure substances with specific properties at certain temperatures and reactive behaviors are called [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | elements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. Carbon, lead, and gold are examples of [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | elements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. Historically, water was considered an element, but it is now known to be composed of more basic [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | elements]]: oxygen and hydrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

All known [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | elements]] are systematically listed in the [[role_of_periodic_table_in_chemistry | Periodic Table of Elements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.

## Atoms: The Smallest Units of Elements

The most basic unit of any [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | element]] is the [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | atom]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>. For example, if you keep dividing carbon, you eventually reach a carbon [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | atom]], which cannot be further broken down while retaining the properties of carbon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | Atoms]] are unimaginably small; for instance, the width of an average human hair is approximately 1 million carbon [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | atoms]] wide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.

## Atomic Structure and the Atomic Number

[[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | Atoms]], while the most basic [[basic_building_blocks_of_matter | building block]] of an [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | element]], are themselves composed of even more fundamental particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>. These fundamental particles include:
*   **Protons**: Positively charged particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>.
*   **Neutrons**: Electrically neutral particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>.
*   **Electrons**: Negatively charged particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>.

### The Role of Protons and Atomic Number

The most crucial of these for defining an [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | element]] is the **proton** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>. The number of protons in an [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | atom]]'s nucleus (its center) is what uniquely identifies an [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | element]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>. This number is known as the **atomic number** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.

For example:
*   Hydrogen (H) has 1 proton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>.
*   Helium (He) has 2 protons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.
*   Carbon (C) has 6 protons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.
*   Oxygen (O) has 8 protons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>.

If the number of protons changes, the [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | element]] itself changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>. For example, if carbon were to gain a seventh proton, it would no longer be carbon; it would become nitrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.

### The Periodic Table's Arrangement

The [[role_of_periodic_table_in_chemistry | Periodic Table of Elements]] is organized by increasing atomic number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>. The atomic number is typically displayed at the top of each [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | element]]'s entry on the periodic table, highlighting its fundamental importance in defining the [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | element]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>.

### Other Subatomic Particles

While protons define the [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | element]], the number of neutrons and [[electrons_and_chemical_reactions | electrons]] can vary without changing the [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | element]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>.

*   **Neutrons**: Protons and neutrons form the atom's nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>. The sum of protons and neutrons in the nucleus defines the atomic mass number (e.g., Carbon-12 has 6 protons and 6 neutrons, totaling 12) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>. Different versions of the same [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | element]] with varying numbers of neutrons are called isotopes (e.g., Carbon-12 vs. Carbon-14, which has 8 neutrons) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>.
*   **Electrons**: [[electrons_and_chemical_reactions | Electrons]] are thought to move around or "buzz" around the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>. Unlike charges attract, so the negatively charged [[electrons_and_chemical_reactions | electrons]] are attracted to the positively charged protons in the nucleus, keeping them bound to the [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | atom]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:00">[10:08:00]</a>.
    *   In a neutral [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | atom]], the number of [[electrons_and_chemical_reactions | electrons]] equals the number of protons, canceling out the charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>.
    *   However, [[electrons_and_chemical_reactions | electrons]] can be gained or lost by [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | atoms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:12:00]</a>. If an [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | atom]] loses an [[electrons_and_chemical_reactions | electron]], it will have a net positive charge (e.g., a carbon [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | atom]] with 6 protons and 5 [[electrons_and_chemical_reactions | electrons]] would be positively charged) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a>. These interactions and configurations of [[electrons_and_chemical_reactions | electrons]] are fundamental to understanding [[introduction_to_chemical_equations | chemical reactions]] and the properties of [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | elements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:19:00">[11:19:00]</a>.

Understanding the [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | atom]] as the [[basic_building_blocks_of_matter | fundamental building block]] of an [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | element]], and how it is composed of protons, neutrons, and [[electrons_and_chemical_reactions | electrons]], allows for predictions of how [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | atoms]] will interact and bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>. The number of protons specifically defines the [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | element]] and its position on the [[role_of_periodic_table_in_chemistry | Periodic Table of Elements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.

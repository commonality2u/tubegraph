When learning to [[solving_equations_with_variables | solve equations with variables]], it's important to understand what the equations mean and how to manipulate them systematically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. While simple linear equations can sometimes be solved mentally, a systematic approach is crucial as equations become more complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Understanding Notation

A statement like `7x = 14` literally means "7 times x is equal to 14" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. In algebra, the multiplication sign (×) is often omitted as a shorthand notation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. When a number is written next to a variable (e.g., `7x`), it indicates multiplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

The traditional multiplication sign is generally avoided, especially when 'x' is the variable, to prevent confusion (e.g., `7xx` instead of `7 * x`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Sometimes, a dot (`·`) might be used to represent multiplication (e.g., `7·x`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, but simply writing `7x` is common practice when multiplying a number by a variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## The Principle of Maintaining Equality

An equation states that one side is equal to the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. To maintain this equality, any operation performed on one side of the equation must also be performed on the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

## Example 1: Solving `7x = 14`

Consider the equation `7x = 14` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### Mental Approach (for simple cases)
You might solve this mentally by recalling your 7 times table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   7 × 1 = 7 (not 14) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>
*   7 × 2 = 14 (this works) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>
So, `x` would be 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### Systematic Approach
To solve this systematically, recognize that `7x` means `x` added to itself 7 times (x + x + x + x + x + x + x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. The equation `7x = 14` states that seven 'x's are equal to 14 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

To isolate 'x', divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient (the number multiplying the variable), which is 7 in this case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>:

`7x = 14` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>

Divide both sides by 7:
`(7x) / 7 = 14 / 7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>

The 7s on the left cancel out, leaving 'x' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
`x = 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>

### Visualizing Division
Imagine `7x` as seven separate 'x' units and 14 as 14 individual objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. When you divide both sides by 7, you are essentially breaking both the collection of `x`'s and the collection of objects into seven equal groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. If the total amounts were equal, then each of the seven groups must also be equal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. This visualization shows that each 'x' corresponds to two of the objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

## Example 2: Solving `3x = 15`

Let's solve `3x = 15` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
To get 'x' by itself on the left side, you need to divide by 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

`3x = 15` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>
Divide both sides by 3:
`(3x) / 3 = 15 / 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>
`x = 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>

### Alternative: Multiplying by the Reciprocal
Dividing both sides by 3 is equivalent to multiplying both sides by 1/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
`3x = 15` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>
Multiply both sides by 1/3:
`(1/3) * 3x = (1/3) * 15` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>
`1x = 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>
`x = 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>

## Example 3: Solving `2y + 4y = 18`

Consider a slightly more complex equation: `2y + 4y = 18` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

### Combining Like Terms
First, simplify the left side of the equation by combining "like terms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. If you have two 'y's and add four more 'y's, you will have six 'y's total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
`2y + 4y = 6y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>

So the equation simplifies to:
`6y = 18` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>

### Solving the Simplified Equation
Now, solve `6y = 18` using the systematic approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.
Divide both sides by 6:
`(6y) / 6 = 18 / 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>
`y = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>

### Checking the Solution
It's always a good practice to check your answer by substituting the solution back into the original equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>:
Original equation: `2y + 4y = 18` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>
Substitute `y = 3`:
`2 * 3 + 4 * 3 = 18` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>
`6 + 12 = 18` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>
`18 = 18` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>
Since both sides are equal, the solution `y = 3` is correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

[[linear_equations | Linear equations]] are a fundamental concept in algebra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Solving them involves finding the value of an unknown variable that makes the equation true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This article focuses on [[solving_algebraic_equations | solving algebraic equations]] where a number is multiplied by a variable.

## Understanding the Notation

When a number is written directly next to a variable, it implies multiplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. For example, `5x` means "5 times x" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This notation is used in algebra to avoid confusion with the variable `x` if a traditional multiplication sign (x) were used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. A dot (`â‹…`) can also be used to denote multiplication between constants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

## Systematic Approach to Solving

While some simple equations can be solved mentally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, a systematic approach is necessary for more complex problems. The goal is to isolate the variable on one side of the equation.

### Method 1: Division

For an equation like `5x = 20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, you can divide both sides of the equation by the *coefficient* of `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The coefficient is the number being multiplied by the variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

In this example:
`5x = 20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>
Divide both sides by 5:
`5x / 5 = 20 / 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>
The 5s on the left cancel out:
`x = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>

### Method 2: Multiplying by the Reciprocal

An equivalent approach, often more useful when dealing with fractions, is to multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of the coefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Multiplying by a reciprocal is the same as dividing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

For `5x = 20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, the reciprocal of 5 is 1/5.
Multiply both sides by 1/5:
` (1/5) * 5x = (1/5) * 20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>
`x = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>

## Examples with Fractions and Negative Numbers

### Example 1

Consider the equation: `(-3/4)x = 10/13` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
1.  Identify the coefficient of `x`, which is -3/4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
2.  Find the reciprocal of -3/4, which is -4/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
3.  Multiply both sides of the equation by -4/3:
    `(-4/3) * (-3/4)x = (-4/3) * (10/13)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>
4.  On the left side, -4/3 and -3/4 cancel out to 1, leaving `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
5.  On the right side, multiply the numerators and denominators:
    `x = (10 * -4) / (13 * 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>
    `x = -40 / 39` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>

### Example 2

Consider the equation: `(-5/6)x = 7/8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
1.  The coefficient of `x` is -5/6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
2.  The reciprocal of -5/6 is -6/5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
3.  Multiply both sides by -6/5:
    `(-6/5) * (-5/6)x = (-6/5) * (7/8)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>
4.  The left side simplifies to `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
5.  For the right side, simplify before multiplying:
    The 6 and 8 can both be divided by 2 (6 becomes 3, 8 becomes 4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
    `x = (7 * -3) / (5 * 4)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>
    `x = -21/20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>

## Checking Your Answer

A valuable aspect of algebra is the ability to verify your solution by substituting the obtained value of the variable back into the original equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. If both sides of the equation are equal, your answer is correct.

**Example: Checking Example 1**
Original equation: `(-3/4)x = 10/13` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>
Our solution: `x = -40/39` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>
Substitute `x` back into the equation:
`(-3/4) * (-40/39)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>
Simplify by cross-cancellation:
*   4 divides into 40 (becomes 10) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   3 divides into 39 (becomes 13) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   A negative times a negative is a positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
This results in `(1 * 10) / (1 * 13) = 10/13` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>, which matches the right side of the original equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

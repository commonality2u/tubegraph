## The Stagnation of Space Exploration

[[Inspiration from historical figures | Elon Musk]] conceived of [[the_business_and_challenges_of_entrepreneurship | his ventures]] by considering areas that would most affect the future of humanity: the internet, sustainable energy, and space exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:02">[04:40:02]</a>. He believes there's a substantial bifurcation in humanity's future: either becoming a multi-planet species or remaining confined to Earth until an eventual extinction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:09">[04:49:09]</a>. Historically, people in 1969 expected a moon base, human missions to Mars, or even a Mars base and orbiting space hotels by 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. However, in 2013, the United States was unable to send anyone to orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.

In 2001, after [[the_rise_of_paypal_and_its_growth_strategies | PayPal]], Elon Musk investigated why humans hadn't been sent to Mars following the Apollo missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. His initial search on the NASA website for plans to send people to Mars yielded no results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. He discovered that NASA had no current plans for human missions to Mars or even back to the Moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.

Musk initially thought the problem was a lack of national will to pursue space exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. He considered trying to excite people about space and secure a larger budget for NASA to go to Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.

## SpaceX's Genesis and Mission

Elon Musk's idea for Mars Oasis involved sending a small greenhouse with seeds in dehydrated gel to Mars, which would be hydrated upon landing to create green plants on a red background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. This project aimed to achieve the "first life on Mars" and the "furthest life's ever traveled," which he believed would excite the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. He was willing to spend half the money he earned from [[the_rise_of_paypal_and_its_growth_strategies | PayPal]] on this venture with no expectation of return, viewing it as important to spur a return to Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>.

Musk's friends tried to dissuade him from starting a rocket company, deeming it "crazy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>, and one friend even showed him videos of rockets blowing up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. However, his expectation was already to potentially lose the money, so their concerns did not deter him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.

### The Quest for Affordability

Musk compressed the costs of the spacecraft and mission to a manageable number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>. He found US rockets too expensive, leading him to travel to Russia three times in 2001 and 2002 to negotiate the purchase of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. He aimed to buy two of the largest ICBMs in the Russian fleet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.

*   **Cost Comparison:** A Boeing Delta II rocket would cost $65 million each, totaling $130 million for two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>. In contrast, an ICBM in 2001 would cost about $10 million each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>. He calculated that two ICBMs and the rest of the mission for two identical launches could be done for roughly $40 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>.

After his third trip to Russia, he realized that the issue wasn't a lack of will for space exploration in the United States, but rather the perceived cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. Americans were unwilling to sacrifice healthcare for Mars missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>, but a cost representing a quarter or half percent of GDP would be palatable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>. This led him to focus on finding "a way" to make space travel affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>.

### Founding SpaceX

Musk determined that while historically all rockets were expensive, it didn't mean they always had to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. He broke down the raw material costs of a rocket (aluminum, titanium, copper, carbon fiber) and found they accounted for only about 2% of the total cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>. The bulk of the cost came from "how the atoms are arranged" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>, leading him to focus on efficiency in manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>. After consulting with aerospace professionals and finding no fundamental "catch," he started SpaceX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>.

SpaceX's first rocket, the Falcon 1, cost about $6 million, compared to other rockets in its class at $25 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>. The Falcon 9 rocket costs about $60 million to build from new, roughly a quarter of the price of rockets from Boeing or Lockheed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a>.

### Reusability and Future Vision

The most significant cost reduction comes from making rockets reusable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>. This could make launch costs two orders of magnitude cheaper, or 1/100th of the current price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>. The goal is for rockets to return and land at the launch site, then reload propellant and take off again, similar to an airplane's reusability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>. Musk is hopeful for this to happen as early as next year (from the time of recording) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>.

Despite three initial failed launches of the Falcon 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a> and no successful recovery of rocket stages yet (as of 2013) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>, Musk believes they have identified the reasons for re-entry failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>. The challenge is achieving sufficient mass efficiency to allow for payload to orbit while also reserving propellant for reusability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>. The propellant cost for a Falcon 9 is only about $200,000, which is comparable to refueling a 747 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:57">[00:27:57]</a>.

SpaceX's immediate goal is to earn enough money by launching commercial, mapping, government, and GPS satellites, and by servicing the International Space Station, to sustain the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>. This revenue helps them continue improving technology to achieve full reusability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>. Ultimately, the aim is to develop the scale and sophistication required to take people to Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>.

Musk estimates that humans will likely be on Mars in about 12 years (from the time of recording), ideally on a round trip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>.# Space Exploration and SpaceX's Mission

## The Stagnation of Space Exploration

[[Elon Musk's donation to Khan Academy | Elon Musk]] defines his [[the_business_and_challenges_of_entrepreneurship | ventures]] by identifying areas that significantly impact the future of humanity: the internet, sustainable energy, and space exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:02">[04:40:02]</a>. He sees a critical fork in humanity's path: either becoming a multi-planet species or facing inevitable extinction by remaining confined to Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:09">[04:49:09]</a>. Historically, people in 1969 anticipated a lunar base, human missions to Mars, or even a Mars base and orbiting space hotels by 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. Yet, by 2013, the United States was unable to send anyone to orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.

In 2001, after [[the_rise_of_paypal_and_its_growth_strategies | PayPal]], [[Elon Musk's donation to Khan Academy | Musk]] sought to understand why human missions to Mars hadn't occurred after the Apollo program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. His search on NASA's website for Mars mission plans yielded no results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. He eventually learned that NASA had no immediate plans for human missions to Mars or even a return to the Moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.

Initially, [[Elon Musk's donation to Khan Academy | Musk]] believed the lack of progress stemmed from insufficient national will for space exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. He considered inspiring public excitement to secure a larger budget for NASA to facilitate a Mars mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.

## SpaceX's Genesis and Mission

[[Elon Musk's donation to Khan Academy | Musk]] envisioned a Mars Oasis project, involving a small greenhouse with dehydrated seeds that would be hydrated upon landing to grow green plants on Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. He aimed for this to be the "first life on Mars" and the "furthest life's ever traveled," believing it would greatly excite the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. He was prepared to invest half of his earnings from [[the_rise_of_paypal_and_its_growth_strategies | PayPal]] into this venture without expecting a financial return, considering it crucial for reigniting Mars exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>.

Friends attempted to dissuade [[Elon Musk's donation to Khan Academy | Musk]] from founding a rocket company, deeming it "crazy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>, with one even showing him videos of rocket explosions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. However, since he already anticipated potentially losing the investment, their concerns did not deter him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.

### The Quest for Affordability

[[Elon Musk's donation to Khan Academy | Musk]] managed to reduce the projected costs for his spacecraft and mission to a manageable figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>. Finding U.S. rockets prohibitively expensive, he traveled to Russia three times in 2001 and 2002 to negotiate the purchase of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. He sought to acquire two of the largest ICBMs in the Russian arsenal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.

*   **Cost Comparison:** A Boeing Delta II rocket would cost $65 million each, totaling $130 million for two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>. In contrast, an ICBM in 2001 cost approximately $10 million each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>. [[Elon Musk's donation to Khan Academy | Musk]] calculated that two ICBMs and the remaining mission costs for two identical launches could be achieved for roughly $40 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>.

Following his third trip to Russia, [[Elon Musk's donation to Khan Academy | Musk]] realized that the primary obstacle to space exploration was not a lack of national will, but rather the perceived exorbitant cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. Americans were unwilling to sacrifice essential services like healthcare for Mars missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>, but a cost equivalent to a quarter or half percent of GDP would be acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>. This insight led him to focus on making space travel affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>.

### Founding SpaceX

[[Elon Musk's donation to Khan Academy | Musk]] concluded that although rockets had historically been expensive, this did not predestine their future cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. By breaking down a rocket's raw material costs (aluminum, titanium, copper, carbon fiber), he found they comprised only about 2% of the total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>. The majority of the cost, therefore, lay in "how the atoms are arranged" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>, prompting him to prioritize manufacturing efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>. After consulting with aerospace experts and finding no fundamental challenges, he founded SpaceX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>.

SpaceX's first rocket, the Falcon 1, cost approximately $6 million to build, significantly less than other rockets in its class, which cost around $25 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>. The Falcon 9 rocket costs about $60 million new, roughly a quarter of the price of rockets from traditional manufacturers like Boeing or Lockheed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a>.

### Reusability and Future Vision

The most substantial cost reduction will come from making rockets reusable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>. This innovation could decrease launch costs by two orders of magnitude, or to 1/100th of the current price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>. The objective is for rockets to return and land at their launch site, refuel, and take off again, mirroring the reusability of airplanes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>. [[Elon Musk's donation to Khan Academy | Musk]] hoped to achieve this as early as the year following the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>.

Despite three initial failed launches of the Falcon 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a> and no successful recovery of rocket stages by 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>, [[Elon Musk's donation to Khan Academy | Musk]] believes they have identified the causes of re-entry failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>. The core challenge lies in achieving sufficient mass efficiency to carry payloads to orbit while still reserving propellant for reusability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>. The propellant cost for a Falcon 9 is only about $200,000, comparable to refueling a 747 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:57">[00:27:57]</a>.

SpaceX's immediate goal is to generate sufficient revenue by launching commercial, mapping, government, and GPS satellites, and by servicing the International Space Station, to ensure the company's financial stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>. This revenue stream will enable continuous technological improvement toward full reusability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>. Ultimately, the objective is to develop the necessary scale and sophistication to transport humans to Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>.

[[Elon Musk's donation to Khan Academy | Musk]] estimates that humans will likely reach Mars in approximately 12 years (from the time of the recording), with the aspirational goal of a round trip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>.

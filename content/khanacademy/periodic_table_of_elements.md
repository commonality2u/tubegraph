The [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | periodic table of elements]] is a fundamental component of chemistry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. It is commonly associated with the study of chemicals in vials, chemical equations depicting reactions, and molecular models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | periodic table]] itself is a significant part of what most people associate with chemistry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Essence and Purpose
At its core, chemistry, largely represented by the [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | periodic table]], helps humanity understand, build models, and make predictions about reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Although often taken for granted and seen at the front of any chemistry classroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, the [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | periodic table]] is the culmination of thousands of years of human effort to comprehend the world's complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

The world around us, including the entire universe, presents an infinite spectrum of seemingly different substances, such as fire, rock, and water, as well as complex phenomena like meteorological patterns and the electrochemical interactions within the human brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | periodic table]] provides a partial, yet highly advanced, answer to making sense of this overwhelming complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Building Blocks of Matter
The [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | periodic table of elements]] reveals that all observed complexity is fundamentally made of [[basic_building_blocks_of_matter | basic building blocks]], akin to LEGOs, which are finite in number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. While new [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | elements]] are not discovered frequently now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, certain [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | elements]] like carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen appear disproportionately in many different substances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

Furthermore, these [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | elements]] themselves are composed of subatomic particles—protons, electrons, and neutrons—which are rearranged in various ways to give [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | elements]] their distinct [[properties_of_substances_and_elements | properties]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This fundamental understanding is what chemistry seeks to model and explain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

## Chemistry's Place Among Sciences
Chemistry is closely related to [[relation_between_chemistry_and_other_sciences | physics]], building upon the foundational principles of mathematics and physics to understand how [[basic_building_blocks_of_matter | matter]] interacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. The interactions between atoms, as depicted in [[visualizing_and_understanding_equations | chemical equations]] and molecular structures, are based on quantum mechanical principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Chemistry leverages these principles to explain diverse phenomena, such as combustion, which involves hydrogen reacting with oxygen to produce energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

On top of chemistry, biology is built, as biological processes, including human speech and thought, are fundamentally based on complex molecular and [[interaction_and_behavior_of_atoms | atomic interactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. All sciences, from mathematics to psychology and economics, contribute to understanding reality, and none is more important than another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Chemistry provides models to understand interactions at scales and speeds that cannot be directly observed but allow for accurate predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

Studying chemistry, including the [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | periodic table]], is a privilege, offering answers that were unattainable even a century ago, and contributing to the ongoing, exciting journey of scientific discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

[[descriptive_statistics | Descriptive statistics]] involves summarizing and organizing data. Key basic measures include the mean, median, and mode, which help describe the [[measures_of_central_tendency | central tendency]] of a dataset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## The Mean

The mean is commonly referred to as the "average" in everyday language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. It is also sometimes called the [[mean_or_central_tendency_in_statistics | arithmetic mean]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

### Calculation
To calculate the mean, you sum up all the numbers in a dataset and then divide by the total count of numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

### Example
For the dataset: 23, 29, 20, 32, 23, 21, 33, 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>
1.  **Sum the numbers**: 23 + 29 + 20 + 32 + 23 + 21 + 33 + 25 = 206 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>
2.  **Count the numbers**: There are 8 numbers in the set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
3.  **Divide the sum by the count**: 206 / 8 = 25.75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
    *   Therefore, the mean is 25.75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

The mean is one method to measure the "center" or [[measures_of_central_tendency | central tendency]] of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## The Median

The median represents the middle number in a dataset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

### Calculation
To find the median, the numbers must first be ordered from least to greatest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

*   **Odd Number of Data Points**: If there is an odd number of values, the median is the single middle number.
*   **Even Number of Data Points**: If there is an even number of values, there will be two middle numbers. In this case, the median is the average (mean) of these two middle numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

### Example
For the dataset: 23, 29, 20, 32, 23, 21, 33, 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>
1.  **Order the numbers**: 20, 21, 23, 23, 25, 29, 32, 33 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
2.  **Identify middle number(s)**: Since there are 8 numbers (an even count), the two middle numbers are the 4th and 5th numbers: 23 and 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
3.  **Average the middle numbers**: (23 + 25) / 2 = 48 / 2 = 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
    *   Thus, the median is 24, even though 24 is not one of the original numbers in the set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

The median is another way to represent the [[measures_of_central_tendency | central tendency]] or "middle" of a dataset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## The Mode

The mode is simply the number that appears most frequently in a dataset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

### Example
For the dataset: 23, 29, 20, 32, 23, 21, 33, 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>
*   Each number appears once, except for 23, which appears twice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   Therefore, the mode is 23 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Choosing a Measure
> There isn't a single "correct" way to define the "middle" of a dataset; the mean, median, and mode each offer a different perspective on [[measures_of_central_tendency | central tendency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

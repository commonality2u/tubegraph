Energy is a fundamental concept in physics, often introduced alongside [[concept_of_work_in_physics | work]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. While the terms "work" and "energy" are used in everyday life, their specific meaning in physics, though related, is more precise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Conceptual Definitions

The verbal definitions of [[concept_of_work_in_physics | work]] and energy can seem circular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>:
*   **Work** is defined as energy transferred by a force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
*   **Energy** is defined as the ability to do [[concept_of_work_in_physics | work]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

These concepts are used to describe and understand phenomena like motion and force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. A more quantitative understanding emerges when exploring their [[definition_and_examples_of_equations | equations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## Units of Measurement

The standard unit for both [[concept_of_work_in_physics | work]] and energy is the **Joule (J)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. One Joule is equivalent to one Newton-meter (NÂ·m) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Forms of Energy

Energy exists in various forms. One significant form discussed is [[calculating_kinetic_energy | kinetic energy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

### Kinetic Energy
[[calculating_kinetic_energy | Kinetic energy]] is the energy an object possesses due to its motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. It can also be understood as the [[concept_of_work_in_physics | work]] required to accelerate an object from a stationary state to its current velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

The formula for [[calculating_kinetic_energy | kinetic energy]] (KE) is:
$KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>
Where:
*   $m$ is the mass of the object.
*   $v$ is the velocity of the object.

This formula is derived by considering the [[concept_of_work_in_physics | work]] done on an object and its resulting velocity change, using kinematic [[definition_and_examples_of_equations | equations]] and Newton's second law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

Further discussions will introduce other forms of energy and the law of conservation of energy, which explains how one form of energy can be converted into another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

The cellular membrane serves as the boundary that separates the cell from its external environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. It largely defines the cell as a small, distinct compartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. All cells possess a cellular membrane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Components and Function

Proteins destined for the cell's outer membrane, or for secretion outside the cell, are processed through a series of internal membrane structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. These proteins are translated by ribosomes attached to the [[endoplasmic_reticulum_and_golgi_bodies | Endoplasmic Reticulum]] (ER) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. As the protein is produced, it is pushed into the lumen of the ER <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. The protein then travels through the [[endoplasmic_reticulum_and_golgi_bodies | Endoplasmic Reticulum]], including the smooth ER, before reaching the [[endoplasmic_reticulum_and_golgi_bodies | Golgi Bodies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

### Vesicle Formation and Transport
From the [[endoplasmic_reticulum_and_golgi_bodies | Golgi Bodies]], proteins can "bud off" within a small section of the Golgi membrane, forming a vesicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. A vesicle is a general term for small, membrane-bound structures, typically containing proteins, that float around within the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. This mini-membrane allows the protein to travel to the cell's outer membrane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. The vesicle can then merge with the cellular membrane because they are made of similar material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>, allowing the protein to exit the cell or embed itself within the outer membrane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. The cellular membrane itself is a double layer, known as a bilipid layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.

## Additional Structures Related to Membranes

*   **Nucleus**: In eukaryotes, the [[DNA and cell function | DNA]] is enclosed within a membrane, forming the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Organelles**: Many cellular components are membrane-bound subunits of a cell, referred to as organelles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.
*   **Vacuoles**: A vacuole is a general term for a large, membrane-bound organelle that stores substances inside cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. Lytic vacuoles in plant cells are large vesicles storing enzymes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.
*   **Mitochondria**: These organelles, responsible for [[cellular_respiration_process | cellular respiration]] and [[stages_of_cellular_respiration | ATP production]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>, possess both inner and outer membranes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. Their ability to reproduce and contain their own [[DNA and cell function | DNA]] suggests their ancestors may have been independent prokaryotes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>.
*   **Chloroplasts**: Found in plant cells, chloroplasts are where photosynthesis takes place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>. Like mitochondria, they have their own [[DNA and cell function | DNA]] and ribosomes, leading to the belief that they were once independent prokaryotes that entered into a symbiotic relationship with larger eukaryotic cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.
*   **Cell Wall**: In non-animal cells, a cell wall provides additional strength and rigidity to the outer cellular membrane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. In plants, it is primarily composed of cellulose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>.

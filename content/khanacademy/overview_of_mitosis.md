Mitosis is a fundamental process of cell division, distinct from [[overview_of_meiosis | meiosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Process of Mitosis

In mitosis, a cell begins with a diploid number of chromosomes, denoted as 2n <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. For humans, this means starting with 46 chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. These 46 chromosomes are made up of 23 homologous pairs, with 23 chromosomes inherited from the mother and 23 from the father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

After the process of mitosis and cytokinesis, the result is two cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Each of these new cells contains the same genetic information and the same diploid number of chromosomes (2n) as the original cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Mitosis as a Cycle

Mitosis is a cyclical process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. The resulting cells can enter interphase, replicate their DNA and centrosomes, grow, and then undergo mitosis again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This cycle allows for continuous cell division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## Role of Mitosis

Mitosis is crucial for growth and development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. It is the primary mechanism by which most cells in the body grow and how a single-celled organism develops into a multicellular organism like a human being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Mitosis can also occur in germ cells, allowing them to produce more germ cells that maintain the diploid number of chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

### Somatic Cells
The cells that undergo mitosis are primarily **somatic cells** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. These cells form the bulk of an organism's body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

### Comparison to Meiosis
Unlike [[overview_of_meiosis | meiosis]], which produces gametes (sex cells) that are not part of a cycle for further division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, cells produced by mitosis are capable of continuing through the cell cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. While [[phases_of_meiosis | Meiosis Two]] is very similar to mitosis in its mechanics, it starts with haploid cells, whereas mitosis always begins with diploid cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

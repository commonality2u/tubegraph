[[overview_of_mitosis_and_meiosis | Mitosis]] is a fundamental cellular process involved in cell division and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. It is often compared to [[overview_of_meiosis | meiosis]], another type of cell division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Starting Cell

In [[overview_of_mitosis_and_meiosis | mitosis]], the process begins with a cell that has a diploid number of chromosomes, represented as 2n <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. For human beings, this means the cell contains 46 chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. These 46 chromosomes are composed of 23 chromosomes inherited from the mother and 23 from the father, forming 23 homologous pairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## The Process and Outcome

After the process of [[overview_of_mitosis_and_meiosis | mitosis]] and cytokinesis occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, the original cell divides into two new cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Each of these resulting cells possesses the exact same genetic information as the original parent cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a> and also retains the diploid number of chromosomes (2n) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

### Mitosis as a Cycle

A key characteristic of [[overview_of_mitosis_and_meiosis | mitosis]] is its cyclical nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. After division, each new cell can subsequently enter interphase again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, grow, replicate its DNA and centrosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, and then undergo [[overview_of_mitosis_and_meiosis | mitosis]] once more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This continuous cycle allows cells to keep dividing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## Function and Location

[[overview_of_mitosis_and_meiosis | Mitosis]] is the primary mechanism for the growth of most cells in the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. It is how a single-celled organism develops into a multicellular one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

This process predominantly occurs in **somatic cells** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, which constitute the majority of the body's tissues and organs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Additionally, **germ cells** can also undergo [[overview_of_mitosis_and_meiosis | mitosis]] to produce more germ cells that maintain a diploid number of chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. Germ cells are found in the testes in males and ovaries in females <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

From: [[khanacademy]] <br/> 

[[Completing the square]] is a technique used to solve [[quadratic equations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This method is universally applicable to any [[quadratic equations]] and forms the fundamental basis for the [[quadratic_formula_introduction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. While this video introduces the concept, the derivation of the [[quadratic_formula_introduction]] itself using [[completing_the_square]] will be covered in subsequent videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The technique builds upon prior knowledge of [[solving_quadratic_equations]] using perfect squares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Understanding the Technique

The essence of [[completing_the_square]] is to transform a [[quadratic equations]] so that one side becomes a "perfect square" trinomial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This is achieved by strategically adding and subtracting values from both sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### How to Make a Perfect Square

To make an expression like `x² + bx` into a perfect square `(x + a)²`, you need to add a specific number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
Recall that `(x + a)² = x² + 2ax + a²` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
To find the `a²` term to complete the square:
1.  Take the coefficient of the `x` term (which is `2a` in the general form `x² + 2ax + a²`).
2.  Divide it by 2 to find `a`.
3.  Square the result (`a²`). This is the number you need to add <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

### Example 1: Simple Quadratic Equation

Consider the [[quadratic equations]]: `x² - 4x = 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

1.  **Identify the coefficient of `x`**: It is -4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
2.  **Take half of the coefficient**: Half of -4 is -2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. (Here, `a` = -2).
3.  **Square the result**: `(-2)² = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
4.  **Add this number to both sides of the equation**:
    `x² - 4x + 4 = 5 + 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-0:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>
    `x² - 4x + 4 = 9` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>
5.  **Rewrite the left side as a perfect square**:
    `(x - 2)² = 9` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>
6.  **Solve by taking the square root of both sides**:
    `x - 2 = ±√9` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>
    `x - 2 = ±3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>
7.  **Isolate x**:
    `x = 2 ± 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>
    This gives two solutions:
    *   `x = 2 + 3 = 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>
    *   `x = 2 - 3 = -1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>

While this specific example could also be solved by [[factoring_quadratic_equations]] (e.g., `(x - 5)(x + 1) = 0`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, [[completing_the_square]] offers a method that "will always work" regardless of the coefficients or complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

### Example 2: More Complex Quadratic Equation

Consider `10x² - 30x - 8 = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

1.  **Simplify by dividing by a common factor (optional but helpful)**: Divide both sides by 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
    `5x² - 15x - 4 = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>
2.  **Ensure the leading coefficient is 1**: Divide the entire equation by the leading coefficient, 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
    `x² - 3x - 4/5 = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>
    This form makes [[factoring_quadratic_equations]] difficult due to the fraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
3.  **Move the constant term to the right side**: Add 4/5 to both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
    `x² - 3x = 4/5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>
4.  **Find the term to complete the square**:
    *   Coefficient of `x` is -3.
    *   Half of -3 is -3/2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
    *   Square -3/2: `(-3/2)² = 9/4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
5.  **Add 9/4 to both sides**:
    `x² - 3x + 9/4 = 4/5 + 9/4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>
6.  **Find a common denominator for the right side**:
    `4/5 = 16/20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>
    `9/4 = 45/20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>
    So, `4/5 + 9/4 = 16/20 + 45/20 = 61/20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
7.  **Rewrite the left side as a perfect square and simplify the right side**:
    `(x - 3/2)² = 61/20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>
8.  **Take the square root of both sides**:
    `x - 3/2 = ±√(61/20)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>
9.  **Isolate x**:
    `x = 3/2 ± √(61/20)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>

This final form of `x = 3/2 ± √(61/20)` yields solutions that would be extremely difficult to find through [[factoring_quadratic_equations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. Numerically, these solutions are approximately `x ≈ 3.246` and `x ≈ -0.246` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

[[Completing the square]] is a powerful [[completing_the_square_technique]] for [[solving_quadratic_equations]] because it reliably works for any quadratic expression, even those that are not easily factorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Its systematic approach makes it invaluable for [[solving_difficult_quadratic_equations]] and serves as the conceptual cornerstone for the [[quadratic_formula_introduction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

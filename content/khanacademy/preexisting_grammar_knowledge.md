Most individuals possess a significant amount of [[introduction_to_grammar | grammar]] knowledge simply from living and interacting in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. If one can understand spoken English, they already comprehend how to construct sentences and have an inherent grasp of [[introduction_to_grammar | grammar]] beyond what can be directly taught in these videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Purpose of Grammar Instruction

The primary aim of these videos is to provide formal names and structures to the [[introduction_to_grammar | grammar]] concepts that learners already intuitively understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This approach is intended to give individuals a greater command over their language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, allowing them to intentionally use English in various ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Focus on Standard American English

These instructional materials concentrate on a specific type of [[introduction_to_grammar | grammar]]: Standard American English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. It is crucial to recognize that numerous forms of English exist, all of which are considered valid, vibrant, important, and unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. The instruction is not designed to dictate "right" or "wrong" forms of English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Differences in speech patterns are perfectly acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Analogy: Car Assembly

The relationship between understanding [[introduction_to_grammar | grammar]] and existing knowledge can be likened to car assembly. The objective is to ensure the fundamental mechanics are sound, like wheels being correctly placed on the bottom of a car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. The aesthetic choices, such as the car's color (pink, green, purple, or paisley), are secondary and do not affect its basic function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. This reinforces the [[difference_between_conventions_and_rules_in_grammar | difference between conventions and rules]].

## Conclusion

Every individual is inherently a "grammarian," having studied [[introduction_to_grammar | grammar]] throughout their entire speaking and reading lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. The belief is that anyone can learn anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

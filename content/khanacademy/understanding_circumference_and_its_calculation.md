The circle is considered a fundamental shape in our universe, appearing in phenomena from planetary orbits to molecular structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Understanding the [[properties_of_a_circle | properties of the circle]] is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Fundamental Properties of a Circle

A circle is defined as all points that are equidistant from a central point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This means every point along the edge of the circle is the same distance from its center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### Radius

The constant distance from the center of a circle to any point on its edge is called the **radius** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. For any given circle, the radius remains constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### Diameter

The **diameter** of a circle is the distance across the circle through its widest point, which always passes through the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. The diameter is essentially made up of two radii <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Therefore, the [[relationship_between_diameter_and_radius | relationship between diameter and radius]] is expressed as:
$$
\text{Diameter} = 2 \times \text{Radius}
$$
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. These concepts are foundational for the [[definition_and_importance_of_radius_and_diameter | definition and importance of radius and diameter]] in geometry.

## Understanding Circumference

The **circumference** of a circle is the total distance around its edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. It is analogous to the [[understanding_perimeter_and_its_calculation_for_rectangles_and_squares | perimeter]] of other shapes.

### The Significance of Pi ($\pi$)

Thousands of years ago, mathematicians observed a consistent ratio when measuring the circumference and diameter of different circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Initially, with less precise tools, this ratio appeared to be roughly 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. As measurements became more accurate, the ratio was found to be closer to 3.1, then 3.14, and so on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. This number, which continues infinitely without repeating digits (e.g., 3.14159...), was recognized as a fundamental constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

This unique and ubiquitous number was given the name **Pi** (represented by the Greek letter $\pi$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

> "The ratio of the circumference of the diameter was this kind of magical number, they gave it a name. They called it pi." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>

Pi first appears as the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>:
$$
\frac{\text{Circumference}}{\text{Diameter}} = \pi
$$
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>

### Calculating Circumference

From the definition of Pi, we can derive the formulas for circumference:

1.  **Using Diameter**:
    Multiplying both sides of the ratio by the diameter (D):
    $$
    \text{Circumference} = \pi \times \text{Diameter} \quad (\text{C} = \pi \text{D})
    $$
    <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>

2.  **Using Radius**:
    Since the diameter is equal to two times the radius (D = 2r), we can substitute this into the formula:
    $$
    \text{Circumference} = \pi \times (2 \times \text{Radius})
    $$
    Rearranging this, the most common form for circumference is:
    $$
    \text{C} = 2 \pi \text{r}
    $$

### Examples of Circumference Calculation

#### Example 1: Given Radius

If a circle has a radius of 3 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>:
*   **Circumference**:
    Using the formula $C = 2\pi r$:
    $C = 2 \times \pi \times 3 \text{ meters}$
    $C = 6\pi \text{ meters}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>

    *Note:* It is common practice to leave answers in terms of $\pi$ unless an approximate numerical value is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. $\pi$ is just a number (approximately 3.14159) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   **Diameter**:
    Using the formula $D = 2r$:
    $D = 2 \times 3 \text{ meters}$
    $D = 6 \text{ meters}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>

#### Example 2: Given Circumference

If a circle has a circumference of 10 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>:
*   **Diameter**:
    Using the formula $C = \pi D$:
    $10 \text{ meters} = \pi \times D$
    Solving for D:
    $D = \frac{10}{\pi} \text{ meters}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>
*   **Radius**:
    Using the formula $r = \frac{1}{2} D$:
    $r = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{10}{\pi} \text{ meters}$
    $r = \frac{5}{\pi} \text{ meters}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>

Pi is a very special number, but it's important to remember that it is just a number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

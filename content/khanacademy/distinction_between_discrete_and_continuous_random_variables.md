[[understanding_random_variables | Random variables]] exist in two primary categories: [[discrete_vs_continuous_random_variables | discrete and continuous random variables]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## [[discrete_random_variables | Discrete Random Variables]]

[[discrete_random_variables | Discrete random variables]] are those that can assume distinct or separate values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The term "discrete" here signifies "distinct or separate values," not "polite" or "subtle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. A key characteristic is that you can count the number of different values they can take on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. While often dealing with a finite number of values, [[discrete_random_variables | discrete random variables]] can also have an infinite but countable number of potential values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. This means you can literally list the values, even if the list is infinite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

### [[examples_of_discrete_and_continuous_random_variables | Examples of Discrete Random Variables]]

*   **Coin Flip Outcome**
    A [[definition_of_a_random_variable | random variable]] *X* defined as 1 if a fair coin is heads and 0 if it's tails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. This variable can only take on the distinct values of 0 or 1, making it a [[discrete_random_variables | discrete random variable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

*   **Year of Birth for a Student**
    A [[definition_of_a_random_variable | random variable]] *Y* representing the year a random student in a class was born <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. This variable can take on specific, discrete years like 1992, 1985, or 2001, without taking on values in between <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

*   **Number of Ants Born**
    A [[definition_of_a_random_variable | random variable]] *Z* defined as the number of ants born tomorrow in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. The values are countable (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 5 quadrillion), making it a [[discrete_random_variables | discrete random variable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

*   **Olympic Winning Time (Rounded)**
    A [[definition_of_a_random_variable | random variable]] *X* representing the winning time for the men's 100-meter dash at the 2016 Olympics, *rounded to the nearest hundredth* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. Because the time is rounded, it can only take on specific, listable values like 9.56, 9.57, or 9.58 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

## [[continuous_random_variables | Continuous Random Variables]]

[[continuous_random_variables | Continuous random variables]] are able to take on any value within a given range or interval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This range can even be infinite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. For [[continuous_random_variables | continuous random variables]], it is impossible to list or count all possible values, as there are an infinite number of values between any two points in their range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

### [[examples_of_discrete_and_continuous_random_variables | Examples of Continuous Random Variables]]

*   **Exact Mass of an Animal**
    A [[definition_of_a_random_variable | random variable]] *Y* representing the exact mass of a random animal selected at the New Orleans Zoo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. The exact mass can take on any value within a range (e.g., between close to 0 kg and 5,000 kg), including decimals with infinite precision like 123.75921 kilograms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

*   **Exact Olympic Winning Time**
    A [[definition_of_a_random_variable | random variable]] *X* representing the exact winning time for the men's 100-meter dash at the 2016 Olympics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Even though clocks might round, the precise time could be any value within an interval (e.g., between 5 and 12 seconds), such as 9.571 or 9.572359 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

## Key Distinction

The fundamental difference between [[discrete_random_variables | discrete]] and [[continuous_random_variables | continuous random variables]] lies in whether their possible values can be counted or listed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. [[discrete_random_variables | Discrete variables]] have distinct, separable values that can be counted, even if the count is infinite. [[continuous_random_variables | Continuous variables]] can take on any value within an interval, meaning there are infinitely many values between any two points, and they cannot be counted or listed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

In [[introduction_to_geometry | geometry]], a **ray** is a fundamental concept that can be understood as a part of a line that extends infinitely in one direction but has a defined starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

## Definition and Characteristics

A ray is essentially like a line segment that you can keep going past one of its endpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. If you start at a point, for example, point A, and wish to move towards another point, like point D, but also have the option to continue moving past D indefinitely, this concept represents a ray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

*   **Starting Point (Vertex)**: The defined starting point of a ray is known as its vertex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. For instance, if a ray starts at point A and goes towards point D, A is the vertex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   **Dimensions**: A ray is considered a one-[[dimensions_in_geometry | dimensional]] figure, similar to a line segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. This means you can only move back and forth along its path, not up, down, or side to side off the path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

## Notation

To specify a ray, you denote its starting point (vertex) first, followed by another point that lies on the ray, with a small arrow symbol placed on top of the letters indicating the direction of infinite extension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

*   For a ray starting at point A and passing through point D, it is written as `AD` with an arrow over it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.
*   The order of the letters matters when naming a ray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. Ray `AD` is distinct from ray `DA` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Ray `DA` would imply starting at D and extending infinitely past A, which is a different ray from `AD` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

## Comparison to Other Geometric Concepts

Rays are part of a progression of geometric concepts defined by how much they extend in space:

*   **Point**: Has zero [[dimensions_in_geometry | dimensions]] and represents only a position, with no ability to move along it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.
*   **Line Segment**: A one-[[dimensions_in_geometry | dimensional]] object that connects two points and has a finite length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. It has two distinct endpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
*   **Ray**: A one-[[dimensions_in_geometry | dimensional]] object that has one defined starting point (vertex) and extends infinitely in only one direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.
*   **Line**: A one-[[dimensions_in_geometry | dimensional]] object that extends infinitely in both directions and has no endpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

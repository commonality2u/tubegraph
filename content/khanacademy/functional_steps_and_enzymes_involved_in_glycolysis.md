[[overview_of_glycolysis | Glycolysis]] is a crucial biochemical pathway present in almost all known life forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Its primary function is to break down glucose, a six-carbon molecule, into two molecules of pyruvate, each containing three carbons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This process generates a net of two ATPs and two NADH molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## Phases of Glycolysis

[[glycolysis_phases_and_process | Glycolysis]] proceeds through distinct phases: an initial investment phase where ATP is consumed, and a subsequent payoff phase where ATP and NADH are produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### Investment Phase (ATP Consumption)

The [[atp_investment_and_payoff_phases_in_glycolysis | investment phase]] involves the initial steps of glycolysis where ATP is utilized to prepare the glucose molecule for cleavage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

1.  **Phosphorylation of Glucose**:
    *   Glucose (a six-carbon molecule) is phosphorylated at the sixth carbon position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
    *   **Enzyme**: Hexokinase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Kinases are enzymes that facilitate phosphorylation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
    *   **Co-factor**: Magnesium ion (Mg²⁺) assists hexokinase in lowering activation energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
    *   **ATP Usage**: One ATP molecule is consumed, converting it to ADP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. This step is strongly favored to go from left to right due to coupled reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

2.  **Isomerization of Glucose-6-Phosphate**:
    *   Glucose 6-phosphate is converted into its isomer, fructose 6-phosphate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
    *   **Enzyme**: Phosphoglucose isomerase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Isomerases help convert one isomer of a molecule to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This reaction can go both ways, but product consumption pulls it forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

3.  **Phosphorylation of Fructose-6-Phosphate**:
    *   A second phosphate group is added to fructose 6-phosphate, forming fructose 1,6-bisphosphate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
    *   **Enzyme**: Phosphofructokinase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
    *   **ATP Usage**: Another ATP molecule is consumed, making it a total of two ATPs used in the investment phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. This is also a strong forward reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

4.  **Cleavage of Fructose 1,6-Bisphosphate**:
    *   The six-carbon fructose 1,6-bisphosphate is broken down into two three-carbon molecules: glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
    *   **Enzyme**: Fructose bisphosphate aldolase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Aldolase enzymes facilitate aldol reactions, in this case, breaking apart molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

5.  **Isomerization of Dihydroxyacetone Phosphate**:
    *   Dihydroxyacetone phosphate is converted into glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
    *   **Enzyme**: Triose phosphate isomerase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
    *   At this point, the process effectively has two molecules of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate for every initial glucose molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

### Payoff Phase (ATP and NADH Production)

The [[atp_investment_and_payoff_phases_in_glycolysis | payoff phase]] generates ATP and NADH, accounting for the net energy yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

1.  **Oxidation and Phosphorylation**:
    *   Each glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate molecule is oxidized, and an inorganic phosphate group is added, forming 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
    *   **Enzyme**: Dehydrogenase (specifically, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
    *   [[role_of_nad_and_nadh_in_glycolysis | NAD⁺]] is reduced to [[nad_reduction_to_nadh_during_glycolysis | NADH]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. Since there are two glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate molecules, two NADH molecules are produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. NADH can later be used in the electron transport chain to produce more ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

2.  **First ATP Production**:
    *   A phosphate group is removed from 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate and transferred to ADP, forming 3-phosphoglycerate and ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
    *   **Enzyme**: Phosphoglycerate kinase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
    *   **ATP Production**: Since this happens twice (for each of the two 3-carbon molecules), two ATP molecules are produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

3.  **Phosphate Group Relocation**:
    *   The phosphate group on 3-phosphoglycerate is moved from the third carbon to the second carbon, forming 2-phosphoglycerate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
    *   **Enzyme**: Phosphoglycerate mutase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. Mutases are a class of isomerases that move a functional group within a molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

4.  **Dehydration**:
    *   2-phosphoglycerate undergoes dehydration, removing a water molecule and forming phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
    *   **Enzyme**: Enolase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

5.  **Second ATP Production and Pyruvate Formation**:
    *   The phosphate group from phosphoenolpyruvate is transferred to ADP, yielding ATP and pyruvate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. This is considered the end of "mainstream glycolysis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
    *   **Enzyme**: Pyruvate kinase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. Kinases can also facilitate dephosphorylation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.
    *   **ATP Production**: As this step occurs twice, another two ATP molecules are produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

## Overall Products of Glycolysis

For every molecule of glucose, [[overall_equation_and_net_energy_yield_of_glycolysis | glycolysis]] produces:
*   **2 Pyruvate molecules** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>
*   **Net 2 ATP molecules**: (4 produced in payoff phase - 2 consumed in investment phase) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>
*   **2 NADH molecules** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>

## Beyond Glycolysis

[[glycolysis_and_its_role_in_cellular_respiration | Glycolysis]] is typically the initial stage of [[impact_of_glycolysis_in_cellular_respiration | cellular respiration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. If oxygen is available, the products (pyruvate and NADH) can proceed into the mitochondria for further energy generation through the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. In the absence of oxygen, cells will undergo anaerobic respiration or fermentation, primarily to regenerate NAD⁺ from NADH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

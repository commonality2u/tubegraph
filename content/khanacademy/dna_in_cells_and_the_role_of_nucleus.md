All cells contain [[DNA structure and its role in heredity | DNA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. [[DNA structure and its role in heredity | DNA]] is considered the defining characteristic of a living organism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Within a cell, [[DNA structure and its role in heredity | DNA]] is typically found in its chromatin form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, often associated with small proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## The Nucleus

Some cells possess a membrane that encloses the [[DNA structure and its role in heredity | DNA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This membrane-bound compartment, known as the nucleus, serves to separate the [[DNA structure and its role in heredity | DNA]] and chromatin from the rest of the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

### Nucleolus

Within the nucleus, there is a region called the nucleolus (or nucleole) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. The nucleolus is not a separate organelle and is not membrane-bound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Instead, it is a densely packed area of [[DNA structure and its role in heredity | DNA]] and [[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | RNA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Its primary function is the production of ribosomal [[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | RNA]], which forms the structural components of ribosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

### Role in [[gene_expression_and_its_significance | Gene Expression]]

The nucleus plays a crucial role in [[gene_expression_and_its_significance | gene expression]]:
*   [[DNA structure and its role in heredity | DNA]] inside the nucleus is transcribed into messenger [[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | RNA]] (mRNA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   This mRNA then leaves the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a> to be translated into proteins by ribosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

## Cell Classification Based on Nucleus

The presence or absence of a nucleus is a fundamental way to classify organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>:

### [[comparison_between_eukaryotes and prokaryotes | Eukaryotes]]
[[comparison_between_eukaryotes and prokaryotes | Eukaryotic]] cells are defined by the presence of a nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. These cells tend to be larger and more complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Examples of [[comparison_between_eukaryotes and prokaryotes | eukaryotes]] include plants, animals (like humans), and fungi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

### [[comparison_between_eukaryotes and prokaryotes | Prokaryotes]]
[[comparison_between_eukaryotes and prokaryotes | Prokaryotic]] cells do not have a nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. The two main groups of [[comparison_between_eukaryotes and prokaryotes | prokaryotes]] are bacteria and Archaea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. While originally thought to be types of bacteria, Archaea are now recognized as a distinct and fascinating group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Evolutionarily, it is considered more accurate to divide life into three primary domains: [[comparison_between_eukaryotes and prokaryotes | eukaryotes]], bacteria, and Archaea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

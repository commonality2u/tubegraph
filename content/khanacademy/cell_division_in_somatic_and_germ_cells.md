Cell division is a fundamental process for life, facilitating growth, repair, and reproduction. The two primary types of cell division, [[comparison_between_mitosis_and_meiosis | mitosis]] and [[overview_of_meiosis | meiosis]], serve distinct roles in the human body, occurring in different cell types.

## Mitosis in Somatic Cells

[[comparison_between_mitosis_and_meiosis | Mitosis]] is the process by which most cells in the body grow and multiply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. It is a cycle where cells can repeatedly go through the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

*   **Starting Cell:** A cell begins with a diploid number of chromosomes (2n) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. For human beings, this means 46 chromosomes, comprising 23 [[role_of_homologous_pairs_in_meiosis | homologous pairs]] (23 from each parent) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>.
*   **Process:** After [[cellular_structure_and_functions | interphase]], where DNA and centrosomes replicate, the cell undergoes [[comparison_between_mitosis_and_meiosis | mitosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.
*   **Result:** [[comparison_between_mitosis_and_meiosis | Mitosis]] yields two cells, each possessing the same genetic information and the diploid number of chromosomes (2n) as the original cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.
*   **Location:** [[comparison_between_mitosis_and_meiosis | Mitosis]] primarily occurs in somatic cells, which constitute the majority of the body's tissues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>. It is how an organism develops from a single cell into a multicellular being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.

## Meiosis in Germ Cells

[[overview_of_meiosis | Meiosis]] is a specialized cell division process involved in [[role_of_mitosis_and_meiosis_in_human_reproduction | sexual reproduction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>. Unlike [[comparison_between_mitosis_and_meiosis | mitosis]], [[overview_of_meiosis | meiosis]] is not a cycle; its resulting cells are used for [[role_of_mitosis_and_meiosis_in_human_reproduction | fertilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.

*   **Starting Cell:** Similar to [[comparison_between_mitosis_and_meiosis | mitosis]], [[overview_of_meiosis | meiosis]] begins with a cell that has a diploid number of chromosomes (2n), which replicates its DNA during interphase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.
*   **Process - Two Phases:** [[overview_of_meiosis | Meiosis]] unfolds in two main phases:

    *   **[[phases_of_meiosis | Meiosis One]] (Meiosis I):** The starting diploid cell divides into two cells, each with a haploid number of chromosomes (n) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. For humans, this means going from 46 chromosomes to 23 chromosomes per nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. This phase involves splitting the [[role_of_homologous_pairs_in_meiosis | homologous pairs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>, leading to genetic variation in the resulting cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.
    *   **[[phases_of_meiosis | Meiosis Two]] (Meiosis II):** Each of the two haploid cells from [[phases_of_meiosis | Meiosis One]] undergoes a second division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. This phase is similar to [[comparison_between_mitosis_and_meiosis | mitosis]], but it starts with haploid cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

*   **Result:** The entire process of [[overview_of_meiosis | meiosis]] culminates in four cells, each containing a haploid number of chromosomes (n) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. These resulting cells are [[gametogenesis | gametes]], or [[role_of_mitosis_and_meiosis_in_human_reproduction | sex cells]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>. They do not necessarily have the same genetic information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.
*   **Location:** [[overview_of_meiosis | Meiosis]] occurs in germ cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>. In males, this takes place in the testes to produce sperm cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. In females, it occurs in the ovaries to produce egg cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. Germ cells themselves can also undergo [[comparison_between_mitosis_and_meiosis | mitosis]] to produce more diploid germ cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.

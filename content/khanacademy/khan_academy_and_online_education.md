[[Khan Academy and online education | Khan Academy]] is widely recognized for its extensive collection of educational videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. These videos cover a vast range of subjects, from basic arithmetic to vector calculus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The platform currently serves approximately one million students per month, who collectively watch between 100,000 and 200,000 videos daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Origins and Early Impact

The genesis of [[Khan Academy and online education | Khan Academy]] began about five years prior to this discussion, when founder Salman Khan was an analyst at a hedge fund in Boston <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. He started tutoring his cousins in New Orleans remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, initially uploading the first YouTube videos as a supplementary resource for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

An early, profound insight came from his cousins, who preferred learning from him on YouTube rather than in person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. This seemingly "backhanded" compliment revealed key benefits of the automated approach:
*   **Self-Paced Learning** Students could pause and repeat concepts without feeling like they were wasting someone's time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Reduced Embarrassment** Learners could review foundational material they might have forgotten without embarrassment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **Privacy and Comfort** The act of grappling with a new concept could happen in the intimacy of their own room, free from the pressure of an immediate "do you understand this?" from another human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

Initially, the videos were made public on YouTube without specific intent, leading to unexpected engagement from random people worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Feedback included comments like "First time I smiled doing a derivative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a> and a user feeling a "natural high" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. More critically, letters began arriving, highlighting the profound impact, such as a video on decimals helping a 12-year-old son with autism grasp math concepts he previously struggled with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. This indicated the platform was more than just a "nice to have" resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

Khan also realized the content's longevity; fundamental concepts do not expire, potentially benefiting future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

## [[flipping_the_classroom_model | Flipping the Classroom]] and Humanizing Education

A significant development was feedback from teachers who began using the videos to [[flipping_the_classroom_model | flip the classroom]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. In this model, students watch lectures for homework, and traditional homework is done in the classroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. This approach offers the obvious benefit of self-paced lectures for students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

More profoundly, by removing the "one size fits all" lecture from the classroom, technology is used to [[personalized_learning_approaches | humanize the classroom]] experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Teachers can now circulate, and students can interact with peers, transforming a traditionally dehumanizing experience (30 silent kids listening to one lecture) into a collaborative and interactive one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

## Mastery-Based Learning and [[datadriven_insights_in_education | Data-Driven Insights]]

After becoming a not-for-profit organization, [[Khan Academy and online education | Khan Academy]] aimed to evolve this concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. The platform introduced interactive exercises designed for mastery, where users must correctly answer 10 consecutive questions to demonstrate understanding of a concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Hints and step-by-step solutions are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

This mastery-based model contrasts sharply with traditional classroom structures where students move on to the next topic after a snapshot exam, regardless of incomplete understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Salman Khan likens this to learning to ride a bicycle for two weeks, being graded as an "80% bicyclist," and then being given a unicycle, illustrating how "Swiss cheese gaps" in foundational knowledge can lead to future failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. [[Khan Academy and online education | Khan Academy]] encourages experimentation and failure while still expecting mastery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

All exercises fit into a comprehensive "knowledge map," starting from single-digit addition and progressing to advanced mathematics and potentially other subjects like computer programming, grammar, and genetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

### Pilot Program in Los Altos School District

In a pilot program in the Los Altos school district, two fifth-grade and two seventh-grade classes completely replaced their traditional math curriculum with [[Khan Academy and online education | Khan Academy]] software for half of their math class time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. This frees up classroom time for activities like simulations, games, and robotics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

Teachers use a live dashboard that displays student progress:
*   **Green:** Student is proficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
*   **Blue:** Student is working on the concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.
*   **Red:** Student is stuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.
Teachers can intervene with "red" students or have "green" students tutor their peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

The platform provides granular [[datadriven_insights_in_education | data-driven insights]] to teachers, including how long students spend daily, which videos they watch (and when they pause or stop), and specific problems attempted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. This allows teachers to diagnose issues and make interactions more productive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

A key observation from the Los Altos pilot is how [[personalized_learning_approaches | self-paced learning]] challenges traditional labels of "gifted" or "slow" students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. Students who initially take longer on certain concepts often "race ahead" once they achieve mastery, demonstrating that perceived differences in ability may simply be due to timing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

## [[global_education_and_accessibility | Global Vision and Accessibility]]

The goal of [[Khan Academy and online education | Khan Academy]] is to use technology to [[personalized_learning_approaches | humanize education]] on a global scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. It redefines the relevant metric in education from "student to teacher ratios" to "student to valuable human time with the teacher" ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. By offloading lectures and grading, teachers' time can be 100% dedicated to direct interaction with students, significantly [[personalized_learning_approaches | humanizing the classroom]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

This model holds immense potential for:
*   **Adult Learners** who may be embarrassed to review foundational knowledge before returning to college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.
*   **Students in Developing Countries** who might not be able to attend school full-time due to family responsibilities, allowing them to remediate or catch up at their own pace without embarrassment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.

The ultimate vision is a "global one world classroom," where students from different parts of the world, like a student in Calcutta and a child in America, can engage in peer-to-peer tutoring facilitated by the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.

## Platform Features and Future Readiness

[[Khan Academy and online education | Khan Academy]] incorporates game mechanics such as "energy points," "merit badges," and leaderboards to motivate learners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. The wording of badges and point allocation has been observed to influence the learning direction of tens of thousands of students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

The collaboration with Los Altos was unexpected, with the district enthusiastically adopting a radical approach of allowing every student to work at their own pace with teacher dashboards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>. The district can track student data continuously, even through summers and between teachers, providing unparalleled continuity of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>. Many of the teacher-facing features were designed based on direct feedback from educators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>.

With a million existing users, [[Khan Academy and online education | Khan Academy]] is considered ready for widespread adoption in classrooms across America and globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>. Individuals are also encouraged to use the coaching dashboards to become mentors or tutors for their family members or community groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.

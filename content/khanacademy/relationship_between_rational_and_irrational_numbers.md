## What Are Rational Numbers?
A [[rational_numbers_and_integer_representation | rational number]] is any number that can be represented as the ratio of two integers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This means it can be written as a fraction a/b, where 'a' and 'b' are integers and 'b' is not zero.

### Integers as Rational Numbers
Any integer is considered a [[rational_numbers_and_integer_representation | rational number]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   The number 1 can be represented as 1/1, -2/-2, or 10,000/10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. There are an infinite number of ways to represent 1 as the ratio of two integers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   The number -7 can be represented as -7/1, 7/-1, or -14/2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Therefore, -7 is a [[rational_numbers_and_integer_representation | rational number]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Non-Integer Decimals as Rational Numbers
Numbers that are not integers can also be [[rational_numbers_and_integer_representation | rational numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Finite Decimals:** For example, 3.75 can be written as 375/100, which simplifies to 15/4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This can also be expressed as -30/-8, demonstrating multiple integer ratio representations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

*   **[[repeating_decimals_as_rational_numbers | Repeating Decimals]]**: Any [[repeating_decimals_as_rational_numbers | repeating decimal]] can be represented as the ratio of two integers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
    *   0.333... (0.3 repeating) is equal to 1/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
    *   0.666... (0.6 repeating) is equal to 2/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
    *   Even if a decimal has millions of digits repeating, as long as the pattern repeats, it can be represented as a ratio of two integers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

In summary, [[rational_numbers_and_integer_representation | rational numbers]] include all integers, finite non-repeating decimals, and [[repeating_decimals_as_rational_numbers | repeating decimals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

## What Are Irrational Numbers?
Not all numbers are [[rational_numbers_and_integer_representation | rational numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Numbers that cannot be represented as the ratio of two integers are called [[irrational_numbers_and_their_characteristics | irrational numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Some of the most famous numbers in mathematics are [[irrational_numbers_and_their_characteristics | irrational numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

Key characteristics of [[irrational_numbers_and_their_characteristics | irrational numbers]]:
*   They never terminate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   Their decimal representation never repeats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

Examples of [[irrational_numbers_and_their_characteristics | irrational numbers]]:
*   **Pi (π)**: The ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **e**: Euler's number, found in continuous compounding and complex analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   **Square root of 2 (√2)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   **Phi (φ)**: The golden ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   The square root of any non-perfect square is an [[irrational_numbers_and_their_characteristics | irrational number]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

Many numbers that "pop out of nature" are [[irrational_numbers_and_their_characteristics | irrational numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Relationship and Prevalence
While [[irrational_numbers_and_their_characteristics | irrational numbers]] might seem exotic, they are not uncommon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   **Density**: There is always an [[irrational_numbers_and_their_characteristics | irrational number]] between any two [[rational_numbers_and_integer_representation | rational numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. In fact, there is an infinite number of [[irrational_numbers_and_their_characteristics | irrational numbers]] between any two [[rational_numbers_and_integer_representation | rational numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This means you cannot claim there are fewer [[irrational_numbers_and_their_characteristics | irrational numbers]] than [[rational_numbers_and_integer_representation | rational numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

*   **Operations**:
    *   The sum of an [[irrational_numbers_and_their_characteristics | irrational number]] and a [[rational_numbers_and_integer_representation | rational number]] will be an [[irrational_numbers_and_their_characteristics | irrational number]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
    *   The product of an [[irrational_numbers_and_their_characteristics | irrational number]] and a [[rational_numbers_and_integer_representation | rational number]] will also be an [[irrational_numbers_and_their_characteristics | irrational number]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

These properties indicate that there are a vast number of [[irrational_numbers_and_their_characteristics | irrational numbers]] in the real number system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

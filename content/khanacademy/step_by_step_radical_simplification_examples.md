[[simplifying_radicals | Simplifying radicals]] involves transforming an expression with a radical (square root symbol) into a simpler form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This process is an extension of [[exponent_rules_and_radicals | exponent rules]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## What is a Radical?

A radical is typically referred to as the square root symbol (√) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. For example, the square root of 36 (√36) is 6, because 6 multiplied by 6 equals 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Underlying Exponent Rule

The square root of a number is equivalent to raising that number to the 1/2 power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Based on [[exponent_rules_and_radicals | exponent rules]], when two numbers are multiplied and then raised to a power (like 1/2), it's the same as raising each number to that power individually and then multiplying the results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

This means:
√(a × b) = (a × b)^(1/2) = a^(1/2) × b^(1/2) = √a × √b <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>

This rule is fundamental to [[simplifying_radicals | simplifying radicals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

## How to Simplify Radicals

To simplify a radical, identify factors of the number under the radical sign that are perfect squares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. The goal is to find the largest factor that is a perfect square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Common perfect squares include: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, and so on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Once a perfect square factor is found, it can be "taken out" of the radical sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

### Example 1: Simplifying √72

Let's simplify √72 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
1.  Identify factors of 72. We know 72 is 36 × 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
    *   √72 = √(36 × 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>
2.  Apply the exponent rule to separate the radical into two parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
    *   √(36 × 2) = √36 × √2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>
3.  Calculate the square root of the perfect square. √36 is 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
    *   √36 × √2 = 6 × √2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>
    *   **Result:** 6√2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>

### Example 2: Simplifying √50

Let's simplify √50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
1.  Find the largest perfect square factor of 50. We know 50 is 25 × 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. (25 is a perfect square, 5 and 10 are not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>).
    *   √50 = √(25 × 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>
2.  Separate the radical.
    *   √(25 × 2) = √25 × √2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>
3.  Calculate the square root of the perfect square. √25 is 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
    *   √25 × √2 = 5 × √2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>
    *   **Result:** 5√2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>

### Example 3: Simplifying 7√27

Let's simplify 7√27 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
1.  Identify the largest perfect square factor of 27. 9 is a factor and a perfect square (9 × 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
    *   7√27 = 7√(9 × 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>
2.  Separate the radical.
    *   7√(9 × 3) = 7 × √9 × √3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>
3.  Calculate the square root of the perfect square. √9 is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
    *   7 × 3 × √3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>
4.  Multiply the outside numbers.
    *   **Result:** 21√3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>

### Example 4: Simplifying 9√18

Let's simplify 9√18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
1.  Identify the largest perfect square factor of 18. 9 is a factor and a perfect square (9 × 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
    *   9√18 = 9√(2 × 9) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>
2.  Separate the radical.
    *   9√(2 × 9) = 9 × √2 × √9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>
3.  Calculate the square root of the perfect square. √9 is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
    *   9 × √2 × 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>
4.  Multiply the outside numbers.
    *   **Result:** 27√2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>

### Example 5: Simplifying 4√25

This is a simpler case as 25 is itself a perfect square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.
1.  Calculate the square root of 25. √25 is 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
    *   4√25 = 4 × 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>
    *   **Result:** 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>

### Example 6: Simplifying 3√29

Sometimes, a radical cannot be simplified further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
1.  Consider the factors of 29. 29 is a prime number, with only factors 1 and 29 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
2.  Neither 1 nor 29 are perfect squares that allow for simplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
    *   **Result:** 3√29 (already in simplified form) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>

### Example 7: Simplifying 7√320 (Multi-Step Simplification)

For larger numbers, simplification might require multiple steps if the largest perfect square factor isn't immediately obvious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
1.  Identify an initial perfect square factor of 320. 16 goes into 320 (320 = 16 × 20) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
    *   7√320 = 7√(16 × 20) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>
2.  Separate the radical and simplify the perfect square. √16 is 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
    *   7 × √16 × √20 = 7 × 4 × √20 = 28√20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>
3.  Check if the remaining number under the radical (20) can be simplified further. Yes, 20 contains a perfect square factor of 4 (20 = 4 × 5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.
    *   28√20 = 28√(4 × 5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>
4.  Separate the radical and simplify the new perfect square. √4 is 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
    *   28 × √4 × √5 = 28 × 2 × √5 = 56√5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>
5.  Check if the remaining number (5) can be simplified. No, 5 is a prime number.
    *   **Result:** 56√5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>

This demonstrates that it's acceptable to take out perfect square factors in multiple steps until the number under the radical can no longer be reduced by a perfect square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

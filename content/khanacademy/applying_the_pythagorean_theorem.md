This article serves as an [[introduction_to_the_pythagorean_theorem | introduction to the Pythagorean theorem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It is a cornerstone theorem in mathematics, useful in geometry and serving as the backbone of [[application_of_trigonometry_in_right_triangles | trigonometry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. It is also used for [[calculating_the_hypotenuse_and_other_sides | calculating distances]] between points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Introduction to the [[introduction_to_the_pythagorean_theorem | Pythagorean Theorem]]

The [[introduction_to_the_pythagorean_theorem | Pythagorean theorem]] applies specifically to right triangles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

### What is a Right Triangle?
A right triangle is a triangle where one of its three angles measures exactly 90 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This 90-degree angle, also known as a right angle, is typically indicated by a small square drawn at the vertex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

### Identifying the Hypotenuse
In a right triangle, the longest side is called the hypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. The hypotenuse is always the side located directly opposite the 90-degree angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   To identify the hypotenuse, locate the right angle and follow the direction it "opens into" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

## The [[using_the_pythagorean_theorem | Pythagorean Theorem]] Formula
If you know the lengths of any two sides of a right triangle, you can always determine the length of the third side using the [[using_the_pythagorean_theorem | Pythagorean theorem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

Let:
*   `C` be the length of the hypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   `A` and `B` be the lengths of the two shorter sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

The theorem states:
> A² + B² = C² <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>
>
> Or, the square of the length of one shorter side plus the square of the length of the other shorter side is equal to the square of the length of the hypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

## Examples of Application

### Solving for the Hypotenuse
Consider a right triangle with two shorter sides measuring 3 units and 4 units, and an unknown hypotenuse `C` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

1.  **Identify the hypotenuse**: The unknown side is opposite the right angle, making it the hypotenuse (`C`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
2.  **Apply the formula**:
    *   4² + 3² = C² <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>
3.  **Calculate the squares**:
    *   16 + 9 = C² <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>
4.  **Sum the values**:
    *   25 = C² <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>
5.  **Solve for C**: Take the positive square root of both sides (since dealing with distances) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
    *   C = 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>
    Thus, the length of the hypotenuse is 5 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

### Solving for a Shorter Side
Consider a right triangle with a hypotenuse of 12 units and one shorter side of 6 units, with the other shorter side `B` unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

1.  **Identify the hypotenuse**: The side with length 12 is opposite the right angle, so it is the hypotenuse (`C`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
    *   So, C = 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
    *   Let A = 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
    *   `B` is the unknown side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
2.  **Apply the formula**:
    *   6² + B² = 12² <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>
3.  **Calculate the squares**:
    *   36 + B² = 144 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>
4.  **Isolate B²**: Subtract 36 from both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
    *   B² = 144 - 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>
    *   B² = 108 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>
5.  **Solve for B**: Take the positive square root of both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
    *   B = √108 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>

#### Simplifying Radicals
Often, when [[using_the_pythagorean_theorem | applying the Pythagorean theorem]], you may need to simplify radicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. To simplify √108:
1.  **Find the prime factorization of 108**:
    *   108 = 2 × 54 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>
    *   54 = 2 × 27 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>
    *   27 = 3 × 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>
    *   9 = 3 × 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>
    *   So, 108 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
2.  **Rewrite the square root using factors with perfect squares**:
    *   √108 = √(2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>
    *   √108 = √(2 × 2) × √(3 × 3) × √3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>
    *   √108 = √4 × √9 × √3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>
    *   √108 = 2 × 3 × √3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>
3.  **Simplify**:
    *   B = 6√3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>
    Thus, the length of the unknown side is 6√3 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

[[overview_of_glycolysis | Glycolysis]] is a fundamental biochemical pathway in nearly all forms of life, centered on breaking down glucose for energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This process involves two main stages: the investment phase and the payoff phase, resulting in the production of two pyruvate molecules from one glucose molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Overview of ATP Production

[[glycolysis | Glycolysis]] ultimately produces a net of two ATP molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This net gain is a result of an initial energy expenditure followed by a larger energy recovery:
*   **Investment Phase**: Two ATPs are consumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   **Payoff Phase**: Four ATPs are produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   **Net ATP**: A total of plus two ATPs are produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

Beyond ATP, [[glycolysis | glycolysis]] also involves the [[reduction_of_nad_to_nadh_in_glycolysis | reduction of NAD+ to NADH]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Two molecules of NAD+ are reduced to two molecules of NADH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. NADH serves as an electron carrier, and its electrons can later be used in the electron transport chain to produce additional ATP via oxidative phosphorylation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

[[glycolysis | Glycolysis]] is typically the initial step of [[cellular_respiration_phases | cellular respiration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. In the presence of oxygen, its products can proceed to the mitochondria for the [[krebs_cycle_and_pyruvate_oxidation | citric acid cycle]] and oxidative phosphorylation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Without oxygen, anaerobic respiration or fermentation occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## The Investment Phase

This phase requires an input of two ATP molecules to prepare the glucose molecule for cleavage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

1.  **Phosphorylation of Glucose**: The first step involves the phosphorylation of glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
    *   **Enzyme**: Hexokinase facilitates this reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Kinases are enzymes that manage phosphorylation or dephosphorylation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
    *   **Co-factor**: A magnesium ion (Mg²⁺) acts as a co-factor, helping the enzyme lower the activation energy for the reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
    *   **ATP Consumption**: One ATP molecule is consumed, converting glucose into glucose-6-phosphate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. This reaction is strongly favored from left to right due to being coupled with ATP hydrolysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

2.  **Isomerization**: Glucose-6-phosphate is then isomerized to fructose-6-phosphate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
    *   **Enzyme**: Phosphoglucose isomerase facilitates this conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Isomerases help convert one isomer of a molecule to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This particular reaction can go in both directions, but the pathway generally proceeds forward due to the continuous consumption of products further along <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

3.  **Second Phosphorylation**: Fructose-6-phosphate undergoes a second phosphorylation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
    *   **Enzyme**: Phosphofructokinase facilitates this reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
    *   **ATP Consumption**: Another ATP molecule is consumed, adding a second phosphate group to form fructose-1,6-bisphosphate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. This also involves a magnesium co-factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
    *   At this point, a total of two ATP molecules have been invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

4.  **Cleavage of the Molecule**: Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is then broken down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
    *   **Enzyme**: Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, an aldolase enzyme, facilitates this cleavage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
    *   **Products**: It breaks into two three-carbon molecules: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
    *   **Isomerization**: Dihydroxyacetone phosphate can be converted into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate by the enzyme triose phosphate isomerase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. This means that from this point forward, the [[glycolysis_process | glycolysis process]] essentially proceeds with two molecules of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

## The Payoff Phase

This phase begins after the glucose molecule has been cleaved into two three-carbon molecules (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate). All reactions in this phase occur twice for every initial glucose molecule.

1.  **Oxidation and Phosphorylation**: Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate is oxidized, and an inorganic phosphate group is added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
    *   **Enzyme**: Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase facilitates this reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
    *   **NADH Production**: During this step, NAD+ is reduced to NADH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. Since this happens for both three-carbon molecules, two NADHs are produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

2.  **First ATP Production (Substrate-Level Phosphorylation)**: The newly formed 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate transfers one of its phosphate groups to ADP, generating ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
    *   **Enzyme**: Phosphoglycerate kinase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
    *   **ATP Production**: Since this occurs for both molecules, two ATPs are produced in this step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

3.  **Phosphate Group Relocation**: The phosphate group on 3-phosphoglycerate is moved from the 3rd carbon to the 2nd carbon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
    *   **Enzyme**: Phosphoglycerate mutase, a type of isomerase, performs this relocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

4.  **Dehydration**: 2-phosphoglycerate undergoes dehydration, forming phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
    *   **Enzyme**: Enolase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

5.  **Second ATP Production (Substrate-Level Phosphorylation)**: The final step of [[glycolysis_process_and_outcomes | glycolysis]] involves the transfer of PEP's phosphate group to ADP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.
    *   **Enzyme**: Pyruvate kinase, another kinase, facilitates this dephosphorylation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
    *   **ATP Production**: This generates two more ATP molecules (one for each pyruvate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
    *   **Product**: The end product is pyruvate (or pyruvic acid, depending on protonation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

In summary, the [[glycolysis | glycolysis]] pathway consumes two ATPs in its investment phase to prepare glucose, and then generates four ATPs and two NADHs in its payoff phase, leading to a net gain of two ATPs and two NADHs per glucose molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

[[basics_of_multiplication | Multiplication]], represented by the word "times," is a fundamental arithmetic operation that simplifies counting and is a form of [[Multiplication as repeated addition | repeated addition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## Understanding Multiplication through Examples

To understand [[basics_of_multiplication | multiplication]], it's helpful to work through examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

### Multiplication vs. Addition

Unlike simple addition (e.g., 2 + 3 = 5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, where two numbers are combined, [[basics_of_multiplication | multiplication]] involves adding a number to itself a specified number of times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

For example, for "2 times 3":
*   You can add 2 to itself three times: 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The '3' indicates how many 2's are being added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   Alternatively, you can add 3 to itself two times: 3 + 3 = 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Here, the '2' indicates how many 3's are being added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

Regardless of how it's interpreted, the result of 2 times 3 is 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. This demonstrates a key property where different correct paths lead to the same answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

## Utility of Multiplication

[[basics_of_multiplication | Multiplication]] is useful because it simplifies counting, especially in situations where items are arranged in groups or arrays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

Consider an arrangement of lemons in rows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>:
If there are 3 lemons in each row and 4 rows, you could count each lemon individually to find there are 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. However, a faster way is to use [[basics_of_multiplication | multiplication]]: 4 times 3 lemons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

This means:
*   "4 times 3" can be thought of as adding 3 to itself four times: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   It can also be interpreted as "3 times 4" or adding 4 to itself three times: 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. This highlights the commutative property of [[basics_of_multiplication | multiplication]], where switching the order of the numbers does not change the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

Some people might refer to "4 times 3" as "four 3's" (one 3, two 3's, three 3's, four 3's) or "three 4's" (one 4, two 4's, three 4's), which can be more intuitive for [[Visualizing multiplication in equations | visualizing]] the repeated addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. These are all ways of calculating [[multiples_of_numbers | multiples]] and yield 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

While counting 12 lemons is quick, [[basics_of_multiplication | multiplication]] becomes indispensable when dealing with larger numbers, such as 100 lemons per row and 100 rows, where individual counting would take too long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

## Special Properties of Multiplication

### Multiplying by One (Identity Property)

When any number is multiplied by 1, the result is the original number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
*   3 times 1 means "three 1's" (1 + 1 + 1 = 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.
*   It can also mean "3 one time" (just 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.
*   For example, 100 times 1 equals 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
*   And 1 times 39 equals 39 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

### Multiplying by Zero (Zero Property)

When any number is multiplied by 0, the result is always 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.
*   For example, 4 times 0 means "0 four times" (0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.
*   It can also mean "4 zero times," implying nothing is written down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.
*   A large number like 5,493,692 times 0 still equals 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.
*   Similarly, 0 times 17 is 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

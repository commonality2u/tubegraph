This article focuses on the process of [[simplifying fractions | simplifying fractions]], particularly in the context of [[multiplying_fractions | multiplying fractions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## How to Multiply Fractions

When [[multiplying_fractions | multiplying fractions]], the process is straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
The numerator of the product is found by [[multiplying_fractions | multiplying]] the two numerators together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Similarly, the denominator of the product is found by [[multiplying_fractions | multiplying]] the two denominators together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

For example, to [[multiplying_fractions | multiply]] 5/6 by 2/3:
*   **Numerator**: 5 * 2 = 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>
*   **Denominator**: 6 * 3 = 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>
This results in the product 10/18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## [[simplifying_fractions | Simplifying Fractions]] After Multiplication

Once fractions are multiplied, the resulting fraction can often be [[simplifying_fractions | simplified]] to its [[simplifying_fractions_to_lowest_terms | lowest terms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This involves finding common factors between the numerator and the denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

For the example of 10/18:
1.  Identify common factors: Both 10 and 18 are divisible by 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
2.  Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the common factor:
    *   10 รท 2 = 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>
    *   18 รท 2 = 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>
3.  The [[simplifying_fractions_to_lowest_terms | lowest terms]] fraction is 5/9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## [[simplifying_fractions | Simplifying Fractions]] Before Multiplication

It is also possible and often easier to [[simplifying_fractions | simplify fractions]] *before* performing the multiplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This can be done by looking for common factors between any numerator and any denominator in the multiplication expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

Using the same example, 5/6 times 2/3:
1.  Observe that the numerator 2 (from 2/3) and the denominator 6 (from 5/6) share a common factor of 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
2.  Divide both numbers by their common factor:
    *   Divide the numerator 2 by 2, which becomes 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
    *   Divide the denominator 6 by 2, which becomes 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
3.  The expression now becomes 5/3 times 1/3 (conceptually) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
4.  [[multiplying_fractions | Multiply]] the new numbers:
    *   Numerator: 5 * 1 = 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>
    *   Denominator: 3 * 3 = 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>
5.  The result is 5/9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

This method achieves the same final simplified answer as [[simplifying_fractions | simplifying]] after multiplication, but it can make it easier to identify common factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

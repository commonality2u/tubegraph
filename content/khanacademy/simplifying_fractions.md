When [[converting_fractions_to_decimals | converting decimals to fractions]], the resulting fraction can often be [[Simplifying rational expressions | simplified]] to its simplest form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26">[08:26]</a>. This involves dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35">[08:35]</a>.

## Example: Simplifying 35/1,000

Consider the decimal 0.035, which can be written as the fraction 35/1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06">[07:06]</a>. To simplify this fraction, find a number that can divide both 35 and 1,000 evenly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35">[08:35]</a>.

In this case, both numbers are divisible by 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35">[08:35]</a>:
*   Divide the numerator (35) by 5: `35 รท 5 = 7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38">[08:38]</a>
*   Divide the denominator (1,000) by 5: `1,000 รท 5 = 200` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38">[08:38]</a>

Therefore, 35/1,000 simplifies to 7/200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40">[08:40]</a>. This is the simplest form because 7 and 200 share no common divisors other than 1. You can verify this by [[converting_fractions_to_decimals | converting 7/200 back to a decimal]], which should result in 0.035 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47">[08:47]</a>.

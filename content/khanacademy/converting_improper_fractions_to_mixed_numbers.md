When performing operations like [[adding_fractions_with_different_denominators | adding fractions with different denominators]], the result may be an [[improper_fractions_as_decimals | improper fraction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. An improper fraction is one where the numerator is larger than or equal to the denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. It is often necessary to convert these to a mixed number, which consists of a whole number and a proper fraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Definition

An [[improper_fractions_as_decimals | improper fraction]] is a fraction where the numerator (top number) is larger than the denominator (bottom number) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

## Steps for Conversion

To convert an [[improper_fractions_as_decimals | improper fraction]] to a mixed number, follow these steps:

1.  **Divide the numerator by the denominator** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. The quotient (the number of times the denominator goes into the numerator) becomes the whole number part of the mixed number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
2.  **Determine the remainder** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. This remainder becomes the new numerator of the fractional part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
3.  **Keep the original denominator** for the fractional part of the mixed number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

### Example: Converting 49/36 to a Mixed Number

Suppose you have the improper fraction 49/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

1.  **Divide the numerator (49) by the denominator (36)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>:
    *   36 goes into 49 one time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. This means the whole number part of the mixed number is 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

2.  **Calculate the remainder**:
    *   Multiply the whole number (1) by the original denominator (36): `1 * 36 = 36` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
    *   Subtract this product from the original numerator: `49 - 36 = 13` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. The remainder is 13.

3.  **Form the mixed number**:
    *   The whole number is 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
    *   The new numerator is the remainder, 13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
    *   The denominator remains 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

Therefore, 49/36 as a mixed number is `1 and 13/36` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

### Manual Division Process

You can visualize this process using long division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>:

```
      1  <-- Whole number part
   ____
36 | 49
     -36
     ---
      13 <-- Remainder (new numerator)
```

The remainder, 13, becomes the numerator of the fractional part, and the original divisor, 36, remains the denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. So, the final answer is `1 and 13/36` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

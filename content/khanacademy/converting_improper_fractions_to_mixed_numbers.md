When working with fractions, it is often necessary to express an improper fraction as a mixed number. An improper fraction is a fraction where the numerator (top number) is larger than or equal to the denominator (bottom number) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.

## Conversion Process

To convert an improper fraction to a mixed number, follow these steps:

1.  **Divide the numerator by the denominator** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.
2.  The **quotient** (the whole number result of the division) becomes the whole number part of the mixed number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.
3.  The **remainder** of the division becomes the new numerator of the fractional part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.
4.  The **denominator** remains the same as the original improper fraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.

## Example: Converting 49/36 to a Mixed Number

Let's say we have the improper fraction 49/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.

1.  **Divide 49 by 36** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.
    *   36 goes into 49 one time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.
    *   $1 \times 36 = 36$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.

2.  **Determine the remainder**:
    *   Subtract 36 from 49: $49 - 36 = 13$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.
    *   The remainder is 13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.

3.  **Construct the mixed number**:
    *   The whole number is 1 (the quotient) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.
    *   The new numerator is 13 (the remainder) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.
    *   The denominator remains 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.

Therefore, 49/36 as a mixed number is $1\frac{13}{36}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. This result may occur after operations such as [[adding_fractions_with_different_denominators | adding fractions with different denominators]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a> or [[multiplying_fractions | multiplying fractions]]. Before or after conversion, it's also important to check if the fraction can be [[simplifying_fractions | simplified]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

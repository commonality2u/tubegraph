When working with fractions, it is sometimes necessary to convert an [[working_with_improper_fractions | improper fraction]] into a mixed number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. An [[working_with_improper_fractions | improper fraction]] is a fraction where the numerator (top number) is larger than or equal to the denominator (bottom number) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

## Definition of Mixed Number

A mixed number combines a whole number and a proper fraction (where the numerator is smaller than the denominator) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

## Steps to Convert

To convert an [[working_with_improper_fractions | improper fraction]] to a mixed number, you divide the numerator by the denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

1.  **Divide the numerator by the denominator**: Perform division to find out how many times the denominator goes into the numerator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. The quotient will be the whole number part of the mixed number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
2.  **Determine the remainder**: After the division, find the remainder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. This remainder becomes the new numerator of the fractional part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
3.  **Keep the original denominator**: The denominator of the fractional part remains the same as the original [[working_with_improper_fractions | improper fraction]]'s denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

### Example: Converting 49/36

Consider the [[working_with_improper_fractions | improper fraction]] 49/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

*   **Step 1: Divide**
    Divide 49 by 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
    ```
    49 รท 36 = 1 (with a remainder)
    ```
    36 goes into 49 one time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. This '1' is the whole number part of the mixed number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

*   **Step 2: Find the Remainder**
    Multiply the whole number (1) by the original denominator (36): 1 * 36 = 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
    Subtract this product from the original numerator: 49 - 36 = 13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
    The remainder is 13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

*   **Step 3: Form the Mixed Number**
    The mixed number is the whole number, followed by the remainder as the new numerator, and the original denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
    So, 49/36 converts to 1 and 13/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

You can perform the division manually as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>:
```
      1
    ____
36 | 49
     -36
     ---
      13
```
Here, 1 is the quotient (whole number), and 13 is the remainder (new numerator) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. The denominator remains 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

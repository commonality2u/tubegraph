The [[cellular_structure_and_functions | cellular membrane]] serves as the primary boundary of a cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. It is crucial because it separates the cell from its external environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, effectively defining it as a distinct, small compartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. All cells possess a [[cellular_structure_and_functions | cellular membrane]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Function in Protein Transport

The [[cellular_structure_and_functions | cellular membrane]] plays a vital role in directing proteins within and out of the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
When proteins are destined for incorporation into cellular membranes or for secretion outside the cell, they are processed through specific pathways involving membrane-bound [[organelle_functions_such_as_ribosomes_endoplasmic_reticulum_and_golgi_bodies | ribosomes]], the [[organelle_functions_such_as_ribosomes_endoplasmic_reticulum_and_golgi_bodies | endoplasmic reticulum]], and [[organelle_functions_such_as_ribosomes_endoplasmic_reticulum_and_golgi_bodies | Golgi bodies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

Proteins are translated by [[organelle_functions_such_as_ribosomes_endoplasmic_reticulum_and_golgi_bodies | ribosomes]] attached to the rough [[organelle_functions_such_as_ribosomes_endoplasmic_reticulum_and_golgi_bodies | endoplasmic reticulum]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. As the protein is formed, it is pushed into the inner compartment of the [[organelle_functions_such_as_ribosomes_endoplasmic_reticulum_and_golgi_bodies | endoplasmic reticulum]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. These proteins then travel through the [[organelle_functions_such_as_ribosomes_endoplasmic_reticulum_and_golgi_bodies | endoplasmic reticulum]] to the [[organelle_functions_such_as_ribosomes_endoplasmic_reticulum_and_golbi_bodies | Golgi bodies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

From the [[organelle_functions_such_as_ribosomes_endoplasmic_reticulum_and_golgi_bodies | Golgi bodies]], proteins can bud off, taking a small portion of the [[Golgi body]]'s membrane with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. This membrane-bound structure is called a vesicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. The vesicle's mini-membrane allows the protein to float towards the outer [[cellular_structure_and_functions | cellular membrane]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

Upon reaching the outer [[cellular_structure_and_functions | cellular membrane]], the vesicle can merge with it, as both are composed of similar material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. This merging allows the protein to either exit the cell or embed itself within the outer [[cellular_structure_and_functions | cellular membrane]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. The outer [[cellular_structure_and_functions | cellular membrane]] is described as having two layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.

## Relation to Other Structures

*   **Cell Wall**: In non-animal cells, such as plants, a cell wall exists outside the [[cellular_structure_and_functions | cellular membrane]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. This cell wall provides additional strength and rigidity to the outer membrane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>.
*   **Organelles**: An [[organelle_functions_such_as_ribosomes_endoplasmic_reticulum_and_golgi_bodies | organelle]] is defined as a membrane-bound subunit of a cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. For example, a vacuole is a general term for a large membrane-bound [[organelle_functions_such_as_ribosomes_endoplasmic_reticulum_and_golgi_bodies | organelle]] that stores substances within cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.
*   **Nucleolus**: The nucleolus, located within the nucleus, is not membrane-bound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a> and is therefore not considered an [[organelle_functions_such_as_ribosomes_endoplasmic_reticulum_and_golgi_bodies | organelle]] within an [[organelle_functions_such_as_ribosomes_endoplasmic_reticulum_and_golgi_bodies | organelle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

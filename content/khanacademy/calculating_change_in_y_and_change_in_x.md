When analyzing a line on a [[Graphing equations | graph]], the *[[understanding_slope_as_rate_of_change | slope]]* indicates how steep the line is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The fundamental way to define [[understanding_slope_as_rate_of_change | slope]] is as the ratio of the change in the y-coordinate to the change in the x-coordinate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This ratio remains constant for any given line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Slope Formula

The formula for [[understanding_slope_as_rate_of_change | slope]] is:
`Slope = Change in y / Change in x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>

This can also be expressed using the Greek letter delta (Δ), which signifies "change in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>:
`Slope = Δy / Δx` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>

## Calculating Change in Y and Change in X from a Graph

To find the [[understanding_slope_as_rate_of_change | slope]] using a [[Graphing equations | graph]], you can select any two distinct points on the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. It is often easiest to choose points that have integer coordinates to simplify reading the values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

### Steps for [[graph_interpretation_for_slope_calculation | Graph Interpretation for Slope Calculation]]

1.  **Select Two Points:** Choose a starting point and an ending point on the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
2.  **Calculate Change in X (Δx):** Determine the horizontal distance between the two points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
    *   Count the units moved horizontally from the x-coordinate of the starting point to the x-coordinate of the ending point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
    *   Movement to the right is a positive change in x (e.g., from -3 to 0, Δx = 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
    *   Movement to the left is a negative change in x (e.g., from 3 to -3, Δx = -6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
3.  **Calculate Change in Y (Δy):** Determine the vertical distance between the two points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
    *   Count the units moved vertically from the y-coordinate of the starting point to the y-coordinate of the ending point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
    *   Movement upwards is a positive change in y (e.g., from -3 to -1, Δy = 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
    *   Movement downwards is a negative change in y (e.g., from 1 to -3, Δy = -4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
4.  **Calculate Slope:** Divide the change in y by the change in x (`Δy / Δx`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

### Example Walkthroughs

**Example 1:**
Starting point: (-3, -3)
Ending point: (0, -1)
*   **Change in X (Δx):** From -3 to 0, Δx = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   **Change in Y (Δy):** From -3 to -1, Δy = 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Slope:** `2 / 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

**Example 2 (using different points and direction):**
Starting point: (3, 1)
Ending point: (-3, -3)
*   **Change in Y (Δy):** From 1 to -3, Δy = -4 (moved down 4 units) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **Change in X (Δx):** From 3 to -3, Δx = -6 (moved left 6 units) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Slope:** `Δy / Δx = -4 / -6 = 2 / 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

Regardless of which two points are chosen on the line, or the direction in which you move between them, the calculated [[understanding_slope_as_rate_of_change | slope]] will always be the same, provided consistency is maintained in defining the start and end points for both x and y changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

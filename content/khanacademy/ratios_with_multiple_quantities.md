Ratios are expressions that compare quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. They tell you how much of one thing there is for a certain amount of another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## [[introduction_to_ratios | Expressing Ratios]]

Ratios can be written in several ways:
*   Using a colon (e.g., 10:5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>
*   As a fraction (e.g., 10/5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>
*   Using the word "to" (e.g., 10 to 5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>

All these forms convey the same comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The order of the quantities matters: the item written first or on top corresponds to the first number in the ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

### Example: Horses to Dogs
If you have 10 horses and 5 dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>:
*   The ratio of horses to dogs is 10:5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   This can also be written as 10/5 or 10 to 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

### Example: Dogs to Horses
If the question is the ratio of dogs to horses, the order of the numbers switches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>:
*   The ratio of dogs to horses is 5:10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

## [[reducing_ratios | Reducing Ratios]]

Ratios can often be simplified to their "reduced form" or "simplest form" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This is done by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numbers in the ratio and dividing each number by it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### Example: Horses and Dogs (Reduced)
Using the previous example of 10 horses and 5 dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>:
*   The ratio of horses to dogs is 10:5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   The greatest common divisor of 10 and 5 is 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   Divide both numbers by 5: 10 ÷ 5 = 2 and 5 ÷ 5 = 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   The reduced ratio is 2:1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
    *   This means for every 2 horses, there is 1 dog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

For the ratio of dogs to horses (5:10) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>:
*   Dividing both by 5 gives 1:2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
    *   This means for every 1 dog, there are 2 horses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## Ratios with Three or More Quantities

Ratios can compare more than two quantities. The same principles of order and reduction apply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

### Example: Apples, Oranges, and Strawberries
Suppose you have 20 apples, 40 oranges, and 60 strawberries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   The ratio of apples to oranges to strawberries is 20:40:60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   To reduce this ratio, find the largest number that divides into all three quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   The largest number that divides into 20, 40, and 60 is 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   Divide each number by 20: 20 ÷ 20 = 1, 40 ÷ 20 = 2, 60 ÷ 20 = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   The reduced ratio is 1:2:3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
    *   This means for every 1 apple, there are 2 oranges and 3 strawberries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Order of Quantities in Multi-Item Ratios
Just as with two quantities, the order matters.
*   Ratio of apples:oranges:strawberries is 1:2:3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
*   Ratio of strawberries:oranges:apples is 3:2:1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
The ratio will always be in the same order as the items are requested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

## [[using_ratios_to_solve_problems | Solving Problems with Ratios and Totals]]

Ratios can be used to determine individual quantities when a total quantity is known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

### Example: Boys and Girls in a Classroom
If the ratio of boys to girls in a classroom is 2:3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, and there are 40 students total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>, to find out how many girls there are:

1.  **Understand the "group" size**: The ratio 2:3 means for every 2 boys, there are 3 girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. This implies that for every group of students, there are 2 + 3 = 5 students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. In each group of 5 students, there are 2 boys and 3 girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
2.  **Calculate the number of groups**: Divide the total number of students by the number of students per group: 40 students ÷ 5 students/group = 8 groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
3.  **Find the specific quantity**: Since each group has 3 girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>, and there are 8 groups, multiply: 8 groups × 3 girls/group = 24 girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
    *   Similarly, for boys: 8 groups × 2 boys/group = 16 boys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
    *   (Check: 24 girls + 16 boys = 40 students total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>).

### Example: Sheep, Chickens, and Pigs on a Farm
If the ratio of sheep to chickens to pigs is 2:5:10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, and there are a total of 51 animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>, to find out how many chickens there are:

1.  **Understand the "group" size**: Add the numbers in the ratio: 2 + 5 + 10 = 17 animals per group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. In each group of 17 animals, there are 2 sheep, 5 chickens, and 10 pigs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.
2.  **Calculate the number of groups**: Divide the total number of animals by the number of animals per group: 51 animals ÷ 17 animals/group = 3 groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.
3.  **Find the specific quantity**: Each group has 5 chickens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. Multiply the number of groups by the chickens per group: 3 groups × 5 chickens/group = 15 chickens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.

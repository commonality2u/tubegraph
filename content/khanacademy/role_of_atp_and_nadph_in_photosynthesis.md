[[Photosynthesis Equation and Process | Photosynthesis]] is a crucial biological process that enables plants, bacteria, and algae to convert carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight into sugars or carbohydrates and oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This process is fundamental for life on Earth, providing the carbohydrates necessary to fuel living organisms and the oxygen required for respiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

[[Photosynthesis Equation and Process | Photosynthesis]] can be broadly divided into two main stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>:

*   [[Lightdependent and Lightindependent Reactions | Light-dependent reactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>
*   Light-independent reactions (also known as "dark reactions" or the [[Calvin Cycle and Carbohydrate Production | Calvin Cycle]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>

## Light-Dependent Reactions: Production of ATP and NADPH

The [[Lightdependent and Lightindependent Reactions | light-dependent reactions]] are named because they require photons (sunlight) to occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. In this stage, plants harness sunlight energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Photons excite electrons in chlorophyll, leading to a high-energy state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. As these electrons move to a lower energy state, their energy is captured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

The key outputs of the [[Lightdependent and Lightindependent Reactions | light-dependent reactions]] are:
*   **Oxygen**: Produced from water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
*   **[[Role of ATP in glycolysis | ATP]]**: This molecule is the cellular or biological currency of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   **NADPH**: This molecule is very similar to [[nad_reduction_to_nadh_during_glycolysis | NADH]], which is seen in cellular respiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

## Role of ATP and NADPH in the Calvin Cycle

[[Role of ATP in glycolysis | ATP]] and NADPH are essential for the subsequent light-independent reactions, specifically the [[Calvin Cycle and Carbohydrate Production | Calvin Cycle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. While these reactions occur in the light, they do not directly require photons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Instead, they depend on the energy byproducts ([[Role of ATP in glycolysis | ATP]] and NADPH) generated during the [[Lightdependent and Lightindependent Reactions | light-dependent reactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

### ATP as Energy Currency
[[Role of ATP in glycolysis | ATP]] provides the direct energy needed to power the various steps within the [[Calvin Cycle and Carbohydrate Production | Calvin Cycle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. In a similar way that [[Role of ATP in cellular respiration | ATP]] fuels cellular processes in animals, the [[Role of ATP in cellular respiration | ATP]] produced in photosynthesis powers the synthesis of carbohydrates.

### NADPH as a Reducing Agent
NADPH acts as a reducing agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. It is capable of donating a hydrogen atom along with its associated electron to other molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. When NADPH gives away its hydrogen and electron, it becomes oxidized (loses an electron), while the molecule that gains the electron is reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

The energy released when the electron associated with the hydrogen goes from NADPH to another molecule and moves to a lower energy state is harnessed in the [[Calvin Cycle and Carbohydrate Production | dark reactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. This is analogous to how [[role_of_nadh_and_fadh2_in_electron_transport_chain | NADH]] aids in [[Role of ATP in cellular respiration | ATP]] production through the [[role_of_nadh_and_fadh2_in_electron_transport_chain | electron transport chain]] in cellular respiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

In summary, the [[Calvin Cycle and Carbohydrate Production | Calvin Cycle]] takes in carbon dioxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>, along with the [[Role of ATP in glycolysis | ATP]] and NADPH from the [[Lightdependent and Lightindependent Reactions | light reactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>, to produce phosphoglyceraldehyde (PGAL) or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. This G3P molecule is a fundamental building block that can then be used to synthesize other carbohydrates, such as glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

A [[logarithm]] is the inverse of taking the exponent of something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The word "logarithm" is often shortened to "log" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. [[Logarithms are a simple idea, but they can get confusing because they are the inverse of exponentiation, which is sometimes itself a confusing concept.|Logarithms are a simple idea, but they can get confusing because they're the inverse of exponentiation, which is sometimes itself, a confusing concept]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## Understanding the Relationship

To understand a logarithm, consider an exponential expression such as 2 to the third power, which equals 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
In logarithmic form, this relationship is written as:
`log base 2 of 8 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>

This expression asks: "2 to what power is equal to 8?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a> The answer to a [[evaluating_logarithmic_expressions | logarithm expression]] is the exponent to which the base must be raised to get the given number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. In this case, 2 raised to the 3rd power (2³) equals 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Calculation Examples

### Example 1: `log base 4 of 64`
To evaluate `log base 4 of 64`, we ask: "4 to what power is equal to 64?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>
We know that 4 to the third power (4³) is 64 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
Therefore, `log base 4 of 64 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

### Example 2: `log base 10 of 1,000,000`
This asks: "10 to what power is equal to 1,000,000?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>
A power of 10 results in 1 followed by the number of zeros equal to the exponent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Since 1,000,000 has six zeros, it is 10 to the sixth power (10⁶) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
Thus, `log base 10 of 1,000,000 = 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. The 6 is the exponent you raise 10 to to get 1,000,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

### Example 3: `log base 1/2 of 1/8`
This logarithm asks: "(1/2) to what power is equal to 1/8?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>
We know that (1/2) to the third power is 1/8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
So, `log base 1/2 of 1/8 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

### Example 4: `log base x of 27 = 3` (Solving for the base)
This expression means: "x to the third power is equal to 27" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
To find x, we need to find the cubed root of 27 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
The number that, when multiplied by itself three times, equals 27 is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
So, `x = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, and the complete expression is `log base 3 of 27 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

### Example 5: `log base 100 of 1`
This asks: "100 to what power is equal to 1?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>
From [[Relationship between exponents and logarithms | exponent rules]], any non-zero number raised to the 0th power is equal to 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
Therefore, `100 to the 0 power = 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
So, `log base 100 of 1 = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

### Example 6: `log base 2 of 0` (Undefined Logarithm)
This asks: "2 to some power x is equal to 0" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
There is no real number that you can raise 2 to the power of to get 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
Thus, `log base 2 of 0` is [[undefined_logarithms_and_constraints | undefined]] or has no solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

### Example 7: `log base 3 of -1` (Undefined Logarithm)
This asks: "3 to what power is equal to -1?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>
Assuming we are dealing with real numbers, there is no number you can raise 3 to the power of to get a negative number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
Therefore, `log base 3 of -1` is [[undefined_logarithms_and_constraints | undefined]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
For a logarithm to be defined, if the base is positive, the number it operates on must be greater than 0 (not equal to 0 and not negative) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

### Example 8: `log base 8 of 1/64` (Negative Exponents)
This asks: "8 to what power equals 1/64?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>
We know that 8 squared (8²) is 64 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. To get the reciprocal (1/64), we use a [[negative_exponents_in_logarithms | negative exponent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
From the [[negative_exponents_in_logarithms | negative exponent module]], 8 to the negative 2 power (8⁻²) is the same as 1 divided by 8 to the 2nd power (1/8²), which equals 1/64 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
So, `log base 8 of 1/64 = -2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
When you take the inverse of the number you are taking the logarithm of, the answer becomes negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

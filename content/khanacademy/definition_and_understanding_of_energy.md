[[concept_of_work_in_physics|Work]] and energy are fundamental concepts in physics, though they are often used in everyday language with a slightly different meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. While their definitions can seem circular, a deeper understanding emerges through mathematical relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Basic Definitions

In physics, [[concept_of_work_in_physics|work]] is defined as energy transferred by a force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Conversely, energy is defined as the ability to do [[concept_of_work_in_physics|work]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. These definitions highlight their interconnected nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Units of Energy

The standard unit for both [[concept_of_work_in_physics|work]] and energy is the Joule (J) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. One Joule is equivalent to one Newton-meter (Nm) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## Kinetic Energy

One important form of energy is kinetic energy, which is the energy an object possesses due to its motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. It can also be understood as the [[concept_of_work_in_physics|work]] required to accelerate an object from rest to its current velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

### Derivation of Kinetic Energy Formula

To understand kinetic energy quantitatively, consider a block of mass ($m$) starting at rest (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?v_i = 0" title="v_i = 0" />) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. A force ($F$) is applied to this block over a distance ($d$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

The [[concept_of_work_in_physics|work]] done on the block is given by:
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?Work = F \times d" title="Work = F \times d" /> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>

From kinematics, the final velocity (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?v_f" title="v_f" />) of an object undergoing constant acceleration over a distance is related by the equation:
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2ad" title="v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2ad" /> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>

Since the block starts at rest (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?v_i = 0" title="v_i = 0" />) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>:
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?v_f^2 = 2ad" title="v_f^2 = 2ad" /> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>

According to Newton's Second Law, force equals mass times acceleration ($F = ma$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Therefore, acceleration ($a$) can be expressed as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?a = F/m" title="a = F/m" /> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

Substituting the expression for acceleration into the kinematics equation:
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?v_f^2 = 2 \left(\frac{F}{m}\right) d" title="v_f^2 = 2 \left(\frac{F}{m}\right) d" /> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>

Rearranging the terms to isolate <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?F \times d" title="F \times d" />:
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?m v_f^2 = 2 (F \times d)" title="m v_f^2 = 2 (F \times d)" /> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>

Since <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?F \times d" title="F \times d" /> is equal to [[concept_of_work_in_physics|work]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>:
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?m v_f^2 = 2 \times Work" title="m v_f^2 = 2 \times Work" /> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>

Solving for [[concept_of_work_in_physics|work]]:
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?Work = \frac{1}{2} m v_f^2" title="Work = \frac{1}{2} m v_f^2" /> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>

This equation represents the [[concept_of_work_in_physics|work]] inputted into the object to bring it to a certain velocity, which is by definition its kinetic energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Thus, the formula for kinetic energy (KE) is:
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?KE = \frac{1}{2} mv^2" title="KE = \frac{1}{2} mv^2" /> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>

This formula is very common and represents one fundamental form of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. Future discussions will introduce other forms of energy and the [[law_of_conservation_of_energy|Law of Conservation of Energy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

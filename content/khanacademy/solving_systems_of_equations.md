To find an x and y value that satisfies two equations, graphically this represents the intersection of the lines that denote the solution sets for both equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Elimination Method

The elimination method aims to eliminate one of the variables, similar to [[solving_linear_systems_by_substitution | substitution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This is done by adding or subtracting the equations. When dealing with an equation, you must always add or subtract the same thing to both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

Consider the following [[systems_of_equations | system of equations]]:
1.  `3x + 4y = 2.5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>
2.  `5x - 4y = 25.5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>

By observing the equations, notice that the `y` terms have opposite coefficients (`+4y` and `-4y`). If these two equations are added together, the `y` terms will cancel out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This is valid because `5x - 4y` is equal to `25.5`, so adding `5x - 4y` to the left side of the first equation and `25.5` to its right side is essentially adding the same value to both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

Adding the two equations:
`(3x + 4y) + (5x - 4y) = 2.5 + 25.5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>
`8x + 0y = 28` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>
`8x = 28` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>

Now, [[solving_simple_linear_equations | solve for x]]:
`x = 28 / 8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>
`x = 7/2` (by dividing numerator and denominator by 4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>

### Solving for the Second Variable

Substitute the value of x (7/2) back into either original equation to [[solving_equations_with_variables | solve for y]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Using the first equation:
`3(7/2) + 4y = 2.5` (or 5/2 as a fraction) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>
`21/2 + 4y = 5/2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>

Subtract `21/2` from both sides:
`4y = 5/2 - 21/2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>
`4y = -16/2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>
`4y = -8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>

[[solving_simple_linear_equations | Solve for y]]:
`y = -8 / 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>
`y = -2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>

The solution to the system is `x = 7/2` and `y = -2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. This represents the coordinate of the intersection of the two lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

The elimination method is also useful for [[word_problems_involving_systems_of_equations | word problems involving systems of equations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

### Example Problem: Candy Store Purchase

**Problem:** Nadia buys 3 candy bars and 4 Fruit Roll-Ups for $2.84. Peter buys 3 candy bars and 1 Fruit Roll-Up for $1.79. What is the cost of each candy bar and each Fruit Roll-Up? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>

**1. Define Variables:**
Let `x` = cost of a candy bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>
Let `y` = cost of a Fruit Roll-Up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>

**2. Translate to Equations:**
Nadia's purchase: `3x + 4y = 2.84` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>
Peter's purchase: `3x + 1y = 1.79` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>

**3. Use Elimination to Solve:**
Notice that both equations have `3x`. To eliminate `x`, subtract the second equation from the first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. Subtracting `(3x + y)` from the left side and `$1.79` from the right side is valid because `3x + y` equals `$1.79` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

Alternatively, multiply the second equation by -1 and then add it to the first equation:
`-1 * (3x + y) = -1 * (1.79)`
`-3x - y = -1.79` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>

Now, add this modified second equation to the first:
`(3x + 4y) + (-3x - y) = 2.84 + (-1.79)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>
`0x + 3y = 1.05` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>
`3y = 1.05` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>

**4. Solve for `y`:**
`y = 1.05 / 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>
`y = 0.35` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>
So, the cost of a Fruit Roll-Up is $0.35 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

**5. Solve for `x`:**
Substitute `y = 0.35` into either original equation. Using Peter's equation:
`3x + 0.35 = 1.79` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>

[[solving_equations_with_variables_on_both_sides | Subtract 0.35 from both sides]]:
`3x = 1.79 - 0.35` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>
`3x = 1.44` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>

[[solving_simple_linear_equations | Solve for x]]:
`x = 1.44 / 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>
`x = 0.48` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>
So, the cost of a candy bar is $0.48 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

**Answer:** The cost of a candy bar is $0.48, and the cost of a Fruit Roll-Up is $0.35 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

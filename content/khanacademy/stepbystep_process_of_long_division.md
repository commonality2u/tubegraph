To perform [[long_division_with_larger_numbers | long division]] effectively, a foundational understanding of [[basic_multiplication_concepts | multiplication tables]] is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. It is generally recommended to know multiplication tables from 1x1 up to at least 10x10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, or even 12x12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This knowledge allows for quick recall when performing division problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## Basic Division Using Multiplication Tables

For simple division problems, the process involves thinking about the inverse operation:
*   To divide 25 by 5, think: "5 times what equals 25?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Since 5 x 5 = 25, then 25 divided by 5 is 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The 5 is written in the ones place, mindful of place notation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   Similarly, for 49 divided by 7, consider: "7 times what equals 49?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. As 7 x 7 = 49, the answer is 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   To divide 54 by 9, ask: "9 times what equals 54?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. By recalling or incrementally calculating (e.g., 9x5=45, 9x6=54), the answer is 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## [[handling_remainders_in_division | Handling Remainders]]

Not all division problems result in a whole number. When a number does not divide cleanly, there will be a remainder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

To divide 23 by 3:
1.  List multiples of 3: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24... <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
2.  Find the largest multiple of 3 that is less than or equal to 23. This is 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
3.  Determine how many times 3 goes into 21: 3 x 7 = 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
4.  Subtract this multiple from the original number: 23 - 21 = 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This difference is the remainder.
5.  So, 23 divided by 3 is 7 with a remainder of 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## [[using_long_division_with_multidigit_numbers | Step-by-Step Long Division]] for Larger Numbers

For dividing into larger numbers, a systematic approach is used. Let's use the example of dividing 344 by 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

1.  **Divide the first digit**: Start by seeing how many times the divisor (4) goes into the first digit of the dividend (3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Since 4 goes into 3 zero times, move to the next digit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

2.  **Consider the first two digits**: Now, determine how many times 4 goes into 34 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
    *   Recall multiplication tables: 4 x 8 = 32, and 4 x 9 = 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
    *   Since 36 is greater than 34, 4 goes into 34 eight times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
    *   Write the '8' directly above the '4' in 344 (in the tens place) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

3.  **Multiply the quotient by the divisor**: Multiply the 8 (from the quotient) by 4 (the divisor): 8 x 4 = 32 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
    *   Write '32' directly below '34' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

4.  **Subtract**: Subtract 32 from 34: 34 - 32 = 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
    *   This '2' represents 2 tens, or 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

5.  **Bring down the next digit**: Bring down the next digit from the dividend (the '4' from 344) next to the remainder '2', forming '24' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

6.  **Repeat the process**: Now, determine how many times 4 goes into 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
    *   From multiplication tables, 4 x 6 = 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
    *   Write the '6' next to the '8' in the quotient (in the ones place) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

7.  **Multiply**: Multiply 6 by 4: 6 x 4 = 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
    *   Write '24' below the '24' you formed in step 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

8.  **Subtract**: Subtract 24 from 24: 24 - 24 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
    *   Since the remainder is 0 and there are no more digits to bring down, the division is complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

Therefore, 344 divided by 4 is exactly 86 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

### Additional Examples

#### Example 1: 91 divided by 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>

1.  7 goes into 9 one time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. Write '1' above the '9'.
2.  1 times 7 is 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Write '7' below '9'.
3.  Subtract: 9 minus 7 is 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
4.  Bring down the '1' to make 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
5.  7 goes into 21 three times (since 7 x 3 = 21) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. Write '3' next to the '1' in the quotient.
6.  3 times 7 is 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. Write '21' below '21'.
7.  Subtract: 21 minus 21 is 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
Thus, 91 divided by 7 is 13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

#### Example 2: 608 divided by 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>

1.  8 goes into 6 zero times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Move to the next digit.
2.  8 goes into 60 how many times? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>
    *   8 x 7 = 56 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
    *   8 x 8 = 64 (too big) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
    *   So, 8 goes into 60 seven times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. Write '7' above the '0' in 608.
3.  7 times 8 is 56 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. Write '56' below '60'.
4.  Subtract: 60 minus 56 is 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
5.  Bring down the '8' to make 48 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
6.  8 goes into 48 how many times? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>
    *   8 x 6 = 48 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
    *   So, 8 goes into 48 six times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. Write '6' next to the '7' in the quotient.
7.  6 times 8 is 48 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. Write '48' below '48'.
8.  Subtract: 48 minus 48 is 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
Thus, 608 divided by 8 is 76 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

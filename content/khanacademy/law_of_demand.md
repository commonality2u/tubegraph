The **Law of Demand** is a core idea in microeconomics, stating that if the price of a product increases, the [[effects_of_price_changes_on_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] for that product will decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Conversely, if the price of a product decreases, the [[effects_of_price_changes_on_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] will increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. While this is a general principle, there are some exceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Demand vs. Quantity Demanded

It is crucial in economics to distinguish between "demand" and "[[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>:
*   **Quantity Demanded**: Refers to a specific amount of a product that people are willing to buy at a given price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Changes in price lead to changes in [[effects_of_price_changes_on_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Demand**: Refers to the entire relationship between various prices and the corresponding [[effects_of_price_changes_on_quantity_demanded | quantities demanded]], assuming [[Ceteris paribus assumption | all else is equal]] (*ceteris paribus*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. This entire relationship can be represented by a [[demand_schedule_and_demand_curve | demand schedule]] or a [[demand_schedule_and_demand_curve | demand curve]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

When only the price changes (and [[Ceteris paribus assumption | everything else is held equal]]), it causes a change in the [[effects_of_price_changes_on_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]], which is observed as a movement *along* the existing [[demand_schedule_and_demand_curve | demand curve]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. If other factors besides price change, the entire "demand" (the relationship itself) changes, resulting in a shift of the [[demand_schedule_and_demand_curve | demand curve]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

## Demand Schedule

A [[demand_schedule_and_demand_curve | demand schedule]] is a table that illustrates the relationship between the price of a product and its [[effects_of_price_changes_on_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]], assuming [[Ceteris paribus assumption | all other factors are constant]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

**Example: "Space Whatever" Ebook Demand Schedule** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>

| Scenario | Price ($) | Quantity Demanded (Units) |
| :------- | :-------- | :------------------------ |
| A        | 2         | 60,000                    |
| B        | 4         | 40,000                    |
| C        | 6         | 30,000                    |
| D        | 8         | 25,000                    |
| E        | 10        | 23,000                    |

This table clearly demonstrates the law of demand: as the price increases, the [[effects_of_price_changes_on_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

## Demand Curve

A [[demand_schedule_and_demand_curve | demand curve]] is a graphical representation of the [[demand_schedule_and_demand_curve | demand schedule]], showing the continuous relationship between price and [[effects_of_price_changes_on_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. In economics, the convention is to plot price on the vertical (y) axis and [[effects_of_price_changes_on_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] on the horizontal (x) axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

            Price ($)
     10 +-------------------- E (10, 23,000)
        |           .
      8 +----------D (.8, 25,000)
        |           .
      6 +---------C (.6, 30,000)
        |           .

The points from the demand schedule are plotted (e.g., Scenario A: $2, 60,000 units), and a continuous line is drawn to represent the demand curve, indicating that prices and quantities in between the listed scenarios are also possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. This downward-sloping curve visually confirms the inverse relationship between price and [[effects_of_price_changes_on_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] described by the law of demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

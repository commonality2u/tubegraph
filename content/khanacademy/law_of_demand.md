The law of demand is one of the core ideas of microeconomics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. It is an intuitive concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

The law of demand states that:
*   If the price of a product increases, the [[impact_of_price_changes_on_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] for that product will decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
*   Conversely, if the price of a product decreases, the [[impact_of_price_changes_on_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] of that product will increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

This is a general principle, though there are some exceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Demand vs. Quantity Demanded

In formal economic terms, the word "demand" does not refer to a specific quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Instead, demand describes, [[ceteris_paribus_in_economics | all else equal]], the entire relationship between price and [[impact_of_price_changes_on_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. If referring to a specific amount, it is more precise to say "[[impact_of_price_changes_on_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

The [[difference_between_demand_and_quantity_demanded | difference between demand and quantity demanded]] is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This video focuses on how the [[impact_of_price_changes_on_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded changes]] in relation to price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, while future discussions will cover how the entire relationship (demand) shifts based on other factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## Illustrating Demand: Demand Schedule and Demand Curve

To make the concept concrete, consider the example of an ebook, "Space Whatever."

### Demand Schedule

A [[demand_schedule_and_demand_curve | demand schedule]] is a table that shows the relationship between the price of a product and its [[impact_of_price_changes_on_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]], [[ceteris_paribus_in_economics | all else equal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

| Scenario | Price (USD) | Quantity Demanded (Units) |
| :------- | :---------- | :------------------------ |
| A        | $2          | 60,000                    |
| B        | $4          | 40,000                    |
| C        | $6          | 30,000                    |
| D        | $8          | 25,000                    |
| E        | $10         | 23,000                    |

This table explicitly shows the law of demand: as the price increases, the [[impact_of_price_changes_on_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

### Demand Curve

A [[demand_schedule_and_demand_curve | demand curve]] is a visual representation derived from the [[demand_schedule_and_demand_curve | demand schedule]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. It plots these price and [[impact_of_price_changes_on_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] points and connects them with a continuous curve, accounting for prices not explicitly listed in the schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

In economics, it's a convention to plot price on the vertical axis and [[impact_of_price_changes_on_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] on the horizontal axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

An example of a plotted [[graphing_the_demand_curve | demand curve]]:
*   **Scenario A:** Price $2, Quantity Demanded 60,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>
*   **Scenario B:** Price $4, Quantity Demanded 40,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>
*   **Scenario C:** Price $6, Quantity Demanded 30,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>
*   **Scenario D:** Price $8, Quantity Demanded 25,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>
*   **Scenario E:** Price $10, Quantity Demanded 23,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>

> [!NOTE]
> The demand itself refers to this entire relationship (the [[demand_schedule_and_demand_curve | demand schedule]] or the [[graphing_the_demand_curve | demand curve]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. When only the price changes and [[ceteris_paribus_in_economics | everything else is held equal]], it is the [[impact_of_price_changes_on_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] that changes, representing a movement *along* the existing demand curve, rather than a shift *of* the demand curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

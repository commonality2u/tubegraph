In physics, the [[concept_of_work_in_physics | concepts of work]] and [[definition_of_energy | energy]] are closely related, though their definitions can sometimes appear circular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. While these terms are used in everyday language, their physics contexts are more specific, though not entirely unrelated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Defining Work and Energy

From a physics perspective:
*   [[concept_of_work_in_physics | Work]] is defined as [[definition_of_energy | energy]] transferred by a force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   [[definition_of_energy | Energy]] is defined as the ability to do [[concept_of_work_in_physics | work]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

This reciprocal definition highlights their intrinsic relationship and suggests they are fundamental concepts used to understand motion, force, and their effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. To gain a more [[understanding_mathematical_equations | quantitative]] understanding, it's essential to look at their [[mathematical_representation_of_work | mathematical representations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41">[01:41]</a>.

## Mathematical Representation of Work

In mechanics, the [[mathematical_representation_of_work | definition of work]] is expressed as:
$$
\text{Work} = \text{Force} \times \text{distance}
$$
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47">[01:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55">[01:55]</a>

For example, if a force of 10 Newtons is applied to move a block 7 meters, the [[concept_of_work_in_physics | work]] done is 70 Newton meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07">[02:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27">[02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42">[02:42]</a>.

### Units of Work and Energy
The unit for [[concept_of_work_in_physics | work]] is the Newton meter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51">[02:51]</a>. This unit is also defined as one [[definition_of_energy | joule]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00">[03:00]</a>. Notably, the [[definition_of_energy | joule]] is the unit for both [[concept_of_work_in_physics | work]] and [[definition_of_energy | energy]], indicating their interchangeability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08">[03:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10">[03:10]</a>.

## Work and Kinetic Energy

When a force is applied to an object over a distance, it performs [[concept_of_work_in_physics | work]] and transfers [[definition_of_energy | energy]] to that object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30">[03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34">[03:34]</a>. If an object starts at rest and is accelerated by a force, its final [[understanding_speed_and_velocity | velocity]] can be determined using [[understanding_mathematical_equations | kinematics equations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52">[04:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06">[05:06]</a>.

The relevant kinematic equation states that the final [[understanding_speed_and_velocity | velocity]] squared ($v_f^2$) is equal to the initial [[understanding_speed_and_velocity | velocity]] squared ($v_i^2$) plus 2 times the acceleration ($a$) times the distance ($d$):
$$
v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2ad
$$
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23">[05:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31">[05:31]</a>

If an object starts at rest ($v_i = 0$), the equation simplifies to:
$$
v_f^2 = 2ad
$$
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38">[05:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44">[05:44]</a>

Since force ($F$) equals mass ($m$) times acceleration ($a$) ($F = ma$), acceleration can be expressed as $a = F/m$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03">[06:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07">[06:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12">[06:12]</a>. Substituting this into the equation:
$$
v_f^2 = 2 \left(\frac{F}{m}\right) d
$$
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12">[06:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18">[06:18]</a>

Rearranging the terms, and recalling that [[concept_of_work_in_physics | work]] is $F \times d$:
$$
v_f^2 = 2 \frac{(Fd)}{m} \implies v_f^2 = 2 \frac{\text{Work}}{m}
$$
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52">[06:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12">[07:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22">[07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27">[07:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33">[07:33]</a>

Multiplying both sides by $m$ and dividing by 2 yields the formula for [[calculating_kinetic_energy | work]] in terms of mass and [[understanding_speed_and_velocity | velocity]]:
$$
\text{Work} = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
$$
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37">[07:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58">[07:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03">[08:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05">[08:05]</a>

### Kinetic Energy
This derived formula represents [[calculating_kinetic_energy | kinetic energy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26">[08:26]</a>. [[calculating_kinetic_energy | Kinetic energy]] is the [[definition_of_energy | energy]] an object possesses due to its motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32">[08:32]</a>. It is also understood as the [[concept_of_work_in_physics | work]] needed to accelerate an object from being stationary to its current [[understanding_speed_and_velocity | velocity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35">[08:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41">[08:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43">[08:43]</a>.

The formula for [[calculating_kinetic_energy | kinetic energy]] is a very common one:
$$
KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
$$
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48">[08:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51">[08:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53">[08:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55">[08:55]</a>

This demonstrates that [[calculating_kinetic_energy | kinetic energy]] is a specific form of [[definition_of_energy | energy]] that results directly from [[concept_of_work_in_physics | work]] done on an object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59">[08:59]</a>. The relationship between [[concept_of_work_in_physics | work]] and [[definition_of_energy | energy]] is further explored by considering other forms of [[definition_of_energy | energy]] and the [[definition_of_energy | law of conservation of energy]], which shows how one form of [[definition_of_energy | energy]] can be converted into another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02">[09:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04">[09:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05">[09:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07">[09:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11">[09:11]</a>.

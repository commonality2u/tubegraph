Statistics is a way to understand or get a grasp on [[data]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. When describing a set of data, descriptive statistics aims to represent all the data with a smaller set of numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This often involves finding a "typical" or "middle" number, also known as a [[mean_median_and_mode | measure of central tendency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## What is the Mode?

The mode is one of three main [[mean_median_and_mode | measures of central tendency]] used in statistics, alongside the arithmetic mean and the [[Median | median]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. While it may sound complex, it is a straightforward concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a> and is considered the most basic idea among the measures of central tendency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

The mode is defined as the most common number in a data set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

## Finding the Mode

To find the mode, one identifies the number that appears most frequently within a given data set.

> [!NOTE] When does a mode exist?
> A mode exists if there is a single most common number in the data set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. If all numbers in the data set are represented equally, meaning there isn't one single most common number, then there is no mode for that data set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

### Example: Plant Heights Data Set

Consider a data set representing the heights of six plants in a garden (in inches): 4, 3, 1, 6, 1, 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

To [[finding_the_mode | find the mode]] in this data set:
*   The number 4 appears once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   The number 3 appears once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   The number 1 appears twice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
*   The number 6 appears once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   The number 7 appears once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

The number that shows up the most times in this data set is 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
Therefore, the mode for this data set is 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

## Purpose of the Mode

The mode, like the arithmetic mean and the [[Median | median]], is a way of trying to identify a typical, middle, or central tendency within a data set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. It can be particularly useful in situations where one number appears significantly more frequently than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

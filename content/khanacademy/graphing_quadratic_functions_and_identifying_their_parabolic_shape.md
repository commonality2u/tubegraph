Quadratic functions are defined by an equation where the highest power of the variable is two, typically in the form `ax² + bx + c` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. When plotted, a quadratic function forms a U-shaped curve known as a parabola <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Parabolic Shape and Orientation
The shape of a quadratic function's graph is always a parabola <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Parabolas can open either upwards or downwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. For the function `f(x) = 3x² + 6x - 2`, the parabola opens upwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## The Vertex
A key feature of a parabola is its **vertex**.
*   For an upward-opening parabola, the vertex represents the minimum point of the function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
*   For a downward-opening parabola, it represents the maximum point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

The y-value of the vertex is crucial for understanding the function's [[understanding_the_range_of_a_quadratic_function | range]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

### Calculating the Vertex
The x-coordinate of the vertex can be found using the formula `-b / 2a` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This formula is derived from the [[introduction_to_the_quadratic_formula | quadratic formula]], which itself comes from completing the square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

For `f(x) = 3x² + 6x - 2`:
*   `a = 3`, `b = 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>
*   x-coordinate of the vertex = `-6 / (2 * 3) = -6 / 6 = -1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>
*   To find the y-coordinate, substitute x = -1 into the function:
    `f(-1) = 3(-1)² + 6(-1) - 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>
    `f(-1) = 3(1) - 6 - 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>
    `f(-1) = 3 - 6 - 2 = -3 - 2 = -5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>
*   Thus, the vertex of this parabola is at `(-1, -5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Graphing the Function
To [[graphing_equations | graph]] a quadratic function and visualize its parabolic shape, one can plot several points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### Plotting Points
For `f(x) = 3x² + 6x - 2`:
*   When x = -2: `f(-2) = 3(-2)² + 6(-2) - 2 = 3(4) - 12 - 2 = 12 - 12 - 2 = -2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Point: `(-2, -2)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   When x = -1 (the vertex): `f(-1) = -5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Point: `(-1, -5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   When x = 0: `f(0) = 3(0)² + 6(0) - 2 = -2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Point: `(0, -2)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   When x = 1: `f(1) = 3(1)² + 6(1) - 2 = 3 + 6 - 2 = 7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Point: `(1, 7)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

### [[analyzing_symmetry_in_parabolic_graphs | Symmetry]] Around the Vertex
Parabolas exhibit [[analyzing_symmetry_in_parabolic_graphs | symmetry]] around a vertical line passing through their vertex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. For example, `f(-2) = -2` and `f(0) = -2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Both x-values are one unit away from the vertex's x-value of -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. This [[analyzing_symmetry_in_parabolic_graphs | symmetry]] helps confirm the location of the vertex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

## Visualizing Domain and Range
Plotting these points and drawing the curve provides a [[graphical_representation_and_visual_understanding_of_functions | visual understanding]] of the function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

*   **Domain**: For `f(x) = 3x² + 6x - 2`, any real number can be input into the function, meaning the [[understanding_the_domain_of_a_quadratic_function | domain]] is all real numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Range**: The [[graphical_interpretation_of_quadratic_solutions | graphical interpretation]] clearly shows that the lowest y-value (output) achieved is at the vertex, which is -5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Since the parabola opens upwards, the function can take on any value greater than or equal to -5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. Therefore, the [[understanding_the_range_of_a_quadratic_function | range]] is all real numbers greater than or equal to -5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

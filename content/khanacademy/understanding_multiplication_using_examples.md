[[basics_of_multiplication | Multiplication]] is a fundamental mathematical operation. The best way to understand it is by working through examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Multiplication as Repeated Addition

Unlike addition, which combines distinct quantities (e.g., 2 apples + 3 blueberries = 5 total fruit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>), [[multiplication_as_repeated_addition | multiplication]] can be thought of as a shortcut for repeated addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

For example, to understand "2 times 3":
*   You can interpret it as adding 2 to itself three times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>:
    2 + 2 + 2 = 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
    (Here, the '3' tells you how many 2's to add <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>).
*   Alternatively, you can interpret it as adding 3 to itself two times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>:
    3 + 3 = 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
    (Here, the '2' tells you how many 3's to add <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>).

Notice that regardless of the interpretation, the answer remains the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

## Utility of Multiplication

[[importance_and_utility_of_multiplication | Multiplication]] simplifies counting, especially when dealing with organized groups of items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

Consider an arrangement of lemons in rows:
🍋🍋🍋
🍋🍋🍋
🍋🍋🍋
🍋🍋🍋

Instead of counting each lemon individually (12 lemons total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>), you can use multiplication:
1.  Count the number of lemons in each row: 3 lemons per row <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
2.  Count the number of rows: 4 rows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
3.  [[visualizing_multiplication_in_equations | Multiply]] the number of lemons per row by the number of rows: 4 times 3 lemons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

Using [[multiplication_as_repeated_addition | repeated addition]]:
*   Four 3's: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   Three 4's: 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

This method is much faster when dealing with larger numbers, like 100 lemons in 100 rows, where individual counting would be impractical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

## Special Properties of Multiplication

### Multiplying by One (Identity Property)
Any number multiplied by 1 is the number itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
*   3 times 1 means "three 1's": 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.
*   Alternatively, it means "3 one time": which is simply 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.
*   Examples:
    *   100 times 1 = 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>
    *   1 times 39 = 39 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>

### Multiplying by Zero (Zero Property)
Any number multiplied by 0 is 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.
*   4 times 0 means "zero four times": 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.
*   Alternatively, it means "4 zero times": there are no 4's to write, so the result is nothing (0) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.
*   Examples:
    *   5,493,692 times 0 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>
    *   0 times 17 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>

The nephron is the smallest functional level of the kidney, responsible for its primary operations of waste excretion and water regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Each average kidney contains approximately one million nephrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## Kidney Overview and Nephron Location
The kidneys are organs located closer to the back, on either side of the spine, behind the liver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Their main [[functions_of_the_kidney | functions]] include excreting waste, maintaining water and electrolyte levels, regulating blood pressure, and producing hormones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The nephron performs the two major [[functions_of_the_kidney | functions of the kidney]]: waste excretion and the maintenance of water level in the blood system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

When viewing a sliced kidney, two main regions are visible:
*   **Renal Cortex**: The outer part of the kidney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The term "renal" always refers to the kidney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **Renal Medulla**: The inner, middle part of the kidney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

Nephrons originate in the renal cortex and extend downwards into the renal medulla, then loop back into the cortex before draining into collecting ducts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

## Nephron Structure and Function

The nephron is a complex tubule system where [[processes_of_blood_filtration_and_waste_excretion | blood filtration and waste excretion]] occur, alongside the reabsorption of essential substances and water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

### Glomerulus and Bowman's Capsule (Filtration)
The process begins with blood flow into an arteriole known as the **afferent arteriole** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

1.  **Glomerulus**: Blood enters a highly coiled capillary network called the glomerulus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. This structure is very porous and maintains a high blood pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Blood then exits via the **efferent arteriole** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
2.  **Bowman's Capsule**: The glomerulus is surrounded by the Bowman's capsule, a sphere with an opening for the capillary network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. Specialized cells called podocytes line the Bowman's capsule, acting as a selective filter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
3.  **Filtrate Formation**: About one-fifth of the fluid entering the glomerulus is squeezed out into the **Bowman's space** within the capsule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. This resulting fluid is called **glomerular filtrate** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. The filtrate contains small ions (like sodium), small molecules (like glucose and amino acids), and water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Larger molecules like red blood cells and large proteins are not filtered out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

### Proximal Tubule (Initial Reabsorption)
The filtrate flows from the Bowman's capsule into the **proximal tubule** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. "Proximal" means near, indicating its closeness to the beginning of the nephron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. This tubule is highly convoluted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

*   **Reabsorption**: The primary purpose of the proximal tubule is to reabsorb substances the body needs back into the bloodstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. This includes glucose, sodium, amino acids, and some water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
*   **Active Transport**: This reabsorption is an active process, meaning it requires energy (ATP) to pump substances like sodium out of the filtrate and back into the surrounding capillaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

### Loop of Henle (Concentration Gradient and Water Reabsorption)
Following the proximal tubule, the filtrate enters the **loop of Henle**, which dips deeply into the renal medulla and then ascends back towards the cortex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

*   **Ascending Limb**: This part of the loop actively pumps out salts (sodium, potassium, chloride ions) into the renal medulla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. It is impermeable to water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. This active pumping creates a highly salty, hypertonic environment in the renal medulla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
*   **Descending Limb**: This part is only permeable to water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. As the filtrate descends into the salty medulla, water naturally leaves the tubule via osmosis to balance the concentrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. This is a major mechanism for [[water_and_electrolyte_reabsorption_mechanisms | water reabsorption]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>, as biological systems cannot actively pump water directly using ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. The length of the loop allows sufficient time for this water reabsorption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

### Distal Tubule (Fine-Tuning Reabsorption)
After the loop of Henle, the filtrate enters the **distal convoluted tubule** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. "Distal" means further away from the beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.

*   **Further Reabsorption**: Here, more reabsorption of substances like calcium and additional sodium occurs, along with a bit more water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. The aim is to reclaim all necessary substances from the filtrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>.

### Collecting Duct (Final Concentration and Excretion)
The processed filtrate, now more concentrated and mainly composed of waste products and excess water, enters the **collecting ducts** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. Multiple nephrons empty into a single collecting duct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

*   **Passage through Medulla**: The collecting duct extends back into the salty renal medulla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>.
*   **Hormonal Control**: Hormones like anti-diuretic hormone can increase the permeability of the collecting duct, allowing more water to leave the filtrate as it passes through the salty medulla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. This further concentrates the urine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.
*   **Urine Excretion**: Once the final concentration is achieved, the fluid, now called urine, leaves the kidney via the ureters and travels to the urinary bladder for excretion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>.

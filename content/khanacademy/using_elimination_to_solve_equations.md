[[methods_for_solving_systems_of_equations | Solving systems of equations]] involves finding an X and Y value that satisfies all equations in the system simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Graphically, this represents the intersection point of the lines for each equation's solution set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The elimination method is an [[algebraic_techniques_for_solving_equations | algebraic technique]] to solve these systems by removing one of the variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Core Principle of Elimination

The fundamental rule for [[solving_algebraic_equations | algebraic equations]] is that any operation performed on one side of an equation must also be performed on the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. When using elimination, you can add or subtract an entire equation from another, because you are effectively adding or subtracting equal values from both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. If `5x - 4y` is equal to `25.5`, then adding `5x - 4y` to the left side of another equation and `25.5` to its right side means you are adding the same quantity to both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This [[systematic_approach_to_solving_equations | systematic approach]] leads to a single equation with one variable, making it solvable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Example 1: Direct Elimination by Addition

Consider the following [[understanding_systems_of_equations | system of equations]]:
1.  `3x + 4y = 2.5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>
2.  `5x - 4y = 25.5` <a class="yt=" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>

Notice that the `y` terms, `+4y` and `-4y`, are opposites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
Adding the two equations together will eliminate the `y` variable:
`(3x + 4y) + (5x - 4y) = 2.5 + 25.5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>

This simplifies to:
`8x + 0y = 28` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>
`8x = 28` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>

Now, [[solving_simple_linear_equations | solve for x]] by [[isolating_variables_in_algebraic_equations | dividing both sides by 8]]:
`x = 28 / 8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>
`x = 7 / 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>

To find the value of `y`, substitute `x = 7/2` into either of the original equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Using the first equation:
`3 * (7/2) + 4y = 2.5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>
`21/2 + 4y = 5/2` (converting 2.5 to 5/2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>

Subtract `21/2` from both sides:
`4y = 5/2 - 21/2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>
`4y = -16/2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>
`4y = -8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>

[[solving_simple_linear_equations | Divide by 4]]:
`y = -2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>

The solution to the system is `x = 7/2` and `y = -2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. This can be verified by substituting these values into both original equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## Example 2: Elimination in a Real-Life Scenario

Let's use [[using_elimination_in_reallife_scenarios | elimination]] to solve a word problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

**Problem:** Nadia buys 3 candy bars and 4 Fruit Roll-Ups for $2.84. Peter buys 3 candy bars and 1 Fruit Roll-Up for $1.79. What is the cost of each candy bar and Fruit Roll-Up? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>

**1. Define Variables:**
Let `x` = cost of a candy bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>
Let `y` = cost of a Fruit Roll-Up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>

**2. Formulate Equations:**
From Nadia's purchase: `3x + 4y = 2.84` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>
From Peter's purchase: `3x + 1y = 1.79` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>

**3. Apply Elimination:**
Notice that both equations have a `3x` term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. We can subtract Peter's equation from Nadia's equation to eliminate `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. This is equivalent to multiplying the second equation by -1 and then adding it to the first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

Multiplying Peter's equation by -1:
`-3x - y = -1.79` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>

Now, add this modified equation to Nadia's equation:
`(3x + 4y) + (-3x - y) = 2.84 + (-1.79)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>

This simplifies to:
`0x + 3y = 1.05` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>
`3y = 1.05` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>

**4. Solve for the First Variable:**
[[solving_simple_linear_equations | Divide both sides by 3]] to [[isolating_variables_in_algebraic_equations | isolate y]]:
`y = 1.05 / 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>
`y = 0.35` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>

So, the cost of a Fruit Roll-Up is $0.35 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

**5. Solve for the Second Variable:**
Substitute `y = 0.35` into Peter's original equation (which was `3x + y = 1.79`):
`3x + 0.35 = 1.79` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>

[[isolating_variables_in_algebraic_equations | Subtract 0.35 from both sides]]:
`3x = 1.79 - 0.35` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>
`3x = 1.44` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>

[[solving_simple_linear_equations | Divide by 3]]:
`x = 1.44 / 3`
`x = 0.48` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>

Therefore, the cost of a candy bar is $0.48, and the cost of a Fruit Roll-Up is $0.35 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

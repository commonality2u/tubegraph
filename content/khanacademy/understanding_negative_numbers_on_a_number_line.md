When first encountered, [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negative numbers]] might seem deep and mysterious, especially since initial counting focuses on positive numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. However, it's likely that you've already encountered [[reallife_examples_of_negative_numbers | negative numbers]] in everyday life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## What Are Negative Numbers?

A [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negative number]] is generally defined as any number less than zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### Real-Life Examples

*   **Temperature**: When measuring temperature, if it's 3 degrees Celsius and gets 4 degrees colder, the temperature drops below zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. One degree below zero is called negative 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Bank Account**: If you have $10 in your bank account and spend $30, you'll owe the bank money, resulting in a negative balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. For example, $10 minus $30 is negative $20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. A negative balance means you owe the bank; you've gone in the reverse direction from having money to spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

## Visualizing Negative Numbers on a Number Line

The [[using_a_number_line_for_adding_and_subtracting | number line]] is a key tool for understanding [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negative numbers]] and performing operations with them:
*   As you move to the right of zero on the [[using_a_number_line_for_adding_and_subtracting | number line]], values increase in positive numbers (e.g., 1, 2, 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   As you move to the left of zero, you encounter negative numbers (e.g., -1, -2, -3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   A larger negative number (e.g., -3) is *less than* a smaller negative number (e.g., -1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. For instance, -100 is much smaller than -1, representing a greater "lack" of something like heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## [[adding_and_subtracting_negative_numbers | Adding and Subtracting Negative Numbers]]

When [[adding_and_subtracting_negative_numbers | adding and subtracting]] [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negative numbers]], visualizing the [[using_a_number_line_for_adding_and_subtracting | number line]] is highly encouraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

*   **Subtracting**: When you subtract or move in a "colder" direction (e.g., losing money), you move to the left on the [[using_a_number_line_for_adding_and_subtracting | number line]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. The numbers get smaller, even past zero into the negatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
*   **Adding**: When you add (e.g., receive a paycheck), you move to the right on the [[using_a_number_line_for_adding_and_subtracting | number line]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Examples

*   **3 - 4**: Starting at 3, move 4 units to the left.
    *   1 unit left: 2
    *   2 units left: 1
    *   3 units left: 0
    *   4 units left: -1
    *   Result: -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>

*   **2 - 8**: Starting at 2, move 8 units to the left.
    *   Moving 2 units left reaches 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
    *   You need to move 6 more units to the left (8 - 2 = 6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
    *   Counting 6 units left from 0: -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6.
    *   Result: -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>

*   **-4 - 2**: Starting at -4, move 2 units to the left.
    *   1 unit left: -5
    *   2 units left: -6
    *   Result: -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>

*   **-3 + 2**: Starting at -3, move 2 units to the right.
    *   1 unit right: -2
    *   2 units right: -1
    *   Result: -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>

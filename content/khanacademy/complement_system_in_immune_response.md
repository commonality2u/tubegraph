The [[nonspecific_immune_response_and_inflammatory_response | nonspecific]] complement system is a component of the immune system that plays a role in the initial "field of battle" against pathogens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, particularly when an invading pathogen bypasses the first line of defense such as the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Nature and Activation
The complement system is a set of proteins that are typically found floating in the blood plasma in an inactive state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. When the [[inflammatory_response_overview | inflammatory response]] is triggered, these proteins become activated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. This activation often involves them being "cleaved up" into smaller, active versions, though the exact mechanisms are not yet fully understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.

## Role in Immune Response
Once activated, the cleaved versions of these proteins are effective in a [[nonspecific_immune_response_and_inflammatory_response | nonspecific]] manner at helping to kill off invading pathogens, such as bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. It functions as a "good kind of first line of [[nonspecific_immune_response_and_inflammatory_response | nonspecific]] fight" against invading pathogens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.

[[Understanding the concept of slope | Slope]] tells us how steep a line is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The fundamental formula for [[finding the slope of a line | slope]] is [[understanding slope as change in y over change in x | change in y over change in x]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This can also be represented using the capital Greek letter delta (Δ) as Δy/Δx, which means "change in y over change in x" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

A key property of a [[Slope of a Straight Line | line]] is that its slope will always be constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This means that you can choose any two distinct points on the line to calculate its slope, and you will always arrive at the same value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

## Calculating Slope from a Graph

To [[interpreting slope from a graph | interpret slope from a graph]], select two points with "nice integer coordinates" that are easy to read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

### Example 1: Moving Right

Let's consider a line on a graph:

1.  **Starting Point**: Pick a point, for example, (-3, -3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
2.  **Ending Point**: Move to another point, such as (0, -1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
3.  **Calculate Change in x (Δx)**:
    *   Moving from x = -3 to x = 0 means the x-value increased by 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
    *   Δx = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
4.  **Calculate Change in y (Δy)**:
    *   Moving from y = -3 to y = -1 means the y-value increased by 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
    *   Δy = 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
5.  **Calculate Slope**:
    *   Slope = Δy / Δx = 2 / 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

### Example 2: Moving Left (or different points)

Even if you choose different points or move in a different direction, the calculated slope will remain the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

1.  **Starting Point**: Pick a different point, for example, (3, 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
2.  **Ending Point**: Move to the point (-3, -3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
3.  **Calculate Change in y (Δy)**:
    *   Moving from y = 1 down to y = -3 means the y-value decreased by 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
    *   Δy = -4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
4.  **Calculate Change in x (Δx)**:
    *   Moving from x = 3 back to x = -3 means the x-value decreased by 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
    *   Δx = -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
5.  **Calculate Slope**:
    *   Slope = Δy / Δx = -4 / -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
    *   The negatives cancel out, resulting in 4/6, which simplifies to 2/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

> [!INFO] [[consistency in calculating slope | Consistency]] is key!
> No matter which two points you choose on a line, and no matter which direction you go, you will get the same slope value, provided you are [[consistency in calculating slope | consistent]] in how you define your start and end points for both x and y changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. For example, if you consider a downward movement for y as negative, then a movement to the left for x must also be considered negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

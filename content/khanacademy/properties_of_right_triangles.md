[[introduction_to_basic_trigonometry | Trigonometry]], often simplified as "trig," is the study of the ratios of sides of triangles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The term "trig" literally means triangle, and "metry" means measure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. It is a topic that sounds complicated but simplifies to understanding these ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Defining a Right Triangle

A **right triangle** is characterized by having one angle that measures exactly 90 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This specific angle is referred to as a right angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Sides of a Right Triangle

In a right triangle, the sides are given specific names based on their relationship to the angles:

*   **Hypotenuse**: This is the side directly opposite the 90-degree angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. It is always the longest side of a right triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   **Opposite Side**: For any given acute angle in the triangle, the opposite side is the one that the angle "opens onto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   **Adjacent Side**: For any given acute angle, the adjacent side is one of the two sides that form the angle, but it is *not* the hypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

### Example: A 3-4-5 Right Triangle
Consider a right triangle with side lengths 3, 4, and 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The side with length 5 is the hypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## [[pythagorean_theorem_in_right_triangles | Pythagorean Theorem]]

A fundamental property of right triangles is described by the [[pythagorean_theorem_in_right_triangles | Pythagorean theorem]]. It states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b):
a² + b² = c² <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

For the 3-4-5 triangle, this can be verified: 3² + 4² = 9 + 16 = 25, which is equal to 5² <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## [[trigonometric_functions_and_right_triangles | Trigonometric Functions]]

The core [[trigonometric_functions_and_right_triangles | functions of trigonometry]]—sine, cosine, and tangent—specify the ratios of certain sides for any angle within a right triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

These [[trigonometric_functions_definition_for_right_triangles | trigonometric functions definition for right triangles]] can be remembered using the mnemonic **SOH CAH TOA** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>:

*   **SOH**: **S**ine = **O**pposite / **H**ypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>
*   **CAH**: **C**osine = **A**djacent / **H**ypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>
*   **TOA**: **T**angent = **O**pposite / **A**djacent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>

### Applying Trigonometric Ratios

Let's use the 3-4-5 right triangle and calculate the trigonometric ratios for two different angles.

#### For Angle Theta (θ)
*   **Sine (θ)**: Opposite side is 3, Hypotenuse is 5.
    > sin(θ) = Opposite / Hypotenuse = 3/5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>
*   **Cosine (θ)**: Adjacent side is 4, Hypotenuse is 5.
    > cos(θ) = Adjacent / Hypotenuse = 4/5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>
*   **Tangent (θ)**: Opposite side is 3, Adjacent side is 4.
    > tan(θ) = Opposite / Adjacent = 3/4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>

#### For Angle X
*   **Sine (x)**: Opposite side is 4, Hypotenuse is 5.
    > sin(x) = Opposite / Hypotenuse = 4/5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>
*   **Cosine (x)**: Adjacent side is 3, Hypotenuse is 5.
    > cos(x) = Adjacent / Hypotenuse = 3/5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>
*   **Tangent (x)**: Opposite side is 4, Adjacent side is 3.
    > tan(x) = Opposite / Adjacent = 4/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>

### Scope of SOH CAH TOA
The SOH CAH TOA definitions are primarily used for angles between 0 and 90 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. For angles outside this range or for values exactly at the boundaries (0 or 90 degrees), more generalized definitions of trigonometric functions are introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

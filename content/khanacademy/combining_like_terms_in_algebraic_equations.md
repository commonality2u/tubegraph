[[Solving algebraic equations | Algebraic equations]] can often be simplified by [[combining_like_terms_in_mathematical_expressions | combining like terms]]. This process is essential for systematically [[solving_algebraic_equations | solving algebraic equations]], especially as they become more complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Understanding Algebraic Expressions
An [[understanding_algebraic_expressions | algebraic expression]] like `7x` literally means "7 times x" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. In [[understanding_relationships_and_equations_in_algebra | algebra]], the multiplication symbol is generally omitted when a number (coefficient) is written next to a variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This is a shorthand notation, and avoids confusion because 'x' is the most common variable used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

The coefficient is the number that multiplies the variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. For example, in `7x`, '7' is the coefficient.

## The Principle of Equality in Equations
When [[solving_algebraic_equations | solving algebraic equations]], it's crucial to understand that an equation states that one side is equal to the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. To maintain this equality, any operation performed on one side of the equation must also be performed on the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. This principle is fundamental to [[algebraic_techniques_for_solving_equations | algebraic techniques for solving equations]].

To [[isolating_variables_in_algebraic_equations | isolate a variable]] when it's multiplied by a coefficient, you typically divide both sides of the equation by that coefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. For instance, in `7x = 14`, dividing both sides by 7 yields `x = 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Dividing by a number is equivalent to multiplying by its reciprocal (e.g., dividing by 3 is the same as multiplying by 1/3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

## Combining Like Terms in Equations
[[Understanding like terms in algebra | Like terms]] are terms that have the same variables raised to the same power. They can be combined to simplify an expression or equation.

### Example: 2y + 4y = 18
Consider the equation `2y + 4y = 18` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
1.  **Visualization of terms:**
    *   `2y` literally means `y + y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
    *   `4y` literally means `y + y + y + y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
2.  **Combine the terms:** If you add `2y` and `4y` together, you are combining `(y + y) + (y + y + y + y)`. Counting all the 'y's, you get six 'y's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
    *   This is analogous to saying "2 apples plus 4 apples equals 6 apples" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
    *   So, `2y + 4y` simplifies to `6y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
3.  **Solve the simplified equation:** The equation becomes `6y = 18` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
    *   To [[isolating_variables_in_algebraic_equations | isolate y]], divide both sides by the coefficient, 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
    *   `6y / 6 = 18 / 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>
    *   `y = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>

### Checking the Solution
You can always verify your answer by substituting the value of the variable back into the original equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
For `y = 3`:
`2(3) + 4(3) = 18` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>
`6 + 12 = 18` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>
`18 = 18` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>
The solution is correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

This article provides an introduction to the concepts of perimeter and area, focusing on [[introduction_to_geometry_terms | rectangles]] and [[perfect_squares_in_algebra | squares]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Perimeter

Perimeter is defined as the total distance around the outside of a figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. It can be thought of as the length of a fence required to enclose something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

### Rectangles

A [[introduction_to_geometry_terms | rectangle]] is a geometric figure characterized by four sides and four [[introduction_to_geometry_terms | right angles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. In a rectangle, opposite sides are equal in length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

*   **Example: Calculating Perimeter of a Rectangle**
    Consider a rectangle ABCD where side AB is 7 units long and side BC is 5 units long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
    *   Since opposite sides are equal, side DC is also 7 units long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, and side AD is 5 units long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
    *   The perimeter is the sum of all side lengths: 7 + 5 + 7 + 5 = 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

### Squares

A [[perfect_squares_in_algebra | square]] is a special type of [[introduction_to_geometry_terms | rectangle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. It also has four sides and four [[introduction_to_geometry_terms | right angles]], but all of its sides are equal in length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. These equal side lengths are often referred to as congruent [[rays_and_lines_in_geometry | segments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

*   **Example: Calculating Side Length from Perimeter of a Square**
    If a [[perfect_squares_in_algebra | square]] has a perimeter of 36 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>, and each side is denoted by 'x' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>:
    *   The perimeter formula for a [[perfect_squares_in_algebra | square]] is x + x + x + x = 4x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
    *   Setting 4x equal to the given perimeter: 4x = 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
    *   Dividing both sides by 4, we find that x = 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. Thus, it is a 9 by 9 [[perfect_squares_in_algebra | square]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

## Area

Area measures how much two-dimensional space a figure occupies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. One way to conceptualize area is by determining how many 1-by-1 [[perfect_squares_in_algebra | squares]] can fit within the figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

### Rectangles

The area of a [[introduction_to_geometry_terms | rectangle]] is found by multiplying its two dimensions (length and width) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. For example, a "5 by 7 [[introduction_to_geometry_terms | rectangle]]" implies one side is 5 units and the adjacent side is 7 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

*   **Example: Calculating Area of a Rectangle**
    For the rectangle ABCD with dimensions 7 by 5:
    *   The area is calculated as the product of the length and width: 7 * 5 = 35 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
    *   This means 35 1-by-1 [[perfect_squares_in_algebra | squares]] can fit inside the rectangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

### Squares

A [[perfect_squares_in_algebra | square]] is a [[introduction_to_geometry_terms | rectangle]] where the length and width are identical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

*   **Example: Calculating Area of a Square**
    If a [[perfect_squares_in_algebra | square]] has a side length of 2 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>:
    *   The area is calculated by multiplying the side length by itself: 2 * 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
    *   This operation is known as [[perfect_squares_in_algebra | "squaring"]] the number, which is where the term "squaring" comes from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
    *   The area is 2^2 = 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. You can fit four 1-by-1 [[perfect_squares_in_algebra | squares]] within a 2-by-2 [[perfect_squares_in_algebra | square]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

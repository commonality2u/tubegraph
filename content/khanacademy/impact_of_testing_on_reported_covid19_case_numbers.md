The reported number of COVID-19 cases often differs significantly from the actual number of cases due to various factors related to testing availability and criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This discrepancy means that publicly available figures can severely [[Differences between reported and actual COVID19 cases | understate the true spread]] of the virus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

## Discrepancy Between Reported and Actual Cases

The reported number of COVID-19 cases typically reflects individuals who have been tested and confirmed positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. However, many people may not be tested because they:
*   Have not yet developed symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   Experience symptoms that are not severe enough to warrant a test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

Consequently, the actual number of cases is likely "far larger than the number of confirmed cases" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Case Study: Hubei Province, China

Analysis by Thomas Pueyo, as featured in a blog post, illustrates the difference between reported and actual cases using data from Hubei Province, where Wuhan is located <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

On January 23rd, 2020:
*   The number of confirmed new cases (yellow bar) was approximately 300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   The actual number of new cases (gray bar) was close to 2,500, roughly eight times higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### How Actual Cases Were Determined (in hindsight)

Chinese officials were able to estimate actual new cases by asking individuals who tested positive when they first experienced symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. If a person reported symptom onset 10 days prior, they were counted as an actual new case on that earlier date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This allowed for a retrospective calculation of actual cases, providing a more accurate picture of the virus's spread over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

### Impact of Shutdown and Lagging Data

In Hubei, the city of Wuhan was shut down on January 23rd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   Before the shutdown, actual cases were already significantly higher than confirmed cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   After the shutdown, actual cases (calculated in hindsight) began to flatten and decrease a few days later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   However, confirmed new cases continued to rise for some time due to the delay between symptom onset and testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

This delay demonstrates that reported cases often lag behind the true situation on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. For instance, as of January 22nd, before the city shutdown, the cumulative actual cases were approximately 12,000, while confirmed cases totaled only around 444 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

## Testing Capacity and Understatement of Cases

The ratio between actual and confirmed cases can be even higher in geographies with less robust testing compared to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. As of March 3rd, 2020, countries like the United States were not performing as many tests per million citizens as other nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. This under-testing in the early stages meant that the number of reported cases in places like the U.S. was significantly "understating the number of actual cases out there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

### [[Estimating actual COVID19 cases from deaths | Estimating Actual Cases]]

To estimate the actual number of cases, analysts like Thomas Pueyo consider factors such as:
*   Mortality rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   [[Time from infection to death estimation in COVID19 cases | Time from infection to death]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   The virus's spread rate (days to doubling) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

For example, assuming a 1% [[Factors influencing COVID19 mortality rates | mortality rate]] and a 20-day average time from infection to death, one reported death today could indicate 100 infections 20 days prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. If the infection doubles every five days, those 100 cases could have grown to approximately 1,600 cases by today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

This highlights that even a small number of reported deaths can imply a much larger, unreported number of current infections, especially in areas with limited testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

## Conclusion

The significant lag and disparity between reported and actual COVID-19 cases, largely driven by testing capacity and practices, underscore the serious nature of the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. Relying solely on reported data can lead to complacency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. Social isolation and precautions are crucial to lower the spread rate, prevent overwhelming healthcare systems, and keep the [[Factors influencing COVID19 mortality rates | mortality rate]] as low as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

Learning is an inherent human capability, as "nobody's born smart; we all start at zero" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. From not being able to talk, walk, or do algebra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, everyone starts with no skills in anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Even historical figures like Einstein had to learn [[basic_skills_development | basic skills development]] such as counting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, and Shakespeare learned his ABCs just like everyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## The Process of Learning

Humans are "born to learn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The learning process often involves stumbling, slipping, crawling, falling, and failing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This can be frustrating and confusing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. However, persistent struggling eventually leads to progress, such as learning to walk one foot in front of the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Every wrong answer contributes to making the brain stronger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Embracing Failure

[[Overcoming_failure | Overcoming failure]] is a fundamental part of [[growth_mindset | growth mindset]]. "Failing is just another word for growing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. True learning involves knowing that one will eventually grasp a concept, even if they haven't succeeded yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## The Foundation of Knowledge

Complex concepts are built upon [[basic_skills_development | basic ideas]] that are universally understandable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Regardless of an individual's background or location, the most crucial understanding is that "you can learn anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

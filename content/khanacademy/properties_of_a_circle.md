The circle is considered the most fundamental shape in our universe, appearing in natural phenomena like planet orbits and at the molecular level, as well as in human inventions such as wheels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Understanding its [[properties_of_substances_and_elements | properties]] is therefore essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Definition of a Circle

A circle is defined as all the points that are equidistant from a central point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Every point along the edge of the circle is the same distance from its center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Key Properties

### [[definition_and_importance_of_radius_and_diameter | Radius]]

The constant distance from the center of the circle to any point on its edge is called the [[definition_and_importance_of_radius_and_diameter | radius]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. By definition, this distance never changes for a given circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### [[definition_and_importance_of_radius_and_diameter | Diameter]]

The [[definition_and_importance_of_radius_and_diameter | diameter]] is the distance along the widest point of a circle, passing through its center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. It can be thought of as two [[definition_and_importance_of_radius_and_diameter | radii]] joined together end-to-end through the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

#### [[relationship_between_diameter_and_radius | Relationship between Diameter and Radius]]
The [[definition_and_importance_of_radius_and_diameter | diameter]] (D) of a circle has a straightforward [[relationship_between_diameter_and_radius | relationship]] with its [[definition_and_importance_of_radius_and_diameter | radius]] (r):
$$D = 2 \times r$$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>

### [[understanding_circumference_and_its_calculation | Circumference]]

The [[understanding_circumference_and_its_calculation | circumference]] is the distance around the circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. It's what you would measure if you wrapped a tape measure around the circle's edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Pi ($\pi$)

For thousands of years, mathematicians observed a consistent [[relationship_between_diameter_and_radius | relationship]] between a circle's [[understanding_circumference_and_its_calculation | circumference]] and its [[definition_and_importance_of_radius_and_diameter | diameter]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. When the [[understanding_circumference_and_its_calculation | circumference]] was divided by the [[definition_and_importance_of_radius_and_diameter | diameter]], the result was always approximately 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, regardless of the circle's size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

As measurement techniques improved, this ratio was found to be a non-repeating, non-terminating decimal: 3.14159... <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This unique and fundamental number is named Pi (symbol: $\pi$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. It represents the ratio of a circle's [[understanding_circumference_and_its_calculation | circumference]] to its [[definition_and_importance_of_radius_and_diameter | diameter]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

*   $\pi \approx 3.14159$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>
*   $\frac{\text{Circumference}}{\text{Diameter}} = \pi$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>

### Formulas for [[understanding_circumference_and_its_calculation | Circumference]]

From the definition of Pi, we can derive formulas to calculate the [[understanding_circumference_and_its_calculation | circumference]] (C):

1.  **Using Diameter**: By multiplying both sides of the ratio by the [[definition_and_importance_of_radius_and_diameter | diameter]], we get:
    $C = \pi \times D$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>
2.  **Using Radius**: Since the [[definition_and_importance_of_radius_and_diameter | diameter]] is equal to two times the [[definition_and_importance_of_radius_and_diameter | radius]] ($D = 2r$), we can substitute this into the formula:
    $C = \pi \times (2r)$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>
    This is commonly written as:
    $C = 2\pi r$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>

Pi is a number, similar to any other constant, but is typically left in terms of the symbol $\pi$ for simplicity in calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

## Application Examples

### Example 1: Finding Circumference and Diameter from Radius

If a circle has a [[definition_and_importance_of_radius_and_diameter | radius]] of 3 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>:

*   **Circumference**:
    Using $C = 2\pi r$:
    $C = 2 \times \pi \times 3 \text{ meters}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>
    $C = 6\pi \text{ meters}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>
    (This is approximately $18.85 \text{ meters}$ if $\pi \approx 3.14159$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>)

*   **Diameter**:
    Using $D = 2r$:
    $D = 2 \times 3 \text{ meters}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>
    $D = 6 \text{ meters}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>

### Example 2: Finding Diameter and Radius from Circumference

If a circle has a [[understanding_circumference_and_its_calculation | circumference]] of 10 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>:

*   **Diameter**:
    Using $C = \pi D$:
    $10 \text{ meters} = \pi \times D$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>
    To solve for D, divide both sides by $\pi$:
    $D = \frac{10}{\pi} \text{ meters}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>
    (This is approximately $3.18 \text{ meters}$ if $\pi \approx 3.14159$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>)

*   **Radius**:
    The [[definition_and_importance_of_radius_and_diameter | radius]] is half the [[definition_and_importance_of_radius_and_diameter | diameter]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>:
    $r = \frac{1}{2} \times D$
    $r = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{10}{\pi} \text{ meters}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>
    $r = \frac{5}{\pi} \text{ meters}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>

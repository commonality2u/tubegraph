The circle is considered a fundamental shape in our universe, appearing in phenomena from the orbits of planets to molecular structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Understanding its [[properties_of_probability_distributions | properties]] is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Defining a Circle
A circle is defined as all points that are an equal distance from a central point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This means every point along the edge of a circle is equidistant from its center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Key Properties

### [[definition_and_importance_of_radius | Radius]]
The [[definition_and_importance_of_radius | radius]] is the specific distance from the center of a circle to any point on its edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. By definition, for any given circle, the [[definition_and_importance_of_radius | radius]] never changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. For example, if a [[definition_and_importance_of_radius | radius]] is 3 centimeters, then all radii of that circle will be 3 centimeters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### [[definition_and_importance_of_diameter | Diameter]]
The [[definition_and_importance_of_diameter | diameter]] is the distance across the widest point of a circle, passing through its center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This widest point is essentially two radii extending in opposite directions from the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
The relationship between the [[definition_and_importance_of_diameter | diameter]] (D) and the [[definition_and_importance_of_radius | radius]] (r) is straightforward:
$D = 2r$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>

### [[understanding_circumference | Circumference]]
The [[understanding_circumference | circumference]] of a circle is the total distance around its edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>. It is analogous to the [[basics_of_perimeter | perimeter]] of other shapes.

## The Constant Pi (π)
For thousands of years, people measured the [[understanding_circumference | circumference]] and [[definition_and_importance_of_diameter | diameter]] of various circles. They observed that the ratio of the [[understanding_circumference | circumference]] to the [[definition_and_importance_of_diameter | diameter]] was consistently the same, regardless of the circle's size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. Initially, this ratio was roughly estimated to be 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.

As measurement tools improved, the value was refined, revealing a number like 3.1, then 3.14159, and so on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. This number was found to be a non-repeating, non-terminating decimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. Due to its fundamental nature and constant appearance in relation to circles, this "magical number" was given the name **Pi** (symbolized by the Greek letter π) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.

Pi is one of the most fascinating and fundamental numbers in mathematics, appearing in many areas beyond just circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.

### Formulas for Circumference
The definition of Pi leads directly to the formulas for a circle's [[understanding_circumference | circumference]]:
The ratio of [[understanding_circumference | circumference]] (C) to [[definition_and_importance_of_diameter | diameter]] (D) is Pi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>:
$C / D = \pi$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>

Rearranging this, we get:
$C = \pi D$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>

Since $D = 2r$, we can also express [[understanding_circumference | circumference]] in terms of the [[definition_and_importance_of_radius | radius]]:
$C = \pi (2r)$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>
or, most commonly:
$C = 2\pi r$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>

### Pi as a Number
It's important to remember that Pi is just a number, approximately 3.14159 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>. While you can multiply it out to get a decimal approximation using a calculator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>, it's often preferred to leave answers in terms of π for simplicity and exactness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>.

### Examples

#### Example 1: Given Radius, Find Circumference and Diameter
If a circle has a [[definition_and_importance_of_radius | radius]] of 3 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>:
*   **Circumference:**
    $C = 2\pi r$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>
    $C = 2 \times \pi \times 3 \text{ meters}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>
    $C = 6\pi \text{ meters}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>
*   **Diameter:**
    $D = 2r$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>
    $D = 2 \times 3 \text{ meters}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>
    $D = 6 \text{ meters}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>

#### Example 2: Given Circumference, Find Diameter and Radius
If a circle has a [[understanding_circumference | circumference]] of 10 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>:
*   **Diameter:**
    We know $C = \pi D$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>
    $10 \text{ meters} = \pi D$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>
    $D = 10 / \pi \text{ meters}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>
*   **Radius:**
    The [[definition_and_importance_of_radius | radius]] is half the [[definition_and_importance_of_diameter | diameter]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>.
    $r = (1/2) \times D$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>
    $r = (1/2) \times (10 / \pi) \text{ meters}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>
    $r = 5 / \pi \text{ meters}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>

The immune system is broadly categorized into two main components: the innate (or nonspecific) immune system and the adaptive (or specific) immune system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The [[nonspecific_immune_response_and_inflammatory_response | nonspecific]] immune system is the body's initial and general defense mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Characteristics of the Innate Immune System

The innate immune system is considered [[nonspecific_immune_response_and_inflammatory_response | nonspecific]] because its responses are not tailored to particular types of viruses, proteins, or bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Instead, it recognizes general patterns that indicate something "shady" or foreign is present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. For example, it might identify double-stranded DNA floating around, which is characteristic of some viruses, without knowing the specific virus type or if it has been encountered before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This type of immune system is ancient and exists across many species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## First-Line Barriers

The first line of defense within the [[nonspecific_immune_response_and_inflammatory_response | nonspecific]] immune system consists of physical and chemical barriers that prevent pathogens from entering the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. These include:
*   The skin, which acts as a physical barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   Stomach acid, which destroys many ingested pathogens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   The acidity of oils on the surface of the skin, which inhibits microbial growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

These barriers are designed to naturally prevent foreign substances from entering the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Second-Line Defense (Nonspecific)

If pathogens manage to bypass the first-line barriers and enter the body, the [[nonspecific_immune_response_and_inflammatory_response | nonspecific]] immune system employs a second line of defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This includes:

### Inflammatory Response
The [[inflammatory_response_overview | inflammatory response]] is a crucial part of the [[nonspecific_immune_response_and_inflammatory_response | nonspecific]] defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Its primary role is to bring immune cells and molecules to the site of infection or injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. (A more detailed discussion of the [[inflammatory_response_overview | inflammatory response]] is typically covered after exploring the [[specific_immune_system_and_lymphocytes | specific immune system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>).

### Phagocytes
[[role_of_neutrophils_and_other_white_blood_cells | Phagocytes]] are specialized cells that defend the body by engulfing and destroying foreign particles or pathogens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. These cells identify a pathogen as "shady" and proceed to "eat it up" or "kill it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

Key points about [[role_of_neutrophils_and_other_white_blood_cells | phagocytes]]:
*   **Types**: Examples of [[role_of_neutrophils_and_other_white_blood_cells | phagocytes]] include [[role_of_neutrophils_and_other_white_blood_cells | dendritic cells]], [[role_of_neutrophils_and_other_white_blood_cells | macrophages]], and [[role_of_neutrophils_and_other_white_blood_cells | neutrophils]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **White Blood Cells**: All [[role_of_neutrophils_and_other_white_blood_cells | phagocytes]] discussed in the context of the [[nonspecific_immune_response_and_inflammatory_response | nonspecific]] immune system are types of [[role_of_neutrophils_and_other_white_blood_cells | white blood cells]], also known as leukocytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. The term "[[role_of_neutrophils_and_other_white_blood_cells | white blood cell]]" originated from the observation that these cells form a white, frothy layer when blood components are separated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. While [[role_of_neutrophils_and_other_white_blood_cells | phagocytes]] are largely [[nonspecific_immune_response_and_inflammatory_response | nonspecific]], other [[role_of_neutrophils_and_other_white_blood_cells | white blood cells]] (like [[specific_immune_system_and_lymphocytes | lymphocytes]]) participate in the [[specific_immune_system_and_lymphocytes | specific immune system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   **Interaction with Specific Immunity**: Although [[role_of_neutrophils_and_other_white_blood_cells | phagocytes]] are part of the [[nonspecific_immune_response_and_inflammatory_response | nonspecific]] system, their role in presenting antigens can also play a part in initiating the [[specific_immune_system_and_lymphocytes | specific immune system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

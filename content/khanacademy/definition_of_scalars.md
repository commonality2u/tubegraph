A [[difference_between_vectors_and_scalars | scalar]] is a concept that possesses only a magnitude, or size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Unlike [[definition_of_vectors | vectors]], scalars do not include a direction in their definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Characteristics of a Scalar
A scalar quantity is characterized by having only a magnitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This magnitude can be thought of as the "size" of the measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, but without any associated direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Examples of Scalars
The following are common [[examples of vectors and scalars in motion | examples of scalar quantities]]:

### Distance
Distance is a scalar quantity that describes how much something has changed its position without specifying the direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. If one only states a measurement like "5 meters," it is a scalar quantity because it only conveys the size or magnitude of the movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. For instance, knowing an object moved "5 meters" does not indicate if it moved to the right, left, up, or down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

### Time
Time is generally considered a scalar quantity in simple physics contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. Although time progresses in a positive direction, it is not typically associated with a specific spatial direction like "north" or "east" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. For example, a "change in time" of "2 seconds" simply indicates a duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

### Speed
Speed is the scalar quantity that measures how fast something is going <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. It tells you how far an object traveled in a certain amount of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. For instance, if an object moved "2.5 meters per second," this is a scalar because it only provides the magnitude of how fast it went, without any direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

Contrast this with [[definition_of_vectors | velocity]], which is a [[definition_of_vectors | vector]] quantity that includes both speed and direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

Cells are the fundamental units of life, and while all cells share some basic characteristics like a [[cellular_membrane_and_its_role | cellular membrane]] and DNA, a primary division in the living world is based on the presence or absence of a nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. This distinction classifies cells into two main categories: eukaryotes and prokaryotes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Key Distinctions

### Nucleus
The most significant difference between eukaryotes and prokaryotes is the presence of a membrane-bound nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Eukaryotes** have a nucleus, which is a membrane that encloses and separates the DNA (and associated chromatin) from the rest of the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **Prokaryotes** do not possess a nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Their DNA is typically located in a region of the cytoplasm called the nucleoid, but it is not enclosed by a membrane.

### Organelles
Beyond the nucleus, eukaryotes also tend to have a greater array of membrane-bound [[organelle_functions_such_as_ribosomes_endoplasmic_reticulum_and_golgi_bodies | organelles]] within their cytoplasm, each performing specialized functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>.

*   **Eukaryotes** contain various membrane-bound [[organelle_functions_such_as_ribosomes_endoplasmic_reticulum_and_golgi_bodies | organelles]] such as the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi bodies, [[photosynthesis_and_respiration_organelles_like_mitochondria_and_chloroplasts | mitochondria]], and [[photosynthesis_and_respiration_organelles_like_mitochondria_and_chloroplasts | chloroplasts]] (in plants and algae) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>. These [[organelle_functions_such_as_ribosomes_endoplasmic_reticulum_and_golgi_bodies | organelles]] compartmentalize [[cellular_structure_and_functions | cellular functions]], allowing for greater efficiency and complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
*   **Prokaryotes** lack these complex membrane-bound [[organelle_functions_such_as_ribosomes_endoplasmic_reticulum_and_golgi_bodies | organelles]]. While they do have [[organelle_functions_such_as_ribosomes_endoplasmic_reticulum_and_golgi_bodies | ribosomes]] for protein synthesis, these are not membrane-bound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

### Size and Complexity
*   **Eukaryotic cells** tend to be larger and more complex than prokaryotic cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

### Examples
*   **Prokaryotes** include bacteria and archaea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Eukaryotes** encompass a wide range of organisms, including plants, animals (like humans), and fungi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## Evolutionary Perspective
From an evolutionary standpoint, the classification of organisms based solely on the presence or absence of a nucleus might not be the most accurate initial division. Instead, it is more logical to consider three separate primary groups: eukaryotes, bacteria, and archaea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

Interestingly, some eukaryotic [[organelle_functions_such_as_ribosomes_endoplasmic_reticulum_and_golgi_bodies | organelles]], such as [[photosynthesis_and_respiration_organelles_like_mitochondria_and_chloroplasts | mitochondria]] and [[photosynthesis_and_respiration_organelles_like_mitochondria_and_chloroplasts | chloroplasts]], contain their own DNA and can reproduce independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>. This observation has led to the belief that their ancestors were once independent prokaryotic organisms that eventually formed a symbiotic relationship within larger eukaryotic cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>.

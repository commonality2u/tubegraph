A [[definition_of_a_function | function]] is defined as something that takes an input, processes it, and based on that input, produces a single, given output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## [[function_notation_and_usage | Function Notation]]
Functions are typically denoted using [[function_notation and usage | function notation]], such as `f(x)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. In this notation, `x` is commonly used as the variable for the input into the function, and `f` is a frequently used name for the function itself, though other variables and names can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Examples of Functions with Conditions

### Conditional Function: `f(x)`
One example of a function with conditions is `f(x)` defined as:
*   `x^2`, if `x` is even <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>
*   `x + 5`, if `x` is odd <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>

To [[evaluating_expressions_with_different_variable_values | evaluate expressions with different variable values]] for this function:
*   **`f(2)`**: Since 2 is an even number, the function uses the `x^2` rule. Therefore, `f(2)` is `2^2`, which equals 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   **`f(3)`**: Since 3 is an odd number, the function uses the `x + 5` rule. Therefore, `f(3)` is `3 + 5`, which equals 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

### "Wacky" Function: `h(a)`
A function can be defined in a very general way, not just with mathematical operations. For example, `h(a)` can be defined as the next largest number that starts with the same letter as variable `a`, assuming numbers are written in English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

To [[evaluating_expressions_with_different_variable_values | evaluate expressions with different variable values]] for this function:
*   **`h(2)`**: The number 2 starts with a 'T'. The next largest number starting with a 'T' is 3 (three). So, `h(2)` is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   **`h(8)`**: The number 8 starts with an 'E'. The next largest number starting with an 'E' (after eight) is 11 (eleven). So, `h(8)` is 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
This demonstrates the broad applicability of functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

### Standard Linear Function: `y = x + 1`
Many familiar equations can be viewed as functions. For instance, `y = x + 1` can be written in [[function_notation_and_usage | function notation]] as `f(x) = x + 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

When using this [[function_notation_and_usage | function notation]]:
*   `f(0)` is `0 + 1 = 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   `f(2)` is `2 + 1 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
This is similar to creating a table of values where `x` is the input and `y` (or `f(x)`) is the output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## What is [[concept_of_a_nonfunction | Not a Function]]?
A [[definition_of_a_function | function]] must produce *only one* possible output for any given input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

### Example: A Circle
Consider the equation of a circle centered at the origin with radius 2: `x^2 + y^2 = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

Using [[graphical_representation_and_visual_understanding_of_functions | graphical representation and visual understanding of functions]]:
*   If you choose an `x` value, such as `x = 1`, there are two corresponding `y` values on the circle: one positive and one negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

Algebraically:
*   When `x = 1`, the equation becomes `1^2 + y^2 = 4`, which simplifies to `1 + y^2 = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
*   Subtracting 1 from both sides gives `y^2 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   Solving for `y` yields `y = ±√3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

Since a single input (`x=1`) results in two different outputs (`√3` and `-√3`), this relationship is [[concept_of_a_nonfunction | not a function]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. A function can only have one output for a given input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

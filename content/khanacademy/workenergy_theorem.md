The [[concept_of_work_in_physics | concepts of work and energy]] are fundamental in physics, though their everyday meanings may differ slightly from their scientific definitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. While verbal definitions can be circular, understanding them through [[visual_representation_of_equations | equations]] provides a more quantitative and intuitive grasp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Definitions of Work and Energy

*   **Work**: Wikipedia defines [[concept_of_work_in_physics | work]] as "[[definition_and_understanding_of_energy | energy]] transferred by a force" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   **Energy**: Wikipedia defines [[definition_and_understanding_of_energy | energy]] as "the ability to do [[concept_of_work_in_physics | work]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

The connection between [[concept_of_work_in_physics | work]] and [[definition_and_understanding_of_energy | energy]] is deeply intertwined, as reflected in their definitions and shared units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Quantitative Definition of Work

In mechanics, the definition of [[concept_of_work_in_physics | work]] is quantitatively expressed as:
$$
\text{Work} = \text{Force} \times \text{Distance}
$$
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>

### Units of Work

The unit of [[concept_of_work_in_physics | work]] is the Newton meter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. One Newton meter is also defined as one **Joule** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The Joule is the standard unit for both [[concept_of_work_in_physics | work]] and [[definition_and_understanding_of_energy | energy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

**Example**: If a force of 10 Newtons is applied to move a block 7 meters, the [[concept_of_work_in_physics | work]] done is calculated as:
$$
\text{Work} = 10 \text{ Newtons} \times 7 \text{ meters} = 70 \text{ Newton meters (or 70 Joules)}
$$

## Work and Kinetic Energy

When a force is applied to an object over a distance, it performs [[concept_of_work_in_physics | work]] on that object. If the object starts from rest and is subjected to a constant force, it will accelerate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. This acceleration leads to a final velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

Consider a block of mass 'm' at rest, with a force 'F' applied over a distance 'd' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Using kinematics, the final velocity ($v_f$) can be determined:
$$
v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2ad
$$
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>
Since the initial velocity ($v_i$) is 0 for an object starting at rest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>:
$$
v_f^2 = 2ad
$$
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>
From Newton's second law, acceleration ($a$) equals Force (F) divided by mass (m) ($F=ma \implies a = F/m$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Substituting this into the equation:
$$
v_f^2 = 2 \left( \frac{F}{m} \right) d
$$
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>
Rearranging the terms to isolate "Force times distance" (which is [[concept_of_work_in_physics | work]]):
$$
v_f^2 = \frac{2 (F \times d)}{m}
$$
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>
Since Work ($W$) is defined as $F \times d$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>:
$$
v_f^2 = \frac{2W}{m}
$$
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>
Multiplying both sides by 'm' and dividing by 2 (or multiplying by 1/2):
$$
\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 = W
$$
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>

This derived formula shows that the [[concept_of_work_in_physics | work]] done on an object is equal to the change in its kinetic energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

### Kinetic Energy

The term $\frac{1}{2}mv^2$ is defined as **[[kinetic_energy_formula | kinetic energy]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   [[kinetic_energy_formula | Kinetic energy]] is the [[definition_and_understanding_of_energy | energy]] an object possesses due to its motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
*   It represents the [[concept_of_work_in_physics | work]] needed to accelerate an object from rest to its current velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   The [[kinetic_energy_formula | kinetic energy formula]] is typically written as $KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
*   The unit of [[kinetic_energy_formula | kinetic energy]] is also Joules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

This relationship between [[concept_of_work_in_physics | work]] and [[kinetic_energy_formula | kinetic energy]] is a fundamental concept in physics, highlighting how [[definition_and_understanding_of_energy | energy]] is transferred and transformed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. It sets the stage for understanding the [[law_of_conservation_of_energy | law of conservation of energy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

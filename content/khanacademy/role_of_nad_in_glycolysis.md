[[overview_of_glycolysis | Glycolysis]] is a crucial biochemical pathway where glucose is broken down into two pyruvate molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. In addition to producing a net of two ATPs, it also involves the reduction of [[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | NAD]] to [[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | NADH]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## [[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | NAD]] and [[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | NADH]]
NAD stands for Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. It is a large molecule with a positive charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. During reduction, [[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | NAD]] gains a hydrogen and an electron, losing its positive charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. On a net basis, it gains a hydride (a hydrogen with an extra electron) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Thus, [[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | NAD+]] is reduced to [[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | NADH]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## [[steps_and_reactions_in_glycolysis | Role in Glycolysis]]
The reduction of [[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | NAD]] occurs at a specific step in glycolysis, facilitated by a dehydrogenase enzyme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. This step involves the conversion of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. For every glucose molecule, two molecules of [[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | NAD]] are reduced to two molecules of [[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | NADH]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## Subsequent Utilization of [[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | NADH]]
The [[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | NADH]] produced in [[glycolysis_process_and_its_role_in_breaking_down_glucose | glycolysis]] can be further utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. It can be oxidized in the electron transport chain (as part of oxidative phosphorylation) to generate even more [[atp_production_in_glycolysis | ATPs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

If oxygen is not present, the cell may undergo anaerobic respiration or fermentation, which involves replenishing [[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | NAD+]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

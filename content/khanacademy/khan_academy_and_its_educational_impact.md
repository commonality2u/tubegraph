The Khan Academy is widely recognized for its extensive collection of educational videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The platform currently hosts approximately 2,200 videos covering subjects from basic arithmetic to vector calculus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. It serves millions of students monthly, with 100,000 to 200,000 videos watched daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Genesis and Philosophy
Khan Academy's founder, Salman Khan, began the initiative about five years prior to this discussion while working as an analyst at a hedge fund in Boston <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. He started by remotely tutoring his cousins in New Orleans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. The initial YouTube videos were created as a supplement for his cousins, offering refreshers or additional help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### Why Online Tutoring?
A key insight came when his cousins expressed a preference for learning from his YouTube videos rather than in-person tutoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. This seemingly "backhanded" feedback revealed a profound benefit of [[personalized_and_selfpaced_learning | personalized and self-paced learning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>:
*   **Flexibility:** Students can pause and repeat explanations without feeling like they are wasting the tutor's time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Reduced Embarrassment:** Learners can review older concepts without embarrassment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **Self-Paced Progress:** Students can move ahead if bored or take their time as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   **Intimacy of Learning:** The absence of direct human presence during initial concept absorption can be beneficial, allowing students to learn in the privacy of their own space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### Unexpected Global Reach
Initially, the videos were made public on YouTube simply because there was "no reason to make it private" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. This openness led to unexpected feedback from people around the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Comments included users expressing joy and a "natural high" from understanding complex topics like derivatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. The platform also received touching letters, such as one from a parent whose 12-year-old son with autism, who had struggled with math, finally grasped concepts like decimals and fractions through the videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. This demonstrated the content was more than "just a nice to have" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

## Evolution of the Learning Model
After realizing the broader impact, Khan left his job to formalize Khan Academy as a non-profit organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. The content is designed to be timeless, potentially helping future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Flipping the Classroom
Teachers began adopting Khan Academy videos to [[flipping_the_classroom_model | flip the classroom]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. In this model:
*   Lectures are assigned as homework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
*   Classroom time is used for problem-solving and interaction, allowing students to work at their own pace and teachers to provide individual support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   This application of [[online_learning_and_technology_in_education | technology in the classroom]] fundamentally "humanizes" the learning experience by removing the "one size fits all" lecture and fostering interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

### Mastery-Based Learning
Khan Academy emphasizes mastery over traditional snapshot assessments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. The platform's exercises require students to achieve 10 correct answers in a row to demonstrate proficiency before moving to the next concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. This addresses the "Swiss cheese" gaps in understanding that can accumulate in traditional schooling, where students move on regardless of incomplete comprehension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. The model encourages experimentation and failure on the path to mastery, unlike traditional systems that penalize such attempts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

### The Knowledge Map
All learning modules are interconnected within a "knowledge map" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. Starting from basic concepts like single-digit addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>, mastery of one module unlocks more advanced ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. This framework has the potential to teach a vast range of subjects, including logic, computer programming, grammar, and genetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

## Classroom Implementation and Data-Driven Insights
In a pilot program with the Los Altos school district, two fifth-grade and two seventh-grade classes replaced their traditional math curriculum and textbooks with Khan Academy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. The software occupies roughly half of their math class time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. This frees up time for more engaging activities like simulations, games, and project-based learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

Teachers use a live dashboard to monitor student progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. This dashboard displays:
*   **Proficiency:** Green indicates mastery, blue means in progress, and red signifies a student is stuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
*   **Granular Data:** Teachers can see what students have been working on, how long they've spent, which videos they watched (and when they paused/stopped), and specific problems they got right or wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. This allows teachers to intervene precisely where needed, or facilitate peer tutoring by matching proficient students with struggling ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

This data-centric approach, common in other fields, arms teachers with the information to make their interactions with students as productive as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

### Challenging Labels
Experience with [[personalized_and_selfpaced_learning | self-paced learning]] in classrooms has repeatedly shown that students initially perceived as "slow" or "gifted" often change roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. Students who take longer on one concept may quickly race ahead once they grasp it, blurring the lines between traditional labels of ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. This raises questions about how much academic labels are simply "due to a coincidence of time" in a rigid system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>.

## [[global_reach_and_goals_of_khan_academy | Global Reach and Future Vision]]
Khan Academy's goal is to use [[online_learning_and_technology_in_education | technology to humanize education]] on a global scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. The shift to a flipped classroom model dramatically increases the "student to valuable human time with the teacher" ratio from potentially 5% to 100% of the teacher's time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

This model has significant implications for:
*   **Adult Learners:** Provides a non-embarrassing way for adults to remediate past knowledge before returning to college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.
*   **Underserved Populations:** Offers an opportunity for individuals, like a street kid in Calcutta, to gain an education on their own schedule without shame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.
*   **Global Peer-to-Peer Tutoring:** The system allows for seamless peer-to-peer tutoring beyond a single classroom, envisioning a [[the_universality_of_learning | global one-world classroom]] where students from different parts of the world can teach each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.

### Motivation and Engagement
To further engage learners, Khan Academy incorporates "game mechanics" such as badges, energy points, and leaderboards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>. Even subtle changes in wording or point allocation can significantly influence the learning behavior of tens of thousands of students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

Khan Academy's system is ready for broader adoption, with a million users already on the site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>. The ability to track student progress continuously, even across summers and different teachers, provides an unprecedented level of data continuity for districts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. Most teacher-facing features are driven by teacher feedback, ensuring the tools meet their needs effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.

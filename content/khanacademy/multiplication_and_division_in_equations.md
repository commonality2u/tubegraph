When encountering mathematical equations, particularly in algebra, understanding how to apply [[multiplication_properties_and_concepts | multiplication]] and [[dividing_to_solve_equations | division]] is crucial for [[using_algebraic_steps_to_solve_equations | solving equations]] systematically.

## Understanding the Basics of Multiplication in Equations

An equation like `7x = 14` signifies "7 times x is equal to 14" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. While simple equations can sometimes be solved mentally by recalling [[multiplication_properties_and_concepts | times tables]] (e.g., recognizing that 7 times 2 equals 14, so x = 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, a systematic approach is necessary for more complex problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. It's important to [[understanding_mathematical_equations | understand what equations represent]] and how to manipulate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

In algebra, the multiplication symbol (x or ·) is often omitted when a number is placed next to a variable (e.g., `7x` instead of `7 × x`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This shorthand notation avoids confusion, especially since 'x' is a common variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

> [!info] Definition of Multiplication
> The expression `7x` literally means 'x added to itself 7 times' (x + x + x + x + x + x + x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. This is the fundamental definition of [[addition_and_multiplication_relationship | multiplication]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Solving Equations Using Division

The most common method for [[solving_linear_equations_using_division_and_multiplication | solving linear equations using division and multiplication]] is to [[dividing_to_solve_equations | divide both sides of the equation]] by the coefficient (the number multiplying the variable) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

> [!example] Example: `7x = 14`
> 1.  **Identify the coefficient:** The coefficient of 'x' is 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
> 2.  **Divide both sides by the coefficient:**
>     `7x / 7 = 14 / 7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>
> 3.  **Simplify:**
>     `x = 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>

This principle works because if two sides of an equation are equal, performing the same operation (like division) on both sides maintains the equality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. If you divide the left side (7x) into seven equal groups, you get 'x'. To keep the equation balanced, you must also divide the right side (14) into seven equal groups, resulting in 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

## Solving Equations Using Multiplication (Reciprocal)

An alternative, but equivalent, method to [[dividing_to_solve_equations | dividing to solve equations]] is to [[solving_linear_equations_using_division_and_multiplication | multiply both sides by the reciprocal]] of the coefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

> [!example] Example: `3x = 15`
> 1.  **Identify the coefficient:** The coefficient is 3.
> 2.  **Identify the reciprocal:** The reciprocal of 3 is 1/3.
> 3.  **Multiply both sides by the reciprocal:**
>     `(1/3) * 3x = 15 * (1/3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>
> 4.  **Simplify:**
>     `1x = 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>
>     `x = 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>

[[multiplying_fractions | Multiplying by 1/3]] is the exact same operation as [[dividing_to_solve_equations | dividing by 3]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

## Equations with Multiple Terms

When an equation has multiple terms involving the same variable, simplify it first by combining like terms.

> [!example] Example: `2y + 4y = 18`
> 1.  **Visualize the terms:** `2y` means `y + y`, and `4y` means `y + y + y + y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
> 2.  **Combine like terms:** Adding them together, you have a total of `6y` (y + y + y + y + y + y) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Just as "2 apples plus 4 apples equals 6 apples," "2y plus 4y equals 6y" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
>     The equation simplifies to `6y = 18` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
> 3.  **Solve using division:** Divide both sides by 6:
>     `6y / 6 = 18 / 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>
> 4.  **Simplify:**
>     `y = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>

### Checking the Solution

After solving, you can always check your answer by substituting the value back into the original equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

> [!example] Checking `y = 3` for `2y + 4y = 18`
> `2 * 3 + 4 * 3 = 18` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>
> `6 + 12 = 18` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>
> `18 = 18` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>
> The solution is correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

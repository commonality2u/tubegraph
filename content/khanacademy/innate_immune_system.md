The **Innate Immune System** is a fundamental part of the body's defense mechanisms, often referred to as the nonspecific immune system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. It's considered a more ancient adaptation, present across many species and types of organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Its primary characteristic is that it doesn't distinguish between specific types of viruses, proteins, or bacteria; instead, it identifies general characteristics of a threat and acts to eliminate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

### Lines of Defense

The innate immune system is subdivided into two main lines of defense:

#### First Line Barriers
These are the body's initial, physical defenses that prevent pathogens from entering the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Examples include:
*   The skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>
*   Stomach acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>
*   The acidity of oils on the outside of the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>
These are natural [[barrier_defenses_in_nonspecific_immunity | barriers]] designed to prevent foreign entities from entering the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

#### Second Line of Defense
Once pathogens bypass the first line barriers, the second line of defense comes into play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. These mechanisms are still nonspecific, meaning they react to general "shady" characteristics of invaders rather than specific identities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Key components include:

*   **[[inflammatory_response_overview | Inflammatory Response]]**
    This response helps to direct immune components to the site of infection or injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

*   **[[phagocytes_and_their_role_in_immunity | Phagocytes]]**
    These are cells that engulf and destroy foreign particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. They act by eating up anything that appears suspicious, such as double-stranded DNA, which is characteristic of some viruses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

    *   **[[cellular_actors_in_inflammation | Cellular Actors]]**: All [[phagocytes_and_their_role_in_immunity | phagocytes]] are types of white blood cells, also known as leukocytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Examples of [[phagocytes_and_their_role_in_immunity | phagocytes]] that act in the nonspecific immune system include dendritic cells, macrophages, and neutrophils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

### Distinction from the [[adaptive_immune_system | Adaptive Immune System]]
Unlike the [[adaptive_immune_system | specific immune system]], the innate system does not recognize if it has encountered a particular pathogen before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Its responses are immediate and generalized. The [[adaptive_immune system]] is thought to be a newer adaptation in evolutionary terms, particularly in humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. While [[phagocytes_and_their_role_in_immunity | phagocytes]] are largely nonspecific, they also play a role in initiating aspects of the [[adaptive_immune_system | specific immune system]] by presenting antigens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

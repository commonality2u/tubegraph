[[simplifying_expressions | Simplifying expressions]] often involves applying the distributive property and then [[combining_like_terms_in_equations | combining like terms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This process utilizes fundamental arithmetic concepts already known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## The Distributive Property

The distributive property allows a term outside parentheses to be multiplied by each term inside the parentheses.

### Example 1: Simplifying 2(3x + 5)

The expression `2(3x + 5)` literally means two instances of `(3x + 5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This can be written as `(3x + 5) + (3x + 5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

Observing this, we have two `3x` terms and two `5` terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Therefore, the expression is equivalent to `2(3x) + 2(5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This is the distributive property applied directly from arithmetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

Further [[simplifying_expressions | simplification]]:
*   `2 * 3x = 6x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>
*   `2 * 5 = 10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>

Thus, `2(3x + 5)` simplifies to `6x + 10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Combining Like Terms in Complex Expressions

When an expression has multiple sets of parentheses or various terms, the strategy involves first applying the distributive property, then identifying and [[combining_like_terms_in_equations | combining like terms]].

### Example 2: Simplifying 7(3y - 5) - 2(10 + 4y)

1.  **Distribute the first term:** `7(3y - 5)`
    *   `7 * 3y = 21y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>
    *   `7 * -5 = -35` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>
    *   Result: `21y - 35` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>

2.  **Distribute the second term, including its negative sign:** `-2(10 + 4y)`
    *   Think of it as distributing `-2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
    *   `-2 * 10 = -20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>
    *   `-2 * 4y = -8y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>
    *   Result: `-20 - 8y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>

3.  **Combine the results:**
    The original expression now becomes: `21y - 35 - 20 - 8y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

4.  **Identify and [[combining_like_terms_in_equations | combine like terms]]:**
    *   **Terms with 'y':** `21y` and `-8y`
        *   `21y - 8y = 13y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>
    *   **Constant terms:** `-35` and `-20`
        *   `-35 - 20 = -55` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>

5.  **Final simplified expression:** `13y - 55` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

By applying the distributive property and then [[combining_like_terms_in_equations | combining similar or like terms]], complex expressions can be significantly [[simplifying_expressions | simplified]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

[[Simplifying expressions | Simplifying expressions]] often involves applying the distributive property and then [[combining_like_terms_in_algebra | combining like terms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Understanding the Distributive Property

The distributive property allows you to multiply a single term by two or more terms inside a set of parentheses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

For example, to [[simplifying_expressions | simplify the expression]] `2(3x + 5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>:
This literally means two instances of `(3x + 5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
It can be written as `(3x + 5) + (3x + 5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
Applying the distributive property, we multiply `2` by each term inside the parentheses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>:
`2 * (3x) + 2 * (5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>
This simplifies to `6x + 10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Combining Similar or Like Terms

After applying the distributive property, the next step in [[simplifying_expressions | simplifying algebraic expressions]] is to [[combining_like_terms_in_algebra | combine like terms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Like terms are terms that have the same variable raised to the same power.

Consider the more complex [[mathematical_expressions | expression]]: `7(3y - 5) - 2(10 + 4y)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

1.  **Distribute the `7`:**
    *   `7 * 3y = 21y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>
    *   `7 * -5 = -35` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>
    *   The first part becomes `21y - 35` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

2.  **Distribute the `-2` (including the negative sign):**
    *   `-2 * 10 = -20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>
    *   `-2 * 4y = -8y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>
    *   The second part becomes `-20 - 8y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

3.  **Combine the results:**
    *   The full [[mathematical_expressions | expression]] is now `21y - 35 - 20 - 8y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

4.  **Identify and combine like terms:**
    *   **Terms with `y`:** `21y` and `-8y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>
        *   `21y - 8y = 13y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>
    *   **Constant terms:** `-35` and `-20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>
        *   `-35 - 20 = -55` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>

Therefore, the simplified [[mathematical_expressions | expression]] is `13y - 55` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot combine terms that are adding different things, such as `21y` with `-35` or `-20`, because they are not like terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

Solving inequalities that involve absolute values can often be confusing, but understanding the core meaning of absolute value can simplify the process significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The key is to remember that absolute value represents the distance of a number from zero on a number line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Visualizing these concepts on a [[visualizing_inequalities_on_a_number_line | number line]] is crucial for clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## Absolute Value Less Than a Number ($|x| < a$)

When an absolute value inequality is in the form of $|x| < a$ (e.g., $|x| < 12$), it means that *x* must be less than *a* units away from zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Example: $|x| < 12$

To solve $|x| < 12$, we are looking for all values of *x* that are less than 12 units away from 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

1.  **[[Visualizing inequalities on a number line | Visualize on a Number Line]]**:
    *   Draw a number line with 0, positive 12, and negative 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
    *   Any number between -12 and +12 will have an absolute value less than 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
    *   For instance, the absolute value of -6 is 6, which is less than 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

2.  **Formulate the Compound Inequality**:
    *   This translates to *x* being greater than -12 AND *x* being less than 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
    *   This can be written as `-12 < x < 12` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

3.  **[[Interval notation in solving inequalities | Interval Notation]]**:
    *   The solution set can be expressed as `(-12, 12)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

### Example: $|5x + 3| < 7$

Here, the expression `(5x + 3)` must evaluate to a number less than 7 units away from 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

1.  **Formulate the Compound Inequality**:
    *   The term `5x + 3` must be greater than -7 AND less than 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
    *   Written as `-7 < 5x + 3 < 7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

2.  **Solve the Inequality**:
    *   Subtract 3 from all parts: `-10 < 5x < 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
    *   Divide all parts by 5: `-2 < x < 4/5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

3.  **[[Interval notation in solving inequalities | Interval Notation]]**:
    *   The solution set is `(-2, 4/5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

## Absolute Value Greater Than a Number ($|x| > a$)

When an absolute value inequality is in the form of $|x| > a$ (e.g., $|7x| \ge 21$), it means that *x* must be *a* or more units away from zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### Example: $|7x| \ge 21$

This means that `7x` must be 21 or more units away from 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

1.  **[[Visualizing inequalities on a number line | Visualize on a Number Line]]**:
    *   Draw 0, positive 21, and negative 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
    *   Numbers that are 21 or more units away from 0 are:
        *   Those greater than or equal to positive 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
        *   Those less than or equal to negative 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
    *   For example, the absolute value of -30 (which is 30) is greater than 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

2.  **Formulate the Compound Inequality**:
    *   This translates to two separate inequalities connected by "OR":
        *   `7x \le -21` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a> OR `7x \ge 21` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
    *   The logic is that if `7x` is less than negative 21, its absolute value will be greater than 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

3.  **Solve the Inequalities**:
    *   For `7x \le -21`: Divide by 7, resulting in `x \le -3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
    *   For `7x \ge 21`: Divide by 7, resulting in `x \ge 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

4.  **[[Visualizing inequalities on a number line | Graphical Solution]]**:
    *   The solution set is `x \ge 3` OR `x \le -3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
    *   On a number line, this means values to the left of (and including) -3, and values to the right of (and including) 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

### Example: $|2x/7 + 9| > 5/7$

The expression `(2x/7 + 9)` must be more than 5/7 units away from 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

1.  **Formulate the Compound Inequality**:
    *   `2x/7 + 9 > 5/7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a> OR `2x/7 + 9 < -5/7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

2.  **Solve the Inequalities**:
    *   Multiply all terms by 7 to eliminate denominators:
        *   `2x + 63 > 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>
        *   `2x + 63 < -5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>
    *   Subtract 63 from both sides in each inequality:
        *   `2x > -58` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>
        *   `2x < -68` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>
    *   Divide by 2:
        *   `x > -29` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>
        *   `x < -34` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>

3.  **[[Visualizing inequalities on a number line | Graphical Solution]]**:
    *   The solution set is `x > -29` OR `x < -34` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.
    *   On a number line, this means values to the left of -34, and values to the right of -29 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

While rules exist for these forms (e.g., $|f(x)| < a$ implies `-a < f(x) < a` and $|f(x)| > a$ implies `f(x) > a` OR `f(x) < -a`), it is more beneficial to understand the underlying logic of distance from zero rather than simply memorizing formulas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. The [[visualizing_inequalities_on_a_number_line | visualization]] of inequalities on a number line is key to developing this intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

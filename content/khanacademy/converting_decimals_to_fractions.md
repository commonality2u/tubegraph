Converting decimals to fractions can be a straightforward process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

## The Method

To convert a decimal to a fraction, identify the place value of the last significant digit in the decimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. This place value determines the denominator of your initial fraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. The digits of the decimal (without the decimal point) become the numerator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

## Examples

### Example 1: 0.035

To convert 0.035 to a fraction:
*   Identify the place values:
    *   The '0' after the decimal is in the tenths place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
    *   The '3' is in the hundredths place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
    *   The '5' is in the thousandths place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
*   Since the last significant digit is in the thousandths place, the denominator will be 1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
*   The numerator is formed by the digits 35 (ignoring leading zeros), so the fraction is 35/1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

### Example 2: 0.030

To convert 0.030 to a fraction:
*   One way is to note that the last digit is in the thousandths place, making it 30/1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   Alternatively, recognize that 0.030 is the same as 0.03 because trailing zeros after the last non-zero digit do not change the value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   If we consider 0.03, the last significant digit is in the hundredths place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. This means the fraction is 3/100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   Both 30/1,000 and 3/100 are equivalent; dividing both the numerator and denominator of 30/1,000 by 10 yields 3/100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

## Simplifying the Fraction

After converting to an initial fraction, it's often necessary to [[simplifying_fractions|simplify the fraction]] to its lowest terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

For 35/1,000:
*   Both 35 and 1,000 can be divided by 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   35 divided by 5 is 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   1,000 divided by 5 is 200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   The simplified fraction is 7/200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

> [!tip] Verification
> You can verify your conversion by converting the resulting fraction back into a decimal using division. For example, 7/200 should equal 0.035 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

Converting a decimal into a fraction is generally considered a straightforward process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

## Method
The method involves identifying the place value of the last significant digit in the decimal. This place value then dictates the denominator of the initial fractional representation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

1.  **Identify Place Value**: Determine the place value of the last non-zero digit after the decimal point (e.g., tenths, hundredths, thousandths) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
2.  **Form the Fraction**: Write the digits of the decimal (without the decimal point) as the numerator. The denominator will be 1 followed by as many zeros as there are decimal places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
3.  **[[Simplifying fractions | Simplify]]**: Once the initial fraction is formed, it should be [[Simplifying fractions | simplified to its lowest terms]] by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

## Examples

### Example 1: 0.035
To convert 0.035 to a fraction:
*   The last significant digit (5) is in the thousandths place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   This means there are three decimal places of significance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   Write the digits as the numerator (35) and the denominator as 1,000 (for thousandths) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
    *   0.035 = 35/1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>
*   [[Simplifying fractions | Simplify]] the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
    *   35 รท 5 = 7
    *   1,000 รท 5 = 200
    *   Therefore, 0.035 = 7/200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
*   To verify, [[Converting fractions to decimals | converting 7/200 back to a decimal]] should yield 0.035 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

### Example 2: 0.030 and 0.03
Consider 0.030:
*   While the 0 is in the thousandths place, 0.030 is equivalent to 0.03 because the trailing zero does not add value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   If we consider 0.030 as is, it can be written as 30/1,000 (thousandths place) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
*   If we consider 0.03, the last significant digit (3) is in the hundredths place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   This means it can be written as 3/100 (hundredths place) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   Both 30/1,000 and 3/100 are equivalent; dividing both the numerator and denominator of 30/1,000 by 10 results in 3/100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

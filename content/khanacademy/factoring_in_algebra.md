[[Factoring in algebra | Factoring]] rational expressions is similar to simplifying fractions or [[understanding_rational_numbers | rational numbers]] by putting them in lowest terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Just as with fractions like 3/6, where 3 and 6 share a common factor (3) that can be cancelled to get 1/2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, the same principle applies to rational expressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

The key difference is that rational expressions involve numerators and denominators that are [[understanding_algebraic_expressions | expressions involving variables]] instead of just numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## How to Factor Rational Expressions

The process involves [[stepbystep_algebraic_simplification | factoring]] both the numerator and the denominator to identify and cancel out any common factors.

### Example 1: Factoring Common Monomials

Consider the expression: `(9x + 3) / (12x + 4)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>

*   **Step 1: Factor the numerator**
    The numerator `9x + 3` can have a common factor of 3 factored out: `3(3x + 1)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   **Step 2: Factor the denominator**
    The denominator `12x + 4` can have a common factor of 4 factored out: `4(3x + 1)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
*   **Step 3: Rewrite the expression and cancel common factors**
    The expression becomes `(3(3x + 1)) / (4(3x + 1))` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
    The common factor `(3x + 1)` can be cancelled out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
    The simplified expression is `3/4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

### Example 2: Factoring Differences of Squares

Consider the expression: `(x² - 9) / (5x + 15)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>

*   **Step 1: Factor the numerator**
    The numerator `x² - 9` is a [[factoring_quadratic_expressions | difference of squares]], which factors into `(x + 3)(x - 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Step 2: Factor the denominator**
    The denominator `5x + 15` can have a common factor of 5 factored out: `5(x + 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   **Step 3: Rewrite and cancel**
    The expression becomes `((x + 3)(x - 3)) / (5(x + 3))` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
    The common factor `(x + 3)` cancels out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
    The simplified expression is `(x - 3) / 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

### Example 3: Factoring Quadratic Trinomials (Leading Coefficient 1)

Consider the expression: `(x² + 6x + 5) / (x² - x - 2)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>

*   **Step 1: Factor the numerator**
    For `x² + 6x + 5`, find two numbers that multiply to 5 and add to 6. These are 5 and 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
    So, `x² + 6x + 5` factors into `(x + 5)(x + 1)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
*   **Step 2: Factor the denominator**
    For `x² - x - 2`, find two numbers that multiply to -2 and add to -1. These are -2 and 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
    So, `x² - x - 2` factors into `(x - 2)(x + 1)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
*   **Step 3: Rewrite and cancel**
    The expression becomes `((x + 5)(x + 1)) / ((x - 2)(x + 1))` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
    The common factor `(x + 1)` cancels out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
    The simplified expression is `(x + 5) / (x - 2)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

### Example 4: Factoring Quadratic Trinomials (Leading Coefficient Not 1) using Grouping

Consider the expression: `(3x² + 3x - 18) / (2x² + 5x - 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>

*   **Step 1: Factor the numerator `3x² + 3x - 18`**
    *   Use the [[factoring_by_grouping_technique | factoring by grouping technique]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Find two numbers that multiply to `3 * -18 = -54` and add to `3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. These numbers are 9 and -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
    *   Rewrite `3x` as `9x - 6x`: `3x² + 9x - 6x - 18` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
    *   Group terms: `(3x² + 9x) - (6x + 18)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
    *   Factor common terms from each group: `3x(x + 3) - 6(x + 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
    *   Factor out the common binomial `(x + 3)`: `(3x - 6)(x + 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
*   **Step 2: Factor the denominator `2x² + 5x - 3`**
    *   Use [[factoring_by_grouping_technique | grouping]]. Find two numbers that multiply to `2 * -3 = -6` and add to `5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. These numbers are 6 and -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.
    *   Rewrite `5x` as `6x - x`: `2x² + 6x - x - 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.
    *   Group terms: `(2x² + 6x) - (x + 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.
    *   Factor common terms from each group: `2x(x + 3) - 1(x + 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.
    *   Factor out the common binomial `(x + 3)`: `(2x - 1)(x + 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.
*   **Step 3: Rewrite and cancel**
    The expression becomes `((3x - 6)(x + 3)) / ((2x - 1)(x + 3))` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.
    The common factor `(x + 3)` cancels out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.
    The simplified expression is `(3x - 6) / (2x - 1)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

## Important Condition: Excluded Values

When simplifying rational expressions, it is crucial to state the values of `x` that would make the **original denominator** equal to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. These values must be excluded from the domain of the simplified expression to ensure it remains equivalent to the original <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

*   In Example 1, the original denominator was `12x + 4`. If `12x + 4 = 0`, then `12x = -4`, and `x = -1/3`. Therefore, the simplified expression `3/4` is only equivalent if `x ≠ -1/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   In Example 2, the original denominator was `5x + 15`. If `5x + 15 = 0`, then `5x = -15`, and `x = -3`. So, `(x - 3) / 5` is equivalent only if `x ≠ -3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   In Example 3, the original denominator was `x² - x - 2`, which factored to `(x - 2)(x + 1)`. If `(x - 2)(x + 1) = 0`, then `x = 2` or `x = -1`. Thus, `(x + 5) / (x - 2)` is equivalent only if `x ≠ -1` and `x ≠ 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. (The video only explicitly mentions `x ≠ -1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>).
*   In Example 4, the original denominator was `2x² + 5x - 3`, which factored to `(2x - 1)(x + 3)`. If `(2x - 1)(x + 3) = 0`, then `x = 1/2` or `x = -3`. Therefore, `(3x - 6) / (2x - 1)` is equivalent only if `x ≠ -3` and `x ≠ 1/2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. (The video only explicitly mentions `x ≠ -3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>).

```ad-note
The simplified expression is NOT equivalent to the original expression at the values of `x` that made the original denominator zero, even if the simplified expression is defined at those points. Adding the exclusion condition makes the expressions truly equivalent.

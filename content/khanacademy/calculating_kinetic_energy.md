The concepts of work and energy are fundamental in physics, though their verbal definitions can be somewhat circular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. [[concept_of_work_in_physics | Work]] is defined as energy transferred by a force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, while energy is described as the ability to do work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. To gain a more quantitative understanding, it is helpful to look at the equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## Work in Mechanics

In mechanics, work is defined as force multiplied by distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
Work ($W$) = Force ($F$) Ã— Distance ($d$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>

For example, applying a force of 10 Newtons to move a block 7 meters results in 70 Newton-meters of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. The unit for work (and energy) is the Joule (J), where one Newton-meter equals one Joule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This [[mathematical_representation_of_work | mathematical representation of work]] helps in understanding the [[concept_of_work_in_physics | concept of work in physics]] and the [[relation_between_work_and_energy | relation between work and energy]].

## Derivation of Kinetic Energy

Consider a block of mass ($m$) starting at rest and accelerated by a force ($F$) over a distance ($d$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. As the force causes acceleration (since F = ma), the block will have a final velocity ($v_f$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

To determine the final velocity, we use a kinematic equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>:
$v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2ad$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>

Since the block starts at rest, the initial velocity ($v_i$) is 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>:
$v_f^2 = 2ad$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>

From Newton's second law, acceleration ($a$) can be expressed as force ($F$) divided by mass ($m$) ($a = F/m$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>:
$v_f^2 = 2 \left(\frac{F}{m}\right) d$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>

We can rearrange this equation to see the term for work ($F \times d$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>:
$v_f^2 = 2 \frac{(Fd)}{m}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>

Substitute `Work` for `(Fd)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>:
$v_f^2 = \frac{2 \times \text{Work}}{m}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>

Multiplying both sides by $m$ gives:
$m v_f^2 = 2 \times \text{Work}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>

Dividing both sides by 2 yields the formula for work in terms of mass and velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>:
$\text{Work} = \frac{1}{2} m v_f^2$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>

## Kinetic Energy Formula

This derived formula, $\frac{1}{2} m v^2$, is defined as **kinetic energy** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Kinetic energy represents the energy an object possesses due to its motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>, or the work required to accelerate an object from rest to its current velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

The formula for calculating kinetic energy ($KE$) is:
$KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>

Where:
*   $KE$ is kinetic energy (in Joules)
*   $m$ is the mass of the object (in kilograms)
*   $v$ is the velocity of the object (in meters per second)

This formula is very common in physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. Understanding kinetic energy is crucial for comprehending how different forms of energy convert into each other, a concept further explored in the law of conservation of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

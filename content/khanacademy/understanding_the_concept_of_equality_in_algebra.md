When solving algebraic equations, the fundamental principle is that both sides of an equation must always remain equal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:22">[01:38:22]</a>. This means any operation performed on one side of the equation must also be performed on the other side to maintain the equality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:02">[01:40:02]</a>. This concept is central to [[equivalent_transformations_in_algebra | equivalent transformations]] in algebra, which allow you to manipulate equations while preserving their truth.

## Solving More Complex Equations

Consider an equation that is slightly more complicated than simple single-variable equations.

### Example 1: `3x + 5 = 17`

Let's analyze the equation `3x + 5 = 17` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Unlike simpler equations, this one includes an additional constant term (+5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

#### Visualizing the Equation

To understand what the equation is saying, it can be visualized tangibly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>:
*   `3x` can be represented as three separate `x` objects (x + x + x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   `+ 5` can be represented as five individual objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   The right side, `17`, is represented by seventeen individual objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

The goal is to isolate the variable `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

#### Eliminating the Constant Term

To simplify the left side of the equation to just `3x`, the `+5` needs to be removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.
*   **Action:** Subtract 5 from the left-hand side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. In a tangible sense, this means removing five objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.
*   **Maintaining Equality:** To keep the equation balanced, you must also subtract 5 from the right-hand side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

```
3x + 5 - 5 = 17 - 5
```
*   On the left, `+5` and `-5` cancel out, leaving `3x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.
*   On the right, `17 - 5` equals `12` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>.

This simplifies the equation to:
```
3x = 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>
```

#### Isolating the Variable

Now that the equation is in a simpler form, the next step is to isolate `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>.
*   **Action:** Divide both sides of the equation by 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.
*   **Maintaining Equality:** As with subtraction, division must be applied to both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.

```
3x / 3 = 12 / 3
```
*   On the left, `3x` divided by `3` leaves `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.
*   On the right, `12` divided by `3` equals `4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.

The solution is:
```
x = 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>
```

### Example 2: `7x - 2 = -10`

This example introduces negative numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>, but the same [[algebraic_techniques_for_solving_equations | algebraic techniques for solving equations]] apply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.

#### Eliminating the Constant Term

To get `7x` alone on the left side, the `-2` needs to be eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>.
*   **Action:** Add 2 to the left-hand side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>.
*   **Maintaining Equality:** Add 2 to the right-hand side as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>.

```
7x - 2 + 2 = -10 + 2
```
*   On the left, `-2 + 2` is `0`, leaving `7x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>.
*   On the right, `-10 + 2` is `-8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>. When adding a positive number to a negative number, you move to the right on a number line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.

This simplifies the equation to:
```
7x = -8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>
```

#### Isolating the Variable

*   **Action:** Divide both sides by 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>.
*   **Maintaining Equality:** Divide the right-hand side by 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>.

```
7x / 7 = -8 / 7
```
*   On the left, `7x` divided by `7` leaves `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>.
*   On the right, `-8` divided by `7` results in `-8/7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>.

The solution can be expressed as a fraction or a mixed number:
```
x = -8/7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>
OR
x = -1 and 1/7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>
```

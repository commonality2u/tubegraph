A function can be understood as an abstract concept that takes an input, processes it, and then produces a specific output based on that input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14"></a>.

## Defining a Function

Typically, a function is denoted with a letter like 'f', and its input variable is often 'x', resulting in the notation f(x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31"></a>. However, any letters can be used for the function name and its input, such as h(a) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27"></a>. The input variable acts as a placeholder that gets replaced by the specific value being processed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19"></a>.

### Examples of Functions

Functions can be defined in various ways, from standard mathematical expressions to more abstract rules.

#### Conditional Function
A function can operate based on specific conditions for its input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41"></a>.
For example, consider the function f(x) defined as:
*   f(x) = x² if x is even <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41"></a>
*   f(x) = x + 5 if x is odd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48"></a>

To [[evaluating_functions | evaluate]] this function:
*   f(2): Since 2 is even, f(2) = 2² = 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31"></a>.
*   f(3): Since 3 is odd, f(3) = 3 + 5 = 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57"></a>.

#### Abstract Rule Function
Functions can also be defined by more unusual rules, demonstrating their general applicability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37"></a>.
For instance, a function h(a) could be defined as "the next largest number that starts with the same letter as variable a" (assuming English numbers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00"></a>.
*   h(2): Since "Two" starts with 'T', the next largest number starting with 'T' is "Three" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12"></a>. So, h(2) = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14"></a>.
*   h(8): Since "Eight" starts with 'E', the next largest number starting with 'E' is "Eleven" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31"></a>. So, h(8) = 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37"></a>.

#### Linear Equation as a Function
Many common mathematical expressions you may have encountered are functions. For example, the equation y = x + 1 can be viewed as a function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02"></a>. This can be rewritten in function notation as y = f(x) = x + 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07"></a>.
To [[evaluating_functions | evaluate]] this function:
*   If x is 0, f(0) = 0 + 1 = 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26"></a>.
*   If x is 2, f(2) = 2 + 1 = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44"></a>.
This relationship can also be represented using a table, mapping x values to their corresponding y values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48"></a>. The function notation clarifies that the function takes an input (x), processes it (adds 1), and produces an output that is one more than the input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26"></a>.

## What is Not a Function?

The fundamental rule for a [[definition_of_a_function | function]] is that for every given input, there can only be *one* possible output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39"></a>. If an input can lead to multiple outputs, the relationship is not a function.

Consider the equation of a circle: x² + y² = 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28"></a>. This represents a circle centered at the origin with a radius of 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15"></a>.

This relationship between x and y is *not* a function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47"></a>.
*   If we pick an x-value, for instance, x = 1, there are two possible y-values associated with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57"></a>.
*   Substituting x = 1 into the equation:
    1² + y² = 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06"></a>
    1 + y² = 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07"></a>
    y² = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11"></a>
    y = ±√3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15"></a>
Since an input of 1 yields two outputs (positive √3 and negative √3), this relationship is not a function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47"></a>.

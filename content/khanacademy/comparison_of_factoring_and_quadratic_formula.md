The [[introduction_to_the_quadratic_formula | quadratic formula]] is considered one of the most useful formulas in mathematics for [[solving_quadratic_equations | solving quadratic equations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. While memorization of the formula is recommended, it's also important to understand its derivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The formula itself is derived from [[difference_between_completing_the_square_and_factoring | completing the square]] on a general [[understanding_components_of_a_quadratic_equation | quadratic equation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Understanding the Quadratic Formula

The primary purpose of the [[introduction_to_the_quadratic_formula | quadratic formula]] is to [[solving_quadratic_equations_using_the_quadratic_formula | solve for the roots]], or zeroes, of [[understanding_components_of_a_quadratic_equation | quadratic equations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

A general [[understanding_components_of_a_quadratic_equation | quadratic equation]] is expressed in the form:
$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>

Here, $a$ is the coefficient of the $x^2$ term, $b$ is the coefficient of the $x$ term, and $c$ is the constant term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

The [[introduction_to_the_quadratic_formula | quadratic formula]] states that the solutions for $x$ are:
$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>

## [[methods_for_solving_quadratic_equations | Solving Quadratic Equations]]: [[factoring_quadratics | Factoring]] vs. Quadratic Formula

Both [[factoring_quadratic_equations | factoring]] and the [[introduction_to_the_quadratic_formula | quadratic formula]] are [[methods_for_solving_quadratic_equations | methods for solving quadratic equations]], but they each have their strengths.

### Cases where both methods apply
Consider the equation $x^2 + 4x - 21 = 0$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

Using the [[introduction_to_the_quadratic_formula | quadratic formula]], we identify $a=1$, $b=4$, and $c=-21$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
Plugging these values into the formula:
$x = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{4^2 - 4(1)(-21)}}{2(1)}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>
$x = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>
$x = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>
$x = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>
This yields two solutions:
$x = \frac{-4 + 10}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>
$x = \frac{-4 - 10}{2} = \frac{-14}{2} = -7$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>

Alternatively, by [[factoring_quadratic_equations | factoring]] the equation $x^2 + 4x - 21 = 0$:
We look for two numbers whose product is -21 and whose sum is 4. These numbers are 7 and -3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
So, the factored form is $(x+7)(x-3) = 0$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
This gives the solutions:
$x+7 = 0 \implies x = -7$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>
$x-3 = 0 \implies x = 3$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>

In this example, both methods yield the same correct answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. For simpler equations, [[factoring_quadratics | factoring]] might be quicker.

### When the Quadratic Formula is Preferred

The [[introduction_to_the_quadratic_formula | quadratic formula]] is particularly advantageous for problems that are "hard to factor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. It provides a universal approach to [[solving_quadratic_equations | solving any quadratic equation]], regardless of whether it can be easily factored into integer or rational roots.

Consider the equation $3x^2 + 6x + 10 = 0$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
Here, $a=3$, $b=6$, and $c=10$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
Plugging into the formula:
$x = \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{6^2 - 4(3)(10)}}{2(3)}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>
$x = \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 120}}{6}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>
$x = \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{-84}}{6}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>

Notice the square root of a negative number. This indicates that there are **no real solutions** for $x$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. When the term $b^2 - 4ac$ (known as the discriminant) is negative, the quadratic equation does not intersect the x-axis, meaning no real roots exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. While imaginary numbers can be used to express these solutions, for real number contexts, it signifies no solution. This concept is crucial in the [[applications_of_the_quadratic_formula_in_solving_complex_equations | applications of the quadratic formula in solving complex equations]].

The quadratic formula effectively handles all scenarios, including those without real solutions or those with irrational solutions that are difficult to find through [[factoring_quadratic_equations | factoring]].

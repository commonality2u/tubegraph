Photosynthesis is one of the most important biological processes on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Without it, life as we know it would likely not exist, as there would be no source of food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Overview of the Process

Plants, bacteria, and algae perform [[photosynthesis_process_overview|photosynthesis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. In simple terms, it's the process by which these organisms take carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight and convert them into sugars (carbohydrates) and oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

The general [[photosynthesis_chemical_equation|chemical equation for photosynthesis]] is:
Carbon Dioxide + Water + Photons (Sunlight) → Carbohydrate (e.g., CH₂O) + Oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>

## Critical Outputs for Life

The two primary outputs of [[photosynthesis_process_overview|photosynthesis]] have profound importance for living species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>:

### 1. Carbohydrates and Sugars

Carbohydrates and sugars are essential for fueling our bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. For instance, glucose, a simple carbohydrate, is broken down in [[introduction_to_cellular_respiration|cellular respiration]] to generate [[role_of_atp_and_nadph_in_photosynthesis|ATP]], the cellular currency of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Photosynthesis provides the basic fuel (carbohydrates) that is then used as the energy source for all other important compounds we consume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. It serves as the ultimate source of fuel for animals, either directly by consuming plants or indirectly through the consumption of animals that eat plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### 2. Oxygen

The oxygen produced by photosynthesis is crucial for life, especially for organisms that breathe oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Oxygen is necessary for organisms to break down glucose and perform [[introduction_to_cellular_respiration|cellular respiration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Harnessing Sunlight

Photosynthesis allows organisms, primarily plants, bacteria, and algae, to harness the energy from sunlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Photons from the sun, traveling millions of miles, are captured and converted into sugars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This process of converting light energy into chemical energy in the form of sugars is fundamental to the energy flow of nearly all ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

## Stages of Photosynthesis

[[photosynthesis_process_overview|Photosynthesis]] is generally broken down into two main stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>:

1.  **[[lightdependent_and_lightindependent_reactions|Light-Dependent Reactions]]**: These reactions require sunlight (photons) to occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Water is taken in, and molecular oxygen is released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. The light reactions also produce [[role_of_atp_and_nadph_in_photosynthesis|ATP]] and [[role_of_atp_and_nadph_in_photosynthesis|NADPH]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. These high-energy molecules are crucial for the next stage.
2.  **[[lightdependent_and_lightindependent_reactions|Light-Independent Reactions]] (Dark Reactions/Calvin Cycle)**: These reactions do not directly require photons, though they can occur when the sun is out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. They utilize the [[role_of_atp_and_nadph_in_photosynthesis|ATP]] and [[role_of_atp_and_nadph_in_photosynthesis|NADPH]] produced during the light reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. Carbon dioxide is taken in and converted into a basic building block for other carbohydrates, such as phosphoglyceraldehyde (PGAL) or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. Two G3P molecules can then be used to produce glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

Photosynthesis is one of the most vital biological processes on Earth. Without it, life as we know it would likely not exist, as it provides the fundamental basis for food and the oxygen we breathe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This process is primarily associated with plants, but also occurs in bacteria and algae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Core Process and Outputs

At its simplest, [[photosynthesis_equation_and_process | photosynthesis]] involves plants taking carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight to produce sugars (carbohydrates) and oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

### Carbohydrates (Sugars)
Carbohydrates are essential for fueling our bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. In [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | cellular respiration]], glucose (a broken-down carbohydrate) is used to generate [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]], which is the body's energy currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Photosynthesis is the initial source of this fuel for all life forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

### Oxygen
The oxygen produced during photosynthesis is crucial for life, especially for species that breathe oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Oxygen is necessary for [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | cellular respiration]] to break down glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Harnessing Sunlight Energy

One of the most remarkable aspects of photosynthesis is its ability to harness sunlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Photons released from fusion reactions in the sun travel to Earth, and plants, bacteria, and algae capture this energy to convert it into sugars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. These sugars then serve as the primary energy source for all life, whether directly consumed (like a potato) or indirectly through other animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## General Equation of Photosynthesis

The general scientific equation for [[photosynthesis_equation_and_process | photosynthesis]] is:
`n CO₂ + n H₂O + Photons → (CH₂O)n + n O₂` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>

Here, (CH₂O)n represents a carbohydrate, where 'n' is typically at least three, and is six for glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

## Stages of Photosynthesis

Photosynthesis is divided into two main stages:

### [[lightdependent_and_lightindependent_reactions | Light-Dependent Reactions]]
These reactions require sunlight (photons) to occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. During this stage, water (H₂O) is taken in, and molecular oxygen (O₂) is released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. The [[lightdependent_and_lightindependent_reactions | light-dependent reactions]] also produce [[role_of_atp_and_nadph_in_photosynthesis | ATP]] and [[role_of_atp_and_nadph_in_photosynthesis | NADPH]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

### [[lightdependent_and_lightindependent_reactions | Light-Independent Reactions]] (Dark Reactions/Calvin Cycle)
Although often called "dark reactions," these processes also occur in the light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. They are termed [[lightdependent_and_lightindependent_reactions | light-independent]] because they do not directly require photons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. This stage, commonly known as the [[calvin_cycle_and_carbohydrate_production | Calvin Cycle]], utilizes the [[role_of_atp_and_nadph_in_photosynthesis | ATP]] and [[role_of_atp_and_nadph_in_photosynthesis | NADPH]] produced in the light reactions, along with carbon dioxide (CO₂), to synthesize carbohydrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. The direct product is phosphoglyceraldehyde (PGAL) or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Two molecules of PGAL can then be used to produce glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. This process essentially builds glucose, in contrast to [[impact_of_glycolysis_in_cellular_respiration | glycolysis]] which splits glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

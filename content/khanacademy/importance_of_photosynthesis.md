Photosynthesis is one of the most vital biological processes on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Without it, life as we know it would likely not exist, as there would be no source of food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This process is primarily associated with plants, but also occurs in bacteria and algae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

### Fundamental Process
In simple terms, [[basic_concept_of_photosynthesis | photosynthesis]] is the process plants use to combine carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight to produce sugars (carbohydrates) and oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. The general equation for this process can be represented as:
`n CO₂ + n H₂O + Photons → (CH₂O)n (Carbohydrate) + n O₂` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>

### Crucial Products for Life
The two main products of [[basic_concept_of_photosynthesis | photosynthesis]] have profound significance for living species, especially those that breathe oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>:

#### Carbohydrates/Sugars
Plants convert light energy into chemical energy stored in sugars, which serve as the primary fuel for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Fuel for Bodies**: Organisms, including humans, require carbohydrates or sugars to power their bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Energy Production**: Through [[cellular_respiration_process | cellular respiration]], [[role_of_glucose_in_energy_production | glucose]] (a simplified carbohydrate) is broken down to generate ATP, which is the biological currency of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

#### Oxygen
The oxygen produced during [[basic_concept_of_photosynthesis | photosynthesis]] is equally critical.
*   **Respiration**: Oxygen is essential for organisms to break down [[role_of_glucose_in_energy_production | glucose]] and perform [[cellular_respiration_process | cellular respiration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### Energy Harnessing
[[basic_concept_of_photosynthesis | Photosynthesis]] is remarkable because it allows organisms, predominantly plants, to harness direct sunlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Photons released from fusion reactions in the sun travel vast distances to Earth, where plants, bacteria, and algae capture this energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This harnessed energy is then converted into sugars, which can be directly consumed or enter the food chain via other animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. This means [[basic_concept_of_photosynthesis | photosynthesis]] is the fundamental source of fuel for all animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

### Stages of Photosynthesis
[[detailed_process_of_photosynthesis | Photosynthesis]] can be broken down into two main stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>:

*   **[[lightdependent_and_lightindependent_reactions | Light-Dependent Reactions]]**: These reactions require sunlight (photons) to occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Water is taken in, and oxygen is released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. They produce ATP (cellular energy currency) and NADPH, which is a reducing agent that carries high-energy electrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   **[[lightdependent_and_lightindependent_reactions | Light-Independent Reactions]] (or Dark Reactions / [[calvin_cycle_and_carbohydrate_production | Calvin Cycle]])**: While often called "dark reactions," they occur when the sun is out, but do not directly depend on photons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Instead, they utilize the ATP and NADPH produced by the light reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. Carbon dioxide is also consumed in this stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. The [[calvin_cycle_and_carbohydrate_production | Calvin Cycle]] ultimately produces phosphoglyceraldehyde (PGAL or G3P), a three-carbon molecule that serves as a building block for other carbohydrates, including [[role_of_glucose_in_energy_production | glucose]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. This molecule is the inverse of the first product obtained when [[role_of_glucose_in_energy_production | glucose]] is split during glycolysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.

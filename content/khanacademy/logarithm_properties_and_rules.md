## Introduction to Logarithms
A [[logarithm_notation | logarithm]] is presented as the inverse of taking the exponent of something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The word "logarithm" itself is often misspelled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Relationship Between Logarithms and Exponents
The core [[relationship_between_exponents_and_logarithms | relationship between exponents and logarithms]] is defined as follows:
If `b^y = x`, then `log base b of x = y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
This means that a logarithm answers the question: "To what power must `b` be raised to get `x`?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. The result of a logarithm expression is the exponent that `b` would be raised to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## Evaluating Logarithmic Expressions
### [[examples_of_logarithmic_calculations | Examples of Logarithmic Calculations]]
Here are several examples demonstrating how to [[evaluating_logarithmic_expressions | evaluate logarithmic expressions]]:

*   **Example 1:** If `2^3 = 8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, then `log base 2 of 8 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This asks, "2 to what power equals 8?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>

*   **Example 2:** `log base 4 of 64 = x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This is equivalent to `4^x = 64` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Since `4^3 = 64` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, then `x = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

*   **Example 3 (Common Base):** `log base 10 of 1,000,000` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. This asks, "10 to what power equals 1,000,000?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Since `10^6 = 1,000,000` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>, then `log base 10 of 1,000,000 = 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. This result, 6, is the exponent needed for 10 to reach 1,000,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

*   **Example 4 (Fractional Base and Argument):** `log base 1/2 of 1/8 = x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. This means `(1/2)^x = 1/8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. Since `(1/2)^3 = 1/8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, then `x = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

*   **Example 5 (Finding the Base):** `log base x of 27 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This translates to `x^3 = 27` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Taking the cubed root of 27 gives `x = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. So, `log base 3 of 27 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

## [[special_cases_in_logarithms | Special Cases in Logarithms]] (Implied Properties)

Certain scenarios illustrate specific rules or properties of logarithms:

### Logarithm of One
*   `log base 100 of 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. This asks, "100 to what power equals 1?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Any non-zero number raised to the 0th power is equal to 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Therefore, `100^0 = 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>, so `log base 100 of 1 = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

### Logarithm of Zero (Undefined)
*   `log base 2 of 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This asks, "2 to what power equals 0?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. There is no real number `x` for which `2^x = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Thus, `log base 2 of 0` is undefined or has no solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

### Logarithm of a Negative Number (Undefined)
*   `log base 3 of -1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This asks, "3 to what power equals -1?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Assuming real numbers, there is no number one can raise 3 to that results in a negative number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Hence, `log base 3 of -1` is undefined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   For a logarithm to be defined, the number being logged (the argument) must be greater than 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. It cannot be zero or negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

### Logarithms and Negative Exponents
*   `log base 8 of 1/64` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. Since `8^2 = 64` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, this problem asks, "8 to what power equals 1/64?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. From the rules of negative exponents, `8^-2` is equivalent to `1/(8^2)` or `1/64` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. Therefore, `log base 8 of 1/64 = -2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. When the inverse of the number is taken, the logarithm's answer becomes negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

More complex properties of [[logarithm_notation | logarithms]] will be explored in future modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

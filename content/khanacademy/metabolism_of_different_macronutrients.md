Cellular respiration is a fundamental process that converts energy from nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary energy currency of the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. While glucose is a common starting point, cells can catabolize other macronutrients like proteins and fats to produce ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.

## Glucose Metabolism

The breakdown of glucose (a 6-carbon molecule) proceeds through several [[Cellular respiration phases | phases]]:

### Glycolysis

[[ATP production and consumption in glycolysis | Glycolysis]] is the initial step, occurring in the cytoplasm of the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>. This process literally "lyses" (splits) a glucose molecule in half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>.

*   **Inputs**: One glucose molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
*   **Outputs**: Two 3-carbon pyruvic acid (pyruvate) molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.
*   **Energy Yield**: A net payoff of two ATP molecules (two are used in an investment stage, and four are generated) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, and two NADH molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.
*   **Oxygen Dependence**: [[ATP production and consumption in glycolysis | Glycolysis]] does not require oxygen and can occur in its presence or absence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:02">[00:54:02]</a>.

### Pyruvate Oxidation (Preparatory Step)

Before entering the [[Krebs Cycle]], pyruvate undergoes an oxidation step, which takes place in the matrix (inner compartment) of the mitochondria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

*   **Process**: Each 3-carbon pyruvate molecule is cleaved, releasing one carbon as CO2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:01">[04:17:01]</a>. The remaining 2-carbon compound is called acetyl-CoA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.
*   **Energy Yield**: For each pyruvate, one NADH is produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. Since two pyruvates are formed from one glucose, this step yields a total of two NADH molecules per glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>.
*   **Location**: This preparatory step occurs within the mitochondrial matrix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

### The [[Krebs Cycle]] (Citric Acid Cycle)

The [[Krebs Cycle]] is a central part of aerobic respiration, also occurring in the mitochondrial matrix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. All reactions in the [[Krebs Cycle]] are catalyzed by enzymes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.

*   **Initiation**: Acetyl-CoA (2-carbon) merges with oxaloacetic acid (4-carbon) to form citrate (6-carbon), also known as citric acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>.
*   **Cyclical Oxidation**: The citrate is then oxidized over a series of steps, with carbons being cleaved off as CO2, eventually regenerating oxaloacetic acid to continue the cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>.
*   **Energy Yield per Cycle (per Acetyl-CoA)**:
    *   3 NADH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>
    *   1 ATP (or GTP, which can be converted to ATP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>
    *   1 FADH2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>
*   **Total Energy Yield per Glucose**: Since two acetyl-CoA molecules enter the cycle per glucose, the total yield from the [[Krebs Cycle]] is:
    *   6 NADH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>
    *   2 ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>
    *   2 FADH2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>

### Overall Energy Summary from Glucose (Pre-Electron Transport Chain)

Combining the outputs from [[ATP production and consumption in glycolysis | glycolysis]], [[Krebs cycle and pyruvate oxidation | pyruvate oxidation]], and the [[Krebs Cycle]] for one glucose molecule:

*   **Direct ATP**: 2 (from glycolysis) + 2 (from Krebs cycle) = 4 ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>
*   **NADH**: 2 (from glycolysis) + 2 (from pyruvate oxidation) + 6 (from Krebs cycle) = 10 NADH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>
*   **FADH2**: 2 (from Krebs cycle) = 2 FADH2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>
*   **Carbon Dioxide**: 6 CO2 (2 from pyruvate oxidation, 4 from Krebs cycle) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>

The NADH and FADH2 molecules are crucial for the electron transport chain, where the bulk of ATP is produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. Each NADH typically yields three ATPs, and each FADH2 yields two ATPs in the electron transport chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.

Thus, the theoretical maximum ATP yield from one glucose molecule is:
4 (direct ATP) + (10 NADH x 3 ATP/NADH) + (2 FADH2 x 2 ATP/FADH2) = 4 + 30 + 4 = 38 ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.
*This theoretical maximum is a good number for introductory biology courses, although actual cellular efficiency may vary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.*

## Metabolism of Other Macronutrients

The body is not limited to using carbohydrates for energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. Proteins and fats can also be catabolized to produce ATP:

*   **Proteins**: Proteins can be broken down into amino acids, which can then be converted into acetyl-CoA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.
*   **Fats**: Fats can be converted into glucose in the liver, which can then enter glycolysis, or directly into acetyl-CoA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

The significant point is that [[Krebs Cycle | the Krebs cycle]] serves as the entry point for the catabolism of these other macronutrients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. Acetyl-CoA acts as a general catabolic intermediary, allowing the body to generate ATP from carbohydrates, proteins, or fats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

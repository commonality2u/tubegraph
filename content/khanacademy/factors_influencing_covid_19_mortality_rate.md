The estimated mortality rate is a crucial component in [[estimating_actual_covid_19_cases_based_on_deaths | estimating the actual new COVID-19 cases]] in a given area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. This estimation is based on [[analysis_of_covid_19_data_from_hubei_province | analysis by Thomas Pueyo]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Assumed Mortality Rate for Estimations
For the purpose of calculating actual case numbers from death tolls, a 1% mortality rate is often assumed, as it appears to be a reasonable estimate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. However, reported mortality rates vary significantly:
*   **Low end**: As low as 0.6% in South Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   **High end**: As high as approximately 5% in places like Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

## Key Factors Influencing Mortality Rate

### Hospital System Capacity
A significant factor affecting the observed mortality rate is the capacity of the healthcare system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. Higher mortality numbers are typically observed in regions where the hospital system becomes overwhelmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Conversely, maintaining social isolation and taking proper precautions can reduce the spread rate, preventing the hospital system from being overwhelmed and thus helping to keep the mortality rate as low as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. If precautions are not taken and the hospital system is overwhelmed, the mortality rate is likely to increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

### Adequacy of Testing
Lower reported mortality rates (e.g., 0.6%) might not fully account for all potential fatalities from existing cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. The [[difference_between_confirmed_and_actual_covid_19_cases | actual number of cases]] is likely far larger than the number of confirmed cases due to limited testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, especially in places like the United States where testing efforts were initially low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This underreporting of total cases can skew the *perceived* mortality rate if calculated solely on confirmed cases.

## Time from Infection to Death
To estimate the actual number of cases based on deaths, it's necessary to consider the average time from infection to death in those who unfortunately pass away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. This period is estimated to be approximately 20 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. This 20-day period can be broken down as:
*   **Infection to Symptoms**: Approximately 5 days for the incubation period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   **Symptoms to Death**: Approximately 15 additional days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

This means that a reported death today likely corresponds to an infection that occurred about 20 days prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. If a 1% mortality rate is assumed, one death today implies that approximately 100 people were infected 20 days ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

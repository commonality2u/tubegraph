Solving an equation involves [[systematic_approach_to_solving_equations | systematically performing operations]] on both sides to isolate the variable, often `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Once `x` is isolated (e.g., `x = something`), the equation is solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This process relies on understanding that any operation performed on one side of the equation must also be performed on the other side to maintain equality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

The example explored is the equation: `2x + 3 = 5x - 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This type of equation features variables on both sides, which can initially appear daunting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. While visualizing the equation can aid understanding, the core method involves applying algebraic steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## Step-by-Step Algebraic Solution

The goal is to gather all terms containing `x` on one side of the equation and constant terms on the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### 1. Consolidate Variable Terms
To start [[solving_linear_equations | solving]], subtract `2x` from both sides of the equation to move all `x` terms to the right side, resulting in a positive number of `x`'s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>:

`2x + 3 = 5x - 2`
`- 2x` (from both sides) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>

The left side simplifies to `3` (since `2x - 2x` cancels out) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
The right side simplifies to `3x - 2` (since `5x - 2x = 3x`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

This yields the simplified equation:
`3 = 3x - 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>

### 2. Consolidate Constant Terms
Next, eliminate the constant term from the side with the `x` variable. To remove the `-2` from the right side, add `2` to both sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>:

`3 = 3x - 2`
`+ 2` (to both sides) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>

The left side simplifies to `5` (since `3 + 2 = 5`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
The right side simplifies to `3x` (since `-2 + 2` cancels out) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

This results in:
`5 = 3x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>

### 3. Isolate the Variable
The final step in [[solving_equations_with_variables_on_both_sides | solving equations with variables on both sides]] is to isolate `x` by performing the inverse operation of its coefficient. Since `x` is being multiplied by `3`, [[dividing_to_solve_equations | divide both sides]] of the equation by `3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>:

`5 = 3x`
`/ 3` (on both sides) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>

The left side becomes `5/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
The right side becomes `x` (since the `3`s cancel out) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

So, the solution is:
`5/3 = x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>

It is perfectly acceptable to have the variable on the right side of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. This is equivalent to `x = 5/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

### Mixed Number Conversion
The fractional answer `5/3` can also be expressed as a mixed number. `3` goes into `5` one time with a remainder of `2`, making it `1 2/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
Therefore, `x = 1 2/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

> [!tip] Verification
> To confirm the solution, [[using_substitution_to_verify_algebraic_solutions | substitute the calculated value of x]] back into the original equation (`2x + 3 = 5x - 2`) and ensure both sides are equal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. This step is crucial for confidence in your answer.

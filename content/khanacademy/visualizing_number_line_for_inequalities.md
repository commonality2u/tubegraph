Visualizing a number line is a crucial step in understanding and [[Solving absolute value inequalities | solving absolute value inequalities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This approach emphasizes the meaning of absolute value as the distance from zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, making the solutions intuitive rather than relying on memorized rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## Absolute Value as Distance from Zero

The absolute value of a number represents its distance from zero on the number line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. For example, the absolute value of `x` (`|x|`) asks how far away `x` is from zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Solving Absolute Value Inequalities Using a Number Line

### Case 1: Absolute Value Less Than a Number (e.g., `|x| < 12`)

To solve an inequality like `|x| < 12`, we are looking for all values of `x` that are less than 12 units away from zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

1.  **Visualize on a number line:** Mark 0, positive 12, and negative 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
2.  **Identify the region:** Any number between -12 and 12 will have an absolute value less than 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. For example, `|-6| = 6`, which is less than 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
3.  **Express the solution:** This means `x` must be greater than -12 AND less than 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
    *   As a [[Interval notation and set notation in inequalities | compound inequality]]: `-12 < x < 12` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
    *   In [[Interval notation and set notation in inequalities | interval notation]]: `(-12, 12)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

This concept extends to more complex expressions inside the absolute value, such as `|5x + 3| < 7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. The quantity `(5x + 3)` must be less than 7 units away from zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. This translates to the compound inequality `-7 < 5x + 3 < 7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

### Case 2: Absolute Value Greater Than or Equal to a Number (e.g., `|7x| >= 21`)

To solve `|7x| >= 21`, we are looking for all values of `x` where the expression `7x` is 21 units or more away from zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

1.  **Visualize on a number line:** Mark 0, positive 21, and negative 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
2.  **Identify the regions:**
    *   Numbers greater than or equal to 21 (e.g., 21, 30, etc.) have an absolute value greater than or equal to 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
    *   Numbers less than or equal to -21 (e.g., -21, -30, etc.) also have an absolute value greater than or equal to 21 (e.g., `|-30| = 30`, which is greater than 21) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
3.  **Express the solution:** This leads to a [[Compound inequalities with absolute values | compound inequality]] with "OR": `7x <= -21` OR `7x >= 21` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
4.  **Solve each part:**
    *   `7x <= -21` simplifies to `x <= -3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
    *   `7x >= 21` simplifies to `x >= 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
5.  **Graph the solution set:** On a number line, this would show two separate rays: one starting at 3 and going right, and another starting at -3 and going left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

This logic applies to more complex examples like `|2x/7 + 9| > 5/7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. The expression `(2x/7 + 9)` must be more than 5/7 units away from zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. This means `2x/7 + 9 > 5/7` OR `2x/7 + 9 < -5/7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. Solving these yields `x > -29` OR `x < -34` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

By consistently visualizing the distance from zero on a number line, absolute value inequalities become more understandable and intuitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

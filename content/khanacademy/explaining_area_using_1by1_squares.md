[[basics_of_perimeter_and_area|Area]] is a measurement of how much space a two-dimensional figure occupies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. One intuitive way to understand [[basics_of_perimeter_and_area|area]] is by considering how many "1-by-1 squares" can fit within a given shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. A "1-by-1 square" is simply a square where each side measures one unit in length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

## Area of a Rectangle

To find the [[understanding_and_calculating_area_of_rectangles|area of a rectangle]] using 1-by-1 squares, you determine how many of these unit squares can be arranged to cover the rectangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

Consider a [[calculating_the_perimeter_of_rectangles_and_squares|rectangle]] with sides of length 7 units and 5 units (a "5 by 7 [[calculating_the_perimeter_of_rectangles_and_squares|rectangle]]") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   Along the side that measures 7 units, you can fit 7 individual 1-by-1 squares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
*   Since the other side measures 5 units, you can create 5 such "rows" of 1-by-1 squares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

By arranging 5 rows of 7 squares each, the total number of 1-by-1 squares that can fit within the [[calculating_the_perimeter_of_rectangles_and_squares|rectangle]] is 5 multiplied by 7, which equals 35 squares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. Therefore, the [[understanding_and_calculating_area_of_rectangles|area]] of this [[calculating_the_perimeter_of_rectangles_and_squares|rectangle]] is 35 square units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

This visual method demonstrates the general formula for finding the [[understanding_and_calculating_area_of_rectangles|area of a rectangle]]: multiply one dimension by the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. For instance, a [[calculating_the_perimeter_of_rectangles_and_squares|rectangle]] with dimensions 1/2 by 2 would have an [[understanding_and_calculating_area_of_rectangles|area]] of 1/2 * 2 = 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. This means that two half-units of a 1-by-1 square fit along one dimension, which together form one whole 1-by-1 square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

## Area of a Square

A [[calculating_the_perimeter_of_rectangles_and_squares|square]] is a special type of [[calculating_the_perimeter_of_rectangles_and_squares|rectangle]] where all four sides are equal in length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   To find the [[calculating_area_of_squares|area of a square]], you still multiply its length by its width, but since they are the same, you multiply the side length by itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

For a [[calculating_the_perimeter_of_rectangles_and_squares|square]] with a side length of 2 units, its [[calculating_area_of_squares|area]] is 2 multiplied by 2, which equals 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. This operation is known as [[calculating_area_of_squares|squaring]] a number, and the term itself comes from the process of [[calculating_area_of_squares|finding the area of a square]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. You can easily visualize this by fitting four 1-by-1 squares into a 2-by-2 square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

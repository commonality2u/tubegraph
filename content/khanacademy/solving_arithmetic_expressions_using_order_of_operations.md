[[introduction_to_order_of_operations | Order of operations]] is a fundamental concept in [[understanding_arithmetic_and_expressions | mathematics]] that ensures consistent interpretation of mathematical statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Having a solid understanding of [[introduction_to_order_of_operations | order of operations]] is crucial as it forms the basis for nearly all subsequent mathematical work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Without an [[agreed_upon_order_of_operations | agreed upon order of operations]], a single mathematical statement could be interpreted in multiple ways, leading to different results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This ambiguity is unacceptable in [[importance_of_order_of_operations_in_mathematics | mathematics]] because it can lead to significant errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, for example, a miscalculation in sending a satellite to the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## The Problem of Ambiguity

Consider the mathematical statement: `7 + 3 * 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

Without an [[agreed_upon_order_of_operations | agreed upon order of operations]], two common interpretations arise:

*   **Interpretation 1: Left to Right**
    *   Perform addition first: `7 + 3 = 10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
    *   Then perform multiplication: `10 * 5 = 50` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
    *   Result: `50` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

*   **Interpretation 2: Multiplication Before Addition**
    *   Perform multiplication first: `3 * 5 = 15` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
    *   Then perform addition: `7 + 15 = 22` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
    *   Result: `22` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

These two interpretations yield different answers (50 versus 22) for the same statement, highlighting the necessity of an [[agreed_upon_order_of_operations | agreed upon order of operations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## The [[agreed_upon_order_of_operations | Agreed Upon Order of Operations]]

The universally accepted [[agreed_upon_order_of_operations | order of operations]] dictates the sequence in which operations should be performed to ensure a single, correct interpretation for any mathematical statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. This order is as follows:

1.  **Parentheses (or other grouping symbols)**: Operations inside parentheses are always performed first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
2.  **Exponents**: Operations involving exponents are performed next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. (Note: For this video, exponents are not covered in examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>).
3.  **Multiplication and Division**: These operations are performed next, from left to right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. They have the same level of priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
4.  **Addition and Subtraction**: These operations are performed last, from left to right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. They also have the same level of priority.

This sequence guarantees that for a given statement, everyone will arrive at the same answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

## Applying Order of Operations: Examples

### Simple Example: `7 + 3 * 5`

Using the [[agreed_upon_order_of_operations | agreed upon order of operations]]:

1.  **Parentheses**: None in this expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
2.  **Exponents**: None in this expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
3.  **Multiplication and Division**: Perform the multiplication `3 * 5` first, as it takes priority over addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
    *   `3 * 5 = 15` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
    *   The expression becomes `7 + 15`.
4.  **Addition and Subtraction**: Perform the addition `7 + 15`.
    *   `7 + 15 = 22` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

Therefore, the correct interpretation of `7 + 3 * 5` is `22` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

### Complex Example: `(7 + 3) * 4 / 2 - 5 * 6`

To [[simplifying_expressions | simplify this expression]], follow the [[agreed_upon_order_of_operations | order of operations]]:

1.  **Parentheses**: Perform operations inside the parentheses first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
    *   `(7 + 3) = 10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
    *   The expression becomes `10 * 4 / 2 - 5 * 6`.
2.  **Exponents**: None <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
3.  **Multiplication and Division**: Perform these from left to right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
    *   First, `10 * 4 = 40` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
    *   The expression is now `40 / 2 - 5 * 6`.
    *   Next, `40 / 2 = 20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
    *   The expression is now `20 - 5 * 6`.
    *   Even though multiplication and division have the same priority, `5 * 6` can be performed simultaneously because it's separated by a subtraction sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
    *   `5 * 6 = 30` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
    *   The expression is now `20 - 30`.
4.  **Addition and Subtraction**: Perform these from left to right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
    *   `20 - 30 = -10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

The correct result for `(7 + 3) * 4 / 2 - 5 * 6` is `-10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

### Important Considerations for Same-Level Operations

When multiple operations exist at the same level of priority (e.g., all multiplication and division, or all addition and subtraction), they should be performed from left to right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

For example:
*   `1 + 2 - 3 + 4 - 1`
    *   `1 + 2 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>
    *   `3 - 3 = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>
    *   `0 + 4 = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>
    *   `4 - 1 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>

*   `4 * 2 / 3 * 2`
    *   `4 * 2 = 8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>
    *   `8 / 3 = 8/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>
    *   `8/3 * 2 = 16/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>

### When Order Doesn't Strictly Matter

The only time the specific order of operations becomes flexible is when an expression consists **only** of addition or **only** of multiplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

*   For `1 + 5 + 7 + 3 + 2`, the order of adding numbers does not affect the final sum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   Similarly, for `1 * 5 * 7 * 3 * 2`, the order of multiplying numbers does not affect the final product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

However, if any division or subtraction is present, it's best to stick to the left-to-right rule for same-level operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

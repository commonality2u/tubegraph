Basic addition is a fundamental mathematical concept that can be understood and mastered through visual aids and practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## [[Addition with real life examples | Real-Life Examples for Addition]]

One way to understand [[addition_with_real_life_examples | addition]] is by using tangible objects. For instance:
*   If you have 1 avocado and are given another avocado, you will have 2 avocados in total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. So, 1 + 1 = 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   If you start with 3 avocados and receive 4 more, you will have a total of 7 avocados <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Therefore, 3 + 4 = 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> Avocados are described as a very delicious and the fattiest of all fruits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## [[Number line for addition | Using a Number Line for Addition]]

The [[number_line_for_addition | number line]] is another effective visual tool for understanding [[addition_with_real_life_examples | addition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

To use a number line for [[number_line_for_addition | addition]]:
1.  **Start at the first number** of the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
2.  **Move to the right** (or "go up") on the number line by the amount of the second number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
3.  The number you land on is the sum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

### Examples with a Number Line:

*   **3 + 4 = ?**
    *   Start at 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
    *   Move 4 steps to the right: 1 (to 4), 2 (to 5), 3 (to 6), 4 (to 7) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
    *   The answer is 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

*   **8 + 1 = ?**
    *   Start at 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
    *   Move 1 step to the right: 1 (to 9) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
    *   The answer is 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. (Adding 1 always results in the next sequential number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.)

*   **5 + 6 = ?**
    *   Start at 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
    *   Move 6 steps to the right: 1 (to 6), 2 (to 7), 3 (to 8), 4 (to 9), 5 (to 10), 6 (to 11) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
    *   The answer is 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

*   **8 + 7 = ?**
    *   Start at 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
    *   Move 7 steps to the right: 1 (to 9), 2 (to 10), 3 (to 11), 4 (to 12), 5 (to 13), 6 (to 14), 7 (to 15) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
    *   The answer is 15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

## [[Commutative property of addition | Commutative Property of Addition]]

The order of numbers in [[addition_with_real_life_examples | addition]] does not change the sum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. This is known as the [[commutative_property_of_addition | commutative property of addition]].

For example, 5 + 6 yields the same result as 6 + 5:
*   As seen previously, 5 + 6 = 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   If you start at 6 on the number line and move 5 steps to the right, you also land on 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

This makes sense with [[addition_with_real_life_examples | real-life examples]]: if you have 5 avocados and are given 6, you have 11. If you have 6 avocados and are given 5, you still have 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

## Practice and Memorization

While [[addition_with_real_life_examples | addition]] problems may seem challenging at first, consistent practice using visuals like drawing circles or number lines will help in memorizing sums over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. With enough practice, these problems can be solved in a fraction of a second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

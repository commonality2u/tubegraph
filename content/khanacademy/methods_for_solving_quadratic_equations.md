[[solving_quadratic_equations | Solving quadratic equations]] involves finding the values of the variable that satisfy the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A common form of a [[quadratic_equation | quadratic equation]] is `ax² + bx + c = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. While [[solving_linear_equations | traditional algebraic means]] might be tempting, the most effective method, especially when the equation is explicitly set to zero, is often [[factoring_quadratic_equations | factoring]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Factoring Quadratic Equations

[[factoring_quadratic_equations | Factoring quadratic equations]] involves rewriting the quadratic expression as a product of two binomials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Once factored, the [[solving_quadratic_equations | solutions]] can be found using the zero-product property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### Zero-Product Property

The zero-product property states that if the product of two numbers (or expressions) `A` and `B` is equal to zero, then at least one of them must be zero (either `A = 0` or `B = 0`, or both) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. This property is crucial when [[factoring_quadratic_equations | factoring quadratic equations]] that are set to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

### Factoring by Grouping

One standard method for [[factoring_quadratic_equations | factoring quadratic equations]] is [[factoring_quadratic_equations | factoring by grouping]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This method is generally applicable, even when the leading coefficient (the 'a' in `ax² + bx + c`) is not 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

The steps for [[factoring_quadratic_equations | factoring by grouping]] are:
1.  **Identify coefficients**: For a quadratic equation in the form `s² + bs + c = 0` (e.g., `s² - 2s - 35 = 0`), identify the coefficient of the middle term (b) and the constant term (c) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. In the example, b = -2 and c = -35.
2.  **Find two numbers**: Find two numbers (let's call them 'a' and 'b' for this step, distinct from the quadratic formula coefficients) such that their sum equals the middle coefficient (b) and their product equals the constant term (c) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
    *   `a + b = -2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>
    *   `a * b = -35` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>
    *   Since the product is negative, one number must be positive and the other negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. For the example, the numbers are 5 and -7, as 5 + (-7) = -2 and 5 * (-7) = -35 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
3.  **Split the middle term**: Rewrite the middle term (`bs`) using the two numbers found. For `s² - 2s - 35 = 0`, `-2s` is split into `+5s - 7s` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. The equation becomes `s² + 5s - 7s - 35 = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
4.  **Group and factor**: Group the first two terms and the last two terms, then factor out the greatest common factor from each group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
    *   `s² + 5s` can be factored as `s(s + 5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
    *   `-7s - 35` can be factored as `-7(s + 5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
    *   The equation becomes `s(s + 5) - 7(s + 5) = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
5.  **Factor out common binomial**: Notice that `(s + 5)` is a common factor in both terms. Factor it out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
    *   The factored form is `(s + 5)(s - 7) = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
6.  **Apply zero-product property**: Set each factor equal to zero and [[solving_linear_equations | solve for s]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
    *   `s + 5 = 0` → `s = -5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>
    *   `s - 7 = 0` → `s = 7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>
    The [[solving_quadratic_equations | solutions]] are `s = -5` and `s = 7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

### Shortcut for Factoring when Leading Coefficient is 1

When the leading coefficient of a [[quadratic_equation | quadratic equation]] is 1 (e.g., `x² + bx + c`), a shortcut exists for [[factoring_quadratic_equations | factoring]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. If you can find two numbers 'a' and 'b' such that their sum is `b` and their product is `c`, then the quadratic can be directly factored into `(x + a)(x + b)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

For example, with `s² - 2s - 35 = 0`, the numbers are 5 and -7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   5 + (-7) = -2
*   5 * (-7) = -35
Therefore, the equation can be directly factored as `(s + 5)(s - 7) = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
This directly leads to the [[solving_quadratic_equations | solutions]] `s = -5` and `s = 7` by applying the zero-product property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

[[continuous_random_variables | Continuous random variables]] are one of two varieties of [[random_variables | random variables]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

### Definition
[[continuous_random_variables | Continuous random variables]] are defined as [[random_variables | random variables]] that can take on any value within a given range or interval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This range can even be infinite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

### Key Characteristics
Unlike [[discrete_random_variables | discrete random variables]], the values a [[continuous_random_variables | continuous random variable]] can take on cannot be counted or listed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. If you attempt to list values, you will always find an infinite number of values in between any two listed points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

### Examples
Several scenarios illustrate the nature of [[continuous_random_variables | continuous random variables]]:

*   **Mass of a Random Animal**
    If a [[random_variables | random variable]] *Y* represents the exact mass of a random animal selected at the New Orleans zoo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, it is a [[continuous_random_variables | continuous random variable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. The exact mass can take on an infinite set of values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. For example, an animal's mass might be 123.75921 kilograms, and even that might not be its precise mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Such values are not discrete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. It can be any value within an interval, such as between 0 and 5,000 kilograms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

*   **Exact Winning Time in a Race**
    If a [[random_variables | random variable]] *X* represents the exact winning time for the men's 100-meter dash at the 2016 Olympics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>, it is a [[continuous_random_variables | continuous random variable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. Even though race times are often rounded to hundredths of a second for display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>, the actual exact time can be any value within an interval (e.g., between 5 and 12 seconds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. For instance, the exact time could be 9.571 or 9.572359 seconds, demonstrating that it can take on any value in an interval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.
    *   *Note:* If the winning time is defined as being rounded to the nearest hundredth, it then becomes a [[discrete_random_variables | discrete random variable]] because the possible values become countable and listable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

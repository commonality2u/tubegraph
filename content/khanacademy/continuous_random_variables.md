[[random_variables | Random variables]] are categorized into two main types: [[discrete_random_variables | discrete]] and [[continuous_random_variables | continuous random variables]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Definition
A [[continuous_random_variables | continuous random variable]] is one that can take on any value within a given range or interval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This range can even be infinite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Unlike [[discrete_random_variables | discrete random variables]] which take distinct, separate, and countable values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, [[continuous_random_variables | continuous random variables]] cannot be listed or counted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Even within a finite interval, a [[continuous_random_variables | continuous random variable]] can assume an infinite number of values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

Trying to list all possible values for a [[continuous_random_variables | continuous random variable]] is impossible because between any two values, there is an infinite number of other possible values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

## Examples

### Exact Mass of an Animal
Let Y be the exact mass of a random animal selected at the New Orleans zoo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. The exact mass of an object can take on any value within a range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. For instance, an animal's mass might be 123.75921 kilograms, and even that might not be the exact value, as it could be even more precise (e.g., 9.571, 9.572359) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. This variable does not take on [[discrete_random_variables | discrete]] values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Therefore, the exact mass is a [[continuous_random_variables | continuous random variable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

### Exact Winning Time in a Race
Let X be the exact winning time for the men's 100-meter dash at the 2016 Olympics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. While race times are often rounded to the nearest hundredth for display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>, the actual, precise time could be any value within an interval (e.g., between 5 and 12 seconds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. For example, a time might appear as 9.57 seconds, but the exact time could be 9.571 or 9.572359 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. Because the exact time can take on any value in an interval, it is a [[continuous_random_variables | continuous random variable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

However, if the variable were defined as the winning time rounded to the nearest hundredth, it would become a [[discrete_random_variables | discrete random variable]], as the possible values (e.g., 9.56, 9.57, 9.58) could then be listed and counted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

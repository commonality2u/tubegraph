Visualizing mathematical concepts, particularly on a [[concept_of_number_line_in_mathematics | number line]], can clarify potentially confusing topics like inequalities involving absolute values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Instead of memorizing rules, understanding the visual representation helps internalize the meaning of these expressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## Absolute Value as Distance from Zero

The fundamental meaning of absolute value is how far a number is from zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This concept is best understood using a [[concept_of_number_line_in_mathematics | number line]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### Visualizing "Less Than" Inequalities

Consider the inequality `|x| < 12` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This means finding all values of `x` that are less than 12 units away from 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

On a [[concept_of_number_line_in_mathematics | number line]] with 0 at the center:
*   Numbers less than 12 units from 0 would span from -12 to +12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   Any number between -12 and +12 (exclusive) will have an absolute value less than 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   For example, the absolute value of -6 is 6, which is less than 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. The absolute value of -11 is 11, which is also less than 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   The solution set for `|x| < 12` is `x > -12` AND `x < 12` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. In interval notation, this is `(-12, 12)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

Generally, for `|f(x)| < a`, the expression `f(x)` must be less than `a` away from 0. This translates to `f(x) < a` and `f(x) > -a` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

### Visualizing "Greater Than" Inequalities

Consider the inequality `|7x| ≥ 21` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This means whatever is inside the absolute value, `7x`, must be 21 or more units away from 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

On a [[concept_of_number_line_in_mathematics | number line]] with 0, positive 21, and negative 21 marked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>:
*   Numbers greater than or equal to 21 units away from 0 are those that are `≥ 21` or `≤ -21` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   For example, if `7x` is -30, its absolute value is 30, which is greater than 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   Thus, the condition `|7x| ≥ 21` leads to two separate inequalities:
    1.  `7x ≤ -21` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a> (for values to the left of -21)
    2.  `7x ≥ 21` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a> (for values to the right of 21)
*   Solving these gives the solution set for `x`: `x ≤ -3` OR `x ≥ 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This is then visualized on a [[concept_of_number_line_in_mathematics | number line]] with solid circles at -3 and 3, with shading extending outwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

Generally, for `|f(x)| > a`, the expression `f(x)` must be further than `a` away from 0. This translates to `f(x) > a` OR `f(x) < -a` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

## Applying Visualization to Complex Inequalities

The same visualization principles apply even when the expression inside the absolute value is more complex.

### Example: `|5x + 3| < 7`

1.  **Interpret the absolute value**: The expression `5x + 3` must be less than 7 units away from 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
2.  **Visualize on a [[concept_of_number_line_in_mathematics | number line]]**: This means `5x + 3` must be between -7 and 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
3.  **Formulate compound inequality**: `-7 < 5x + 3 < 7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
4.  **Solve**:
    *   Subtract 3 from all parts: `-10 < 5x < 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
    *   Divide by 5: `-2 < x < 4/5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
5.  **Visualize the solution set**: `x` is greater than -2 and less than 4/5, represented as an open interval `(-2, 4/5)` on a [[concept_of_number_line_in_mathematics | number line]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

### Example: `|2x/7 + 9| > 5/7`

1.  **Interpret the absolute value**: The expression `2x/7 + 9` must be more than 5/7 units away from 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
2.  **Formulate separate inequalities**:
    *   `2x/7 + 9 > 5/7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>
    *   `2x/7 + 9 < -5/7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>
3.  **Solve each inequality**:
    *   Multiply by 7 to clear denominators: `2x + 63 > 5` OR `2x + 63 < -5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
    *   Subtract 63: `2x > -58` OR `2x < -68` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
    *   Divide by 2: `x > -29` OR `x < -34` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.
4.  **Visualize the solution set**: `x` is either less than -34 or greater than -29 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>, represented as two separate open rays extending from -34 and -29 on a [[concept_of_number_line_in_mathematics | number line]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.

By consistently using the [[concept_of_number_line_in_mathematics | number line]] to interpret the meaning of absolute value as distance, these inequalities become intuitive rather than requiring memorized rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

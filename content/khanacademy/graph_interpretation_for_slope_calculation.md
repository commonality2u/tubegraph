[[Understanding slope of a straight line | Slope]] describes how steep a line is on a graph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. For a straight line, the [[slope_of_a_line_in_algebra | slope]] is always constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Formula for Slope

The [[finding the slope of a line | slope]] is defined as the change in 'y' divided by the change in 'x' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This can be written using the capital delta (Δ) symbol, which means "change in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>:

$$
\text{Slope} = \frac{\text{Change in y}}{\text{Change in x}} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}
$$

## Calculating Slope from a Graph

To calculate the [[determining_slope | slope]] from a graph, follow these steps:

1.  **Select Two Points**: Choose any two points on the line that are easy to read, ideally with integer coordinates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
2.  **Determine Change in X (Δx)**: Calculate the horizontal distance between the two chosen points. This is found by subtracting the x-coordinates or by counting units on the x-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
3.  **Determine Change in Y (Δy)**: Calculate the vertical distance between the two chosen points. This is found by subtracting the y-coordinates or by counting units on the y-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
4.  **Calculate the Slope**: Divide the change in y by the change in x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

The value of the [[understanding_slope_as_rate_of_change | slope]] will be consistent regardless of which two points are chosen on the line, as long as the changes in x and y are measured consistently (e.g., if you move left for Δx, it's negative; if you move down for Δy, it's negative) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. This is the essence of [[finding the slope of a line using two points | finding the slope of a line using two points]].

### Example Calculation

Consider a line where we pick two points:

*   **Point 1:** (x = -3, y = -3)
*   **Point 2:** (x = 0, y = -1)

1.  **Change in X (Δx)**: From -3 to 0, Δx is 3 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
2.  **Change in Y (Δy)**: From -3 to -1, Δy is 2 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
3.  **Slope**:
    $$
    \text{Slope} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{2}{3}
    $$
    <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>

Alternatively, using two different points:

*   **Point 3:** (x = 3, y = 1)
*   **Point 4:** (x = -3, y = -3)

1.  **Change in Y (Δy)**: From 1 to -3, Δy is -4 units (going down) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
2.  **Change in X (Δx)**: From 3 to -3, Δx is -6 units (going left) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
3.  **Slope**:
    $$
    \text{Slope} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{-4}{-6} = \frac{2}{3}
    $$
    <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>

Both sets of points yield the same [[understanding_slope_of_a_straight_line | slope]] of 2/3, demonstrating consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

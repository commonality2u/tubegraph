The quadratic formula is considered one of the top five most useful formulas in mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. While generally not a fan of memorization, it is recommended to memorize this formula with the caveat of also understanding its proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Purpose of the Quadratic Formula

The primary purpose of the [[quadratic_formula | quadratic formula]] is to [[solving_quadratic_equations | solve for the roots, or zeroes, of quadratic equations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## General Form of a Quadratic Equation

A general [[quadratic_equations | quadratic equation]] is expressed in the form `ax² + bx + c = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   `a` is the coefficient on the `x²` (second-degree) term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   `b` is the coefficient on the `x` term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   `c` is the constant term (or coefficient on the `x` to the zero term) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## The Formula Itself

For a general [[quadratic_equations | quadratic equation]] `ax² + bx + c = 0`, the [[quadratic_formula | quadratic formula]] states that the solutions for `x` are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>:

> $$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>

Although it may appear complex, with practice, it becomes a more manageable formula to remember <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

### Derivation

The [[quadratic_formula | quadratic formula]] is derived by [[using_completing_the_square_to_derive_the_quadratic_formula | completing the square]] on the general [[quadratic_equations | quadratic equation]] `ax² + bx + c = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Applications and Examples

The [[quadratic_formula | quadratic formula]] is particularly useful for problems that are difficult to [[factoring_quadratic_equations | factor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

### Example 1: Factorable Equation Verification

Consider the equation: `x² + 4x - 21 = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
Here, `a = 1`, `b = 4`, and `c = -21` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

Plugging these values into the formula:
`x = (-4 ± √(4² - 4 × 1 × -21)) / (2 × 1)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>
`x = (-4 ± √(16 + 84)) / 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>
`x = (-4 ± √100) / 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>
`x = (-4 ± 10) / 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>
`x = -2 ± 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>

This yields two solutions:
*   `x = -2 + 5 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>
*   `x = -2 - 5 = -7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>

These results match those obtained by [[factoring_quadratic_equations | factoring]] the equation `(x + 7)(x - 3) = 0`, which also gives `x = -7` or `x = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

### Example 2: No Real Solutions

Consider the equation: `3x² + 6x = -10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
First, rewrite it in standard form: `3x² + 6x + 10 = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
Here, `a = 3`, `b = 6`, and `c = 10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

Plugging these values into the formula:
`x = (-6 ± √(6² - 4 × 3 × 10)) / (2 × 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>
`x = (-6 ± √(36 - 120)) / 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>
`x = (-6 ± √-84) / 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>

Since the term under the square root (`b² - 4ac`), known as the discriminant, is negative, this equation has no real solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. This is because it involves taking the square root of a negative number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Graphing the function `y = 3x² + 6x + 10` reveals that its [[vertex_of_a_quadratic_function | vertex]] is above the x-axis, and it opens upwards, meaning it never intersects the x-axis and thus never equals zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. Solutions involving the square root of a negative number require the concept of imaginary numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

### Example 3: Difficult-to-Factor Equation (Irrational Solutions)

Consider the equation: `-3x² + 12x + 1 = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.
Here, `a = -3`, `b = 12`, and `c = 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

Plugging these values into the formula:
`x = (-12 ± √(12² - 4 × -3 × 1)) / (2 × -3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>
`x = (-12 ± √(144 + 12)) / -6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>
`x = (-12 ± √156) / -6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>

Simplify the radical `√156`:
`√156 = √(4 × 39) = 2√39` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>

Substitute back into the equation:
`x = (-12 ± 2√39) / -6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>

Divide both terms in the numerator by the denominator:
`x = (-12 / -6) ± (2√39 / -6)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>
`x = 2 ± (-√39 / 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>

The `±` accounts for the negative sign in the denominator:
`x = 2 ± √39 / 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>

The solutions are:
*   `x = 2 + √39 / 3`
*   `x = 2 - √39 / 3`

Graphing `y = -3x² + 12x + 1` shows that it is an upward-opening parabola (due to the negative `a` value) that intersects the x-axis at two points, confirming the existence of two real solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

[[definitions_of_work_and_energy | Work]] and energy are fundamental concepts in physics, though they may initially seem [[definitions_of_work_and_energy | circularly defined]] when expressed purely in words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. However, understanding their mathematical [[equations_for_work_and_kinetic_energy | formulations]] provides a more intuitive grasp of their meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## [[definitions_of_work_and_energy | Defining Work]]

In physics, [[definitions_of_work_and_energy | work]] is defined as energy transferred by a force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This definition helps describe the action of applying a force to an object over a distance, resulting in a change in its energy state.

## [[definitions_of_work_and_energy | Defining Energy]]

[[definitions_of_work_and_energy | Energy]] is conceptualized as the ability to do [[definitions_of_work_and_energy | work]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. This means that if an object or system possesses energy, it has the potential to exert a force and cause displacement.

While these verbal [[definitions_of_work_and_energy | definitions]] for [[definitions_of_work_and_energy | work]] and [[definitions_of_work_and_energy | energy]] appear to reference each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, their relationship becomes clearer through [[equations_for_work_and_kinetic_energy | quantitative analysis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## [[equations_for_work_and_kinetic_energy | Work in Mechanics]]

In mechanics, the [[equations_for_work_and_kinetic_energy | definition of work]] is expressed as:

$$
\text{Work} = \text{Force} \times \text{Distance} \tag{00:01:55}
$$

For example, if a force of 10 Newtons is applied to move an object 7 meters, the work done is:

$$
\text{Work} = 10 \text{ N} \times 7 \text{ m} = 70 \text{ Newton meters} \tag{00:02:42}
$$

The unit for [[definitions_of_work_and_energy | work]] (and [[definitions_of_work_and_energy | energy]]) is the Joule (J), where one Newton meter is equivalent to one Joule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## [[kinetic_energy_formula | Kinetic Energy]]

[[kinetic_energy_formula | Kinetic energy]] is a specific form of [[definitions_of_work_and_energy | energy]] that an object possesses due to its motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. It can also be understood as the [[definitions_of_work_and_energy | work]] required to accelerate an object from rest to its current velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

### Derivation of the [[kinetic_energy_formula | Kinetic Energy Formula]]

Consider a block of mass ($m$) starting at rest ($v_i = 0$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>, on which a force ($F$) is applied over a distance ($d$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. The [[definitions_of_work_and_energy | work]] done on the block is $W = F \times d$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

From kinematics, the final velocity ($v_f$) of an accelerating object is given by:

$$
v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2ad \tag{00:05:27}
$$

Since the block starts at rest ($v_i = 0$), the equation simplifies to:

$$
v_f^2 = 2ad \tag{00:05:44}
$$

According to Newton's second law, force ($F$) equals mass ($m$) times acceleration ($a$), so $a = F/m$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Substituting this into the equation for $v_f^2$:

$$
v_f^2 = 2 \left( \frac{F}{m} \right) d \tag{00:06:12}
$$

Rearranging the terms, we get:

$$
m v_f^2 = 2 F d \tag{00:07:51}
$$

Since [[definitions_of_work_and_energy | work]] ($W$) is defined as $F \times d$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>, we can substitute $W$ into the equation:

$$
m v^2 = 2W \tag{00:07:51}
$$

(Note: $v_f$ is simplified to $v$ as it's the final velocity after work is done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>).

Finally, solving for [[definitions_of_work_and_energy | work]] or the [[kinetic_energy_formula | energy]] transferred:

$$
W = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 \tag{00:08:03}
$$

This derived [[equations_for_work_and_kinetic_energy | formula]] is the [[kinetic_energy_formula | definition of kinetic energy]] ($KE$):

$$
KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 \tag{00:08:53}
$$

The unit for [[kinetic_energy_formula | kinetic energy]] is also Joules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. This [[kinetic_energy_formula | formula]] allows us to calculate how much [[definitions_of_work_and_energy | work]] was done to bring an object to a certain velocity, or how much [[definitions_of_work_and_energy | energy]] it possesses due to its motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

In subsequent discussions, other forms of [[definitions_of_work_and_energy | energy]] will be explored, leading to the fundamental principle of the [[definitions_of_work_and_energy | conservation of energy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

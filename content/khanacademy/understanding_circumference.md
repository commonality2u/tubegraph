A [[properties_of_a_circle | circle]] is considered the most fundamental shape in the universe, appearing in natural phenomena like planetary orbits, and in manufactured objects like wheels, even down to a molecular level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Understanding its [[properties_of_a_circle | properties]] is therefore worthwhile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Defining a Circle
A circle is defined as all points that are equidistant from a central point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Every point along the edge of a circle is the same distance from its center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### The Radius
The "equal distance" from the center to any point on the edge of the circle is called the [[definition_and_importance_of_radius | radius]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. The [[definition_and_importance_of_radius | radius]] remains constant for a given circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### The Diameter
The [[definition_and_importance_of_diameter | diameter]] is the distance across the widest point of the circle, passing through the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. The [[definition_and_importance_of_diameter | diameter]] is essentially two [[definition_and_importance_of_radius | radii]] joined together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

The relationship between the [[definition_and_importance_of_diameter | diameter]] (`D`) and the [[definition_and_importance_of_radius | radius]] (`r`) is:
*   `D = 2r` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>

## What is Circumference?
The circumference of a circle is the distance around the circle, as if measuring it with a tape measure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. This is analogous to the [[basics_of_perimeter | perimeter]] of a polygon.

## The Ratio of Circumference to Diameter: Pi (π)
Ancient mathematicians observed that the ratio of a circle's circumference to its [[definition_and_importance_of_diameter | diameter]] was constant for any circle, regardless of its size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Initially, with less precise measurements, this ratio appeared to be roughly 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. As measurements improved, the ratio was found to be closer to 3.1, then 3.14, and so on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. This unique and non-repeating number was given the name "Pi" (π) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

Pi (π) is approximately 3.14159... and is considered one of the most fascinating numbers in the universe due to its fundamental presence in mathematics beyond just circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

The ratio can be expressed as:
*   `Circumference / Diameter = π` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>

## Formulas for Circumference
From the definition of Pi, we can derive formulas to calculate circumference:
1.  **Circumference using Diameter**:
    *   `Circumference = π * Diameter` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>
2.  **Circumference using Radius**: Since `Diameter = 2 * Radius`:
    *   `Circumference = π * (2 * Radius)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>
    *   `Circumference = 2πr` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>

## Examples

### Example 1: Calculating Circumference from Radius
If a circle has a [[definition_and_importance_of_radius | radius]] of 3 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>:
*   Circumference = `2πr` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>
*   Circumference = `2 * π * 3 meters` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>
*   Circumference = `6π meters` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>

The [[definition_and_importance_of_diameter | diameter]] in this case would be `2 * 3 meters = 6 meters` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

### Example 2: Calculating Diameter and Radius from Circumference
If a circle has a circumference of 10 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>:
*   To find the [[definition_and_importance_of_diameter | diameter]]:
    *   `π * Diameter = Circumference` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>
    *   `π * Diameter = 10 meters` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>
    *   `Diameter = 10 / π meters` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>
*   To find the [[definition_and_importance_of_radius | radius]]:
    *   `Radius = 1/2 * Diameter` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>
    *   `Radius = 1/2 * (10 / π meters)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>
    *   `Radius = 5 / π meters` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>

> [!NOTE] Pi is a Number
> It's important to remember that pi (π) is simply a number (approximately 3.14159...) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. Often, calculations involving pi are left in terms of "π" for simplicity and precision, rather than using its decimal approximation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

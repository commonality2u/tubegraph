In [[introduction_to_probability | probability]], understanding the concepts of a "trial" and an "event" is fundamental to [[understanding_probability_concepts | understanding probability concepts]] and [[calculating_probability | calculating probability]]. Probability itself is a method of [[quantifying_outcomes_for_probability | measuring the likelihood]] of something occurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Trial
A **trial** refers to the specific action or process being performed which results in an outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. For instance, in the example of marbles, picking a marble out of a bag is considered a trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

In a trial, there are a number of [[sample_space_and_possible_outcomes | possible outcomes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The collection of all these [[sample_space_and_possible_outcomes | possible outcomes]] is known as the [[sample_space and possible outcomes | sample space]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### Example: Marble Bag Trial
Consider a bag containing:
*   3 yellow marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>
*   2 red marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>
*   2 green marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>
*   1 blue marble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>

When a marble is picked from this bag, the act of "picking a marble" is the trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
The total number of [[sample_space_and_possible_outcomes | possible outcomes]] (the size of the [[sample_space_and_possible_outcomes | sample space]]) is the sum of all marbles: 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Event
An **event** is a specific outcome or a set of outcomes from a trial that meets a particular condition or constraint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. It is the outcome in question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

### Example: Picking a Yellow Marble
Using the marble bag example, if the goal is to find the [[calculating_probability_for_specific_outcomes | probability of pulling a yellow marble]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, then "picking a yellow marble" is the event in question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

To [[calculating_probabilities_for_specific_outcomes | calculate the probability]] of this event, one needs to determine how many of the [[sample_space_and_possible_outcomes | possible outcomes]] satisfy this event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. In this case, there are 3 yellow marbles, meaning there are 3 outcomes that satisfy the event of picking a yellow marble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## Relationship to Probability Calculation
The [[calculating_probability | probability of an event]] is determined by the ratio of the number of outcomes that satisfy the event to the total number of [[sample_space_and_possible_outcomes | possible outcomes]] in the trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>:

$$P(\text{Event}) = \frac{\text{Number of outcomes satisfying the event}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes (size of sample space)}}$$

For the example of picking a yellow marble:
*   Number of outcomes satisfying the event (picking yellow) = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>
*   Total number of [[sample_space_and_possible_outcomes | possible outcomes]] (all marbles) = 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>

Therefore, the probability of picking a yellow marble is 3/8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

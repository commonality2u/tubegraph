The concept of [[understanding_chemical_equations_and_reactions | balancing equations]] is an idea learned in first-year chemistry classes, often presenting a challenge to students despite its straightforward nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This difficulty can be attributed to the "art" involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Defining a Chemical Equation
A chemical equation essentially describes a [[understanding_chemical_equations_and_reactions | chemical reaction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

### Reactants
Reactants are the substances that undergo the [[understanding_chemical_equations_and_reactions | chemical reaction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. They are typically listed on the left side of a chemical equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

### Products
Products are the substances that are formed as a result of the [[understanding_chemical_equations_and_reactions | chemical reaction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. They are typically found on the right side of the chemical equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## The Need for Balancing
Consider an example of a chemical equation involving aluminum and oxygen:
Aluminum (Al) + Oxygen gas (O₂) → Aluminum Oxide (Al₂O₃) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

In this initial representation:
*   **Reactant side**: There is one atom of aluminum and two atoms of oxygen (as an O₂ molecule) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   **Product side**: There are two atoms of aluminum and three atoms of oxygen (as an Al₂O₃ molecule) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

This presents a problem because the number of aluminum atoms differs on both sides (one vs. two) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, and the number of oxygen atoms also differs (two vs. three) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The process of [[balancing_chemical_equations | balancing equations]] aims to resolve this issue by ensuring the same number of atoms for each element on both the reactant and product sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

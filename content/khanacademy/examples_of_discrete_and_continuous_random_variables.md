[[random_variables | Random variables]] are categorized into two main types: [[discrete_vs_continuous_random_variables | discrete random variables]] and [[continuous_random_variables | continuous random variables]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Understanding the [[distinction_between_discrete_and_continuous_random_variables | distinction between discrete and continuous random variables]] is crucial for their application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## [[discrete_random_variables | Discrete Random Variables]]

[[discrete_random_variables | Discrete random variables]] are those that can take on distinct or separate values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This means their possible values can be counted, even if the count is infinite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. You can literally list the values they could take on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### Examples of [[discrete_random_variables | Discrete Random Variables]]

*   **Coin Flip Outcome**: A random variable, `X`, defined as 1 if a fair coin is heads and 0 if it's tails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. This is a [[discrete_random_variables | discrete random variable]] because it can only take on two distinct values: 0 or 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   **Year of Birth**: A random variable, `Y`, representing the year a random student in a class was born <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. This is [[discrete_random_variables | discrete]] because years like 1992, 1985, or 2001 are specific, countable values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. It cannot be any value between, for example, 2000 and 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Number of Ants Born**: A random variable, `Z`, defined as the number of ants born tomorrow in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. This is a [[discrete_random_variables | discrete random variable]] because the number of ants can be counted (e.g., 1, 2, 3, or even 5 quadrillion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
*   **Rounded Winning Time**: The winning time for the men's 100-meter dash at the 2016 Olympics, *rounded to the nearest hundredth* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Even though time itself is continuous, rounding it to specific increments (e.g., 9.56, 9.57, 9.58 seconds) makes the possible outcomes countable and thus [[discrete_random_variables | discrete]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

## [[continuous_random_variables | Continuous Random Variables]]

[[continuous_random_variables | Continuous random variables]] are those that can take on any value within a given range or interval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, which can even be infinite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. For these variables, it's impossible to count or list all possible values, as there are infinitely many between any two points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

### Examples of [[continuous_random_variables | Continuous Random Variables]]

*   **Mass of an Animal**: A random variable, `Y`, representing the exact mass of a random animal selected at the New Orleans zoo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This is a [[continuous_random_variables | continuous random variable]] because the exact mass can be any value within a range (e.g., between 0 and 5,000 kilograms), and can be measured with increasing precision (e.g., 123.75921 kilograms) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. There are an infinite number of possible values it could take on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Exact Winning Time**: The *exact* winning time for the men's 100-meter dash at the 2016 Olympics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This is a [[continuous_random_variables | continuous random variable]] because the precise time, unlike a rounded time, can be any value within an interval (e.g., between 5 and 12 seconds), to an infinite degree of precision (e.g., 9.571 or 9.572359 seconds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

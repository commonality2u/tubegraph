When performing operations like [[multiplying_fractions | multiplying fractions]], it is often necessary to find common factors to [[simplifying_fractions | simplify the result]] or make calculations easier.

## Multiplying Fractions

The process for [[multiplying_fractions | multiplying fractions]] is straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>:
*   The numerator of the product is the product of the individual numerators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   The denominator of the product is the product of the individual denominators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

For example, to multiply 5/6 by 2/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>:
*   Multiply the numerators: 5 * 2 = 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>
*   Multiply the denominators: 6 * 3 = 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>
*   The product is 10/18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Simplifying the Product

After multiplying, the resulting fraction can often be [[simplifying_fractions | simplified]] by finding common factors in the numerator and denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. To express the fraction in its [[simplifying_fractions | lowest terms]], divide both numbers by their greatest common factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

For the example 10/18:
*   Both 10 and 18 are divisible by 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   Divide 10 by 2 to get 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   Divide 18 by 2 to get 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   The simplified answer is 5/9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Canceling Common Factors Before Multiplication

An alternative method for [[simplifying_fractions | simplifying fractions]] when [[multiplying_fractions | multiplying]] is to [[canceling_common_factors_in_expressions | cancel out common factors]] *before* performing the multiplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This can make the numbers smaller and easier to work with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

Using the same example, 5/6 times 2/3:
1.  Identify common factors between any numerator and any denominator. In this case, the numerator 2 (from 2/3) and the denominator 6 (from 5/6) share a common factor of 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
2.  Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their common factor:
    *   Divide 2 by 2, which becomes 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
    *   Divide 6 by 2, which becomes 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
3.  The expression effectively becomes 5/3 times 1/3.
4.  Now, multiply the modified fractions:
    *   5 * 1 = 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>
    *   3 * 3 = 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>
5.  The result is 5/9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, which is the same as simplifying after multiplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

Both methods yield the same correct answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. [[canceling_common_factors_in_expressions | Canceling common factors]] beforehand can sometimes make the numbers more manageable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

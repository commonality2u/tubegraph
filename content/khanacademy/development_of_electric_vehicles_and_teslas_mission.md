## Introduction to Tesla

Elon Musk's company, Tesla, aims to accelerate the advent of [[sustainable_energy_and_future_technology_predictions | sustainable transport]] [00:30:41]. While he believes it would happen out of necessity regardless, Tesla's role is to act as a catalyst [00:31:09] to speed up the normal market forces that would lead to electric vehicles [00:31:14].

## Early Vision and Background

Elon Musk's interest in electric cars predates Tesla's founding. During his college years, he identified the internet, [[sustainable_energy_and_future_technology_predictions | sustainable energy]], and [[exploration_of_space_and_mars_colonization | space exploration]] as the areas that would most profoundly affect the future of humanity [00:44:00]. Initially, he thought electric cars held the best promise [00:06:47].

His academic pursuits at Stanford in applied physics and material science were focused on [[energy_concepts | energy storage]] solutions for electric cars, specifically advanced capacitors [00:06:52] that could exceed the energy density of batteries [00:06:58]. These capacitors, if developed, would offer high power density and quasi-infinite cycle and calendar life, making them ideal for mobile applications [00:07:14]. He even worked at Pinnacle Research, a Silicon Valley company specializing in advanced electrolytic capacitors that achieved the energy density of a lead-acid battery [00:07:57]. However, the use of rare materials like ruthenium made them unsustainable for mass production [00:08:16].

## [[challenges_in_automotive_manufacturing | Challenges in Automotive Manufacturing]]

Manufacturing cars involves thousands of unique components, and the absence of even one can halt production [00:00:23]. Musk recounts a specific incident where a $3 USB cable was missing, stopping the entire production line at the Tesla factory in Fremont [00:00:34]. This cable, being part of the wiring harness, prevented the installation of the car's interior [00:00:45]. To resolve the issue, Tesla had to send people across the Bay Area to buy USB cables from retail stores [00:01:29].

The deeper issue stemmed from the supply chain:
*   **Slow Shipping and Customs Issues** The initial supplier in China grouped Tesla's parts with other companies' goods, sending them via a slow boat that got stuck in LA customs due to paperwork problems with the other items [00:02:07].
*   **Credit Limit Problems** A subsequent air freight order from the supplier's US subsidiary to China exceeded Tesla's credit limit, preventing the shipment [00:03:02].

Such seemingly farcical issues are not unusual in automotive manufacturing, as there are always numerous things going wrong at any given point [00:01:12].

## Tesla's Impact and Market Position

Tesla's objective is to make electric vehicles prevalent by continuously making more cars and driving down their price point until the industry is "very firmly electric" [00:33:05]. Tesla also supplies powertrains to other car companies, including Toyota and Mercedes, to further accelerate their production of electric vehicles [00:31:35].

The company has seen significant success, leading its segment with Model S sales, outperforming traditional luxury cars like the Mercedes S-class and BMW 7 Series [00:31:55]. At the time of this discussion, Tesla was selling around 5,000 cars a quarter, totaling about 12,000 [00:32:17].

## Future Outlook for Electric Vehicles

Musk predicts that it will take approximately 13 to 14 years for half of all new cars made to be electric [00:33:54]. He notes that the pace of technology improvement in electric [[energy_concepts | energy storage]] is progressing faster than many anticipate [00:34:51]. The adoption of new technology typically follows an S-curve, meaning initial predictions are often underestimated, while mid-point predictions can be overestimated due to late adopters [00:34:23].

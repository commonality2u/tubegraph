[[introduction_to_area | Area]] is a measure of how much space a two-dimensional figure takes up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>. One way to conceptualize area is by determining how many 1-by-1 squares can fit within a given figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>.

A square is a special type of [[calculating_area_of_rectangles | rectangle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>. It has four sides and four right angles, with all sides being equal in length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>. For a square or rectangle, only two dimensions need to be specified because the other two will be the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. For example, a "1-by-1 square" indicates that all its sides are of length 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.

## Formula for the Area of a Square

To calculate the area of a square, you multiply the length of one side by itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>. This is because a square is a special case of a rectangle where the length and width are the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>.

If `s` represents the length of a side of the square, the area (A) can be found using the formula:
`A = s * s` or `A = sÂ²`

>[!INFO] Origin of the Term "Squaring"
The mathematical operation of "squaring" a number (multiplying it by itself) derives its name from the process of finding the area of a square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>.

## Example

Consider a square XYZS where one side, XS, is equal to 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>. Since it's a square, all sides are equal, meaning the other side (e.g., the width) is also 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>.

To find the area of square XYZS:
1.  Multiply the length of one side by itself: 2 * 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>.
2.  The area is 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>.

This means you can fit four 1-by-1 squares onto this 2-by-2 square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>.

Area measures the amount of two-dimensional space a figure occupies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. For any shape, the area can be conceptualized as the number of [[explaining_area_using_1by1_squares | 1-by-1 squares]] that can fit within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

## What is a Square?

A [[recognizing_perfect_squares | square]] is a special type of [[understanding_and_calculating_area_of_rectangles | rectangle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. It has four sides and four right angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. The key characteristic of a [[recognizing_perfect_squares | square]] is that all of its sides are equal in length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

## Formula for Area of a Square

Since a [[recognizing_perfect_squares | square]] is a special [[understanding_and_calculating_area_of_rectangles | rectangle]] where length and width are the same, its area is calculated by multiplying its side length by itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

If 's' represents the length of one side of a [[recognizing_perfect_squares | square]], the area (A) can be found using the formula:
`A = s * s` or `A = s²`

This is where the term "[[square_roots_and_perfect_squares | squaring]] something" comes from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

## Example Calculation

Consider a [[recognizing_perfect_squares | square]] named XYZS, where one side length (XS) is 2 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
To find the area of [[recognizing_perfect_squares | square]] XYZS:
1.  Identify the side length: `s = 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
2.  Multiply the side length by itself: `2 * 2 = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
3.  Alternatively, [[square_roots_and_perfect_squares | square]] the side length: `2² = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

The area of the 2-by-2 [[recognizing_perfect_squares | square]] is 4 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. This means 4 [[explaining_area_using_1by1_squares | 1-by-1 squares]] can fit within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> The notation for the area of a figure often involves placing the figure's name in brackets, e.g., Area[XYZS] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

## Overview of the Nonspecific Immune System
The [[innate_immune_system | nonspecific]], or [[innate_immune_system | innate immune system]], is the body's initial defense mechanism against pathogens and harmful substances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. It operates without needing to recognize specific types of viruses, proteins, or bacteria, instead identifying general "shady" characteristics and acting to eliminate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This system exists across many species and types of organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

The [[innate_immune_system | nonspecific immune system]] is broadly divided into two lines of defense:
*   **First Line Barriers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>
*   **Second Line of Defense** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>

## First Line Barriers
The first line of defense consists of natural barriers designed to prevent harmful entities from entering the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. These barriers include:
*   **Skin** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>
*   **Stomach acid** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>
*   **Acidity of oils on the skin's surface** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>

These are fundamental protective measures that act as physical or chemical deterrents, preventing invaders from getting inside the body in the first place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Second Line of Defense (Nonspecific)
Once pathogens manage to bypass the first line barriers and enter the body, the second line of defense, also still nonspecific, takes over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This includes responses such as:
*   [[inflammatory_response_overview | Inflammatory response]]: A process that helps direct immune cells and substances to the site of action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   [[phagocytes_and_their_role_in_immunity | Phagocytes]]: Cells that engulf and destroy invaders, regardless of their specific type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. [[phagocytes_and_their_role_in_immunity | Phagocytes]] like dendritic cells, macrophages, and neutrophils are types of white blood cells (leukocytes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. They identify general signs of foreignness, such as double-stranded DNA, which is characteristic of viruses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

Donations play a crucial role in [[Khan Academy and online education | Khan Academy's]] ability to expand its reach, improve its educational offerings, and pursue its long-term aspirations of providing free, world-class education to anyone, anywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Recent Support from the Musk Foundation
In a testament to the organization's impact, [[Elon Musk donation to Khan Academy | Elon Musk]] and the Musk Foundation recently provided a generous $5 million donation to [[Khan Academy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This significant contribution is intended to accelerate various aspects of Khan Academy's mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

### Accelerating Content and Software Development
The donation will allow [[Khan Academy]] to:
*   Accelerate the development of content across all subjects, from K-12 through early college stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   Specifically boost its science content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   Expand its early learning initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   Make its software and practice exercises more engaging for millions of students and teachers worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Current Global Reach and Impact
[[Khan Academy]] has already established a substantial global presence:
*   It boasts 120 million registered users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   Between 20 and 30 million students actively use the platform every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   Users engage in approximately 200 million hours of learning annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

Efficacy studies demonstrate that [[Khan Academy]] effectively moves the dial in classrooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Its social return on investment ratio is estimated to be between 400 to 500 to 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, significantly higher than the philanthropic sector's good return ratio of 5 to 1 or 10 to 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Long-Term Aspirations and Ongoing Need
Despite significant progress and large donations, [[Khan Academy]] continues to operate at a deficit for 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, emphasizing the ongoing need for financial support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

[[Khan Academys educational goals and aspirations | Khan Academy's aspirations]] are immense:
*   To serve billions of people worldwide who need a way to tap into their potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   To build a multi-generational institution that helps future generations, including "future [[Elon Musk]]s of the world," realize their potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

Sal Khan notes that the world collectively spends five trillion dollars annually on education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. In contrast, [[Khan Academy's]] budget is one one-hundred-thousandth of that, comparable to a large high school, yet it aims to serve the entire globe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. This highlights the disproportionate impact a relatively small budget can have when leveraged effectively.

The organization believes that educating the planet, and potentially other planets in the future, is a mission that cannot be shied away from, akin to solving climate change or colonizing other planets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Every donation, regardless of size, contributes to accelerating learning across many dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

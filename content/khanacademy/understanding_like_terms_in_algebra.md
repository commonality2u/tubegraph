In algebra, the ability to [[understanding_algebraic_expressions | simplify expressions]] often involves identifying and combining "like terms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. This process builds upon concepts familiar from arithmetic, specifically the [[the_abstraction_and_generalization_in_algebra | distributive property]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## What are Like Terms?

Like terms are terms that have the same variable raised to the same power. For instance, `21y` and `-8y` are considered like terms because they both involve the variable `y` raised to the first power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Constants (numbers without any variables) are also like terms with each other.

Terms that involve different variables or the same variable raised to different powers are not like terms. For example, `21y` cannot be directly combined with `-35` or `-20` because they are "adding different things" or "subtracting different things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Combining Like Terms

The process of [[combining_like_terms_in_algebraic_equations | combining like terms]] involves adding or subtracting their coefficients while keeping the variable part the same.

### Example 1: Basic Simplification

To [[understanding_algebraic_expressions | simplify the expression]] `2(3x + 5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>:
1.  **Understand the expression:** `2(3x + 5)` literally means two groups of `(3x + 5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This can be written as `(3x + 5) + (3x + 5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
2.  **Apply the Distributive Property:** This is equivalent to `2(3x) + 2(5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
    *   `2 * 3x` equals `6x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
    *   `2 * 5` equals `10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
3.  **Result:** The expression [[understanding_algebraic_expressions | simplifies to]] `6x + 10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. In this case, `6x` and `10` are not like terms, so they cannot be combined further.

### Example 2: More Involved Simplification

Consider the expression `7(3y - 5) - 2(10 + 4y)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

1.  **Distribute the `7` on the left side:**
    *   `7 * 3y` gives `21y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
    *   `7 * -5` gives `-35` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
    *   So, `7(3y - 5)` becomes `21y - 35` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

2.  **Distribute the `-2` on the right side:**
    *   Think of it as distributing `-2` rather than `2` and then subtracting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
    *   `-2 * 10` gives `-20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
    *   `-2 * 4y` gives `-8y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
    *   So, `-2(10 + 4y)` becomes `-20 - 8y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

3.  **Combine the simplified parts:** The expression is now `21y - 35 - 20 - 8y`.

4.  **Identify and combine like terms:**
    *   **Terms with `y`:** `21y` and `-8y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
        *   `21y - 8y = 13y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
    *   **Constant terms:** `-35` and `-20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
        *   `-35 - 20 = -55` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

5.  **Final Simplified Expression:** Combining these results, the entire expression [[understanding_algebraic_expressions | simplifies]] to `13y - 55` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. This final expression cannot be simplified further as `13y` and `-55` are not like terms.

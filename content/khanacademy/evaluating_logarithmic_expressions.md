Evaluating a logarithmic expression fundamentally involves determining what power a base number must be raised to in order to yield another specified number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This process is essentially the inverse of calculating [[relationship_between_exponents and logarithms | exponents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Basic Concept

Consider the exponential expression 2 to the fourth power, which means 2 multiplied by itself four times (2 * 2 * 2 * 2), resulting in 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

If we pose the question, "what power (let's call it 'x') must 2 be raised to in order to get 16?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, we find that 'x' must be 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This is the core idea behind [[introduction_to_logarithms | logarithms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### Logarithm Notation

The way to express this question using [[logarithm_properties_and_notation | logarithm notation]] is:
`log base 2 of 16 = x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>

This logarithmic statement is completely equivalent to the exponential statement:
`2^x = 16` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>

Both forms ask: "What power do I need to raise 2 to, to get 16?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a> The answer remains 'x' = 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## [[examples_of_calculating_logarithms | Examples of Calculating Logarithms]]

To evaluate a logarithmic expression, you are essentially determining the exponent.

### Example 1: `log base 3 of 81`

To evaluate `log base 3 of 81` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>:
1.  Ask: "What power do we have to raise 3 to, to get to 81?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>
2.  You can set this equal to 'x' and rewrite it as an exponential equation: `3^x = 81` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
3.  Experiment with powers of 3:
    *   3 to the first power = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>
    *   3 to the second power = 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>
    *   3 to the third power = 27 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>
    *   3 to the fourth power = 81 (27 * 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>
4.  Therefore, `x = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
    *   `log base 3 of 81 = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>

### Example 2: `log base 6 of 216`

To evaluate `log base 6 of 216` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>:
1.  Ask: "What power do we have to raise 6 to, to get 216?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>
2.  Experiment with powers of 6:
    *   6 to the first power = 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>
    *   6 to the second power = 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>
    *   6 to the third power = 216 (36 * 6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>
3.  So, `log base 6 of 216 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

### Example 3: `log base 2 of 64`

To evaluate `log base 2 of 64` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>:
1.  Ask: "What exponent do I have to raise the base 2 to, to get to 64?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>
2.  Count powers of 2:
    *   2^1 = 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>
    *   2^2 = 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>
    *   2^3 = 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>
    *   2^4 = 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>
    *   2^5 = 32 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>
    *   2^6 = 64 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>
3.  Thus, `log base 2 of 64 = 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

## Special Case: Logarithm of 1

### Example: `log base 100 of 1`

To evaluate `log base 100 of 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>:
1.  Ask: "What power do I have to raise 100 to, to get to 1?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>
2.  If you set this to 'x', the equation is `100^x = 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.
3.  Any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 is equal to 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
4.  Therefore, `x = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
    *   `log base 100 of 1 = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>

This demonstrates a general [[logarithm_properties_and_notation | logarithm property]]: log base anything (that is not 0) of 1 will always be equal to 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

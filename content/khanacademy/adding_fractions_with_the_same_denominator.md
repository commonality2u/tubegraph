When adding fractions that share the same [[denominator_and_numerator_in_fractions | denominator]], the process is relatively straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This method applies when the "total number of pieces" (represented by the denominator) is consistent across the fractions you are combining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## The Basic Rule

To add fractions with the same denominator:
1.  Ensure that both fractions have identical denominators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
2.  The denominator of the sum will remain the same as the original denominators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
3.  Add the [[denominator_and_numerator_in_fractions | numerators]] (the top numbers) together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Examples

### Example 1: 1/4 + 1/4

Consider adding 1/4 + 1/4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
Imagine a pie divided into four pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   If you eat one piece (1/4 of the pie) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   And then eat another piece (another 1/4 of the pie) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   You have eaten a total of 2 out of the 4 pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, or 2/4 of the pie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

Mathematically, you add the numerators (1 + 1 = 2) and keep the denominator the same (4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
Therefore, 1/4 + 1/4 = 2/4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

This result, 2/4, can be [[simplifying_fractions | simplified]] to 1/2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Eating 2 out of 4 pieces is indeed the same as eating half of the pie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

### Example 2: 2/5 + 1/5

To calculate 2/5 + 1/5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>:
*   The denominators are the same (5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   Keep the denominator as 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   Add the numerators: 2 + 1 = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   So, 2/5 + 1/5 = 3/5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

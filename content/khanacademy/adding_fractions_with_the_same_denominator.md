This article explains how to add fractions when they share the same denominator. This concept also applies to [[Subtracting fractions with the same denominator | subtracting fractions with the same denominator]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>

## The Basic Principle

When adding fractions with the same denominator, you simply add the numerators (the top numbers) and keep the denominator (the bottom number) the same. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>

### Example: 1/4 + 1/4

Consider the sum of 1/4 plus 1/4. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>

Imagine a pie divided into four pieces. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a> If you eat one piece (1/4 of the pie) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a> and then eat another piece (another 1/4 of the pie), <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a> you will have eaten a total of 2 out of the 4 pieces. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>

Mathematically:
> 1/4 + 1/4 = 2/4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>

The denominators (4) stayed the same because that represents the total number of pieces in the pie. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a> The numerators (1 and 1) were added to reflect the total number of pieces eaten. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>

The fraction 2/4 can be simplified to 1/2, as explained in the [[Simplifying fractions | equivalent fractions]] module. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>

### Example: 2/5 + 1/5

To add 2/5 plus 1/5: <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>
1.  Check that the denominators are the same (they are, both are 5). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>
2.  The denominator of the answer will also be 5. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>
3.  Add the numerators (2 + 1). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>

> 2/5 + 1/5 = (2 + 1)/5 = 3/5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>

## Subtraction with the Same Denominator

The same principle applies to subtraction. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>

### Example: 3/7 - 2/7

To subtract 3/7 minus 2/7: <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>
1.  Keep the denominator the same (7). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>
2.  Subtract the numerators (3 - 2). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>

> 3/7 - 2/7 = (3 - 2)/7 = 1/7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>

This makes sense because if you have 3 out of 7 pieces of a pie and give away 2 out of 7 pieces, you are left with 1 of the 7 pieces. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>

## Dealing with Whole Numbers

A whole number can always be written as a fraction. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a> For instance, 1 can be written as 1/1, 2/2, 3/3, or 10/10. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>

### Example: 1/10 - 1

To solve 1/10 minus 1: <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>
1.  Rewrite 1 as a fraction with a denominator of 10, which is 10/10. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>
2.  Now you have 1/10 - 10/10. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>
3.  Subtract the numerators (1 - 10) and keep the denominator (10). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>

> 1/10 - 1 = 1/10 - 10/10 = (1 - 10)/10 = -9/10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>

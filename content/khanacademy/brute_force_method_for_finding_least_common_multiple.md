The "brute force method" for finding the [[least common multiple | least common multiple]] (LCM) involves listing out the multiples of each number until a common one is found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. This method is also referred to as "just looking at the multiples of these numbers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

## How it Works

To use this method, you enumerate the multiples of each given number in increasing order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. The first (smallest) multiple that appears in both lists is the [[least common multiple | least common multiple]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

### Example: Finding the LCM of 18 and 12

To find the [[least common multiple | least common multiple]] of 18 and 12 using the brute force method:

1.  **List multiples of 18**:
    *   18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>
    *   36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>
    *   54 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>
    *   (and so on) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>
2.  **List multiples of 12**:
    *   12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>
    *   24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>
    *   36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>

Upon reaching 36 in the list of multiples for 12, it's observed that 36 is already present in the list for 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Since it's the first common multiple found, the [[least common multiple | least common multiple]] of 18 and 12 is 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

## Considerations

While straightforward, this method can become inefficient when dealing with very large numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. For "really, really, really large and hairy numbers," one might have to list many multiples before finding the [[least common multiple | least common multiple]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. In such cases, the [[prime_factorization_method_for_finding_least_common_multiple | prime factorization approach]] offers a more systematic way to determine the LCM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

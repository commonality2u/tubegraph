The concept of [[identifying_perfect_squares | perfect squares]] is fundamental to solving quadratic equations, particularly through the [[completing_the_square_technique | completing the square technique]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## What is a Perfect Square?

In [[introduction_to_algebra | algebra]], a perfect square in the context of quadratic equations refers to an expression that can be written as the square of a binomial, such as $(x-a)^2$ or $(x+a)^2$. These forms are particularly straightforward to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

### The Structure of a Perfect Square
A quadratic expression in the form $x^2 - 2ax + a^2$ is a perfect square, equivalent to $(x-a)^2$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Similarly, $x^2 + 2ax + a^2$ equals $(x+a)^2$.
For an expression like $x^2 + Bx + C$ to be a perfect square, the constant term $C$ must be the square of half the coefficient of $x$ (i.e., $(B/2)^2$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Role in [[completing_the_square | Completing the Square]]

[[completing_the_square | Completing the square]] is a technique for solving quadratic equations by manipulating the equation to make one side a [[identifying_perfect_squares | perfect square]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This method adds and subtracts terms from both sides of an equation to achieve this form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. It is the basis for the quadratic formula itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

### How to Create a Perfect Square
To turn an expression like $x^2 - 4x$ into a perfect square, you determine the number that, when squared, gives the constant term, and when doubled, gives the coefficient of the $x$ term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
1.  Take the coefficient of the $x$ term (e.g., -4).
2.  Find half of this coefficient (e.g., -4 / 2 = -2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This value represents 'a' in the binomial $(x-a)^2$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
3.  Square this result (e.g., $(-2)^2 = 4$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. This is the number you need to add to complete the square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

### Example: Transforming an Equation
Consider the quadratic equation: $x^2 - 4x = 5$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
To make the left side a perfect square:
1.  Take half of the coefficient of $x$ (which is -4): $-4/2 = -2$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
2.  Square that result: $(-2)^2 = 4$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
3.  Add this number (4) to *both* sides of the equation to maintain equality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>:
    $x^2 - 4x + 4 = 5 + 4$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>
4.  The left side is now a perfect square: $(x-2)^2 = 9$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
5.  Taking the square root of both sides allows for solving the equation:
    $x - 2 = \pm 3$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>
    $x = 2 \pm 3$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>
    This yields two solutions: $x = 5$ or $x = -1$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

### Advantages
While other [[algebraic_methods_in_algebra | algebraic methods]] like factoring might be faster for some problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, [[completing_the_square | completing the square]] is a universally applicable technique that will *always* work for any quadratic equation, regardless of its coefficients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. This is particularly useful for problems that are difficult or impossible to solve by simple factoring, especially those involving fractions or irrational numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

The solutions derived from using this method can be verified by [[checking_solutions_in_algebra | checking solutions]] against the original equation, yielding a result very close to zero due to calculator precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

*   **Accelerate Content Development:** Allow for the faster creation of content across all subjects, from kindergarten through the early stages of college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Ongoing [[financial_challenges_and_needs_of_khan_academy | Financial Needs]]

Despite the substantial donation, Sal Khan emphasized that [[khan_academy_and_its_educational_impact | Khan Academy]] continues to require [[financial_challenges_and_needs_of_khan_academy | financial support]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. The organization operated at a deficit for 2021, and every donation, regardless of size, helps to accelerate learning across various dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

The global annual expenditure on education is $5 trillion, yet [[khan_academy_and_its_educational_impact | Khan Academy's]] budget is only one one-hundred-thousandth of that, comparable to a large high school's budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. However, [[khan_academy_and_its_educational_impact | Khan Academy's]] [[global_reach_and_goals_of_khan_academy | aspirations]] are to serve the entire globe, necessitating broader support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

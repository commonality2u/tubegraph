From: [[khanacademy]] <br/> 

Elon Musk and The Musk Foundation have provided a significant donation of $5 million to [[Khan Academy and online education | Khan Academy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Sal Khan, founder of [[Khan Academy and online education | Khan Academy]], expressed immense gratitude for this generous support, highlighting its anticipated impact on the organization's mission to provide [[global_education_and_accessibility | free, world-class education for anyone, anywhere]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Impact of the Donation

The $5 million contribution is expected to significantly accelerate [[Khan Academys educational goals and aspirations | Khan Academy's content development efforts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Specifically, it will:
*   Advance the goal of offering content for all subjects from kindergarten through the early stages of college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   Speed up the creation of science content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   Enable more resources for early learning initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   Enhance the engagement of its software and practice exercises for millions of students and teachers worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

Khan emphasizes that this investment is foundational for [[Khan Academys educational goals and aspirations | building Khan Academy into a multi-generational institution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, ensuring future generations, including "future Elon Musks," can access and tap into their full potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Khan Academy's Reach and Efficacy

[[Khan Academys global reach and user statistics | Khan Academy]] currently boasts 120 million registered users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, with 20 to 30 million students actively using the platform each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Users accumulate approximately 200 million hours of learning annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

Studies on the platform's efficacy show a significant positive impact in classrooms, with a social return on investment ratio estimated at 400 to 500 to 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This is substantially higher than what is considered a "good return" in the philanthropic sector, typically a 5 to 1 or 10 to 1 ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Continued Funding Needs and Aspirations

Despite the substantial donation from The Musk Foundation, [[Khan Academy and online education | Khan Academy]] continues to operate at a deficit for 2021 and requires ongoing support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Sal Khan highlights that while the world spends five trillion dollars annually on education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, [[Khan Academy and online education | Khan Academy's]] budget is only one hundred thousandth of that, comparable to a large high school's budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Their aspiration, however, is to serve the entire globe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Inspiration from Elon Musk

Sal Khan expressed personal admiration and inspiration drawn from Elon Musk. He recounted interviewing Musk in 2013 at the [[Khan Academy and online education | Khan Academy]] office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Khan noted that most of the "large statements" Musk made back then have either been accomplished or are very close to being realized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

This track record of achieving ambitious goals instills confidence in Khan that the mission to [[global_education_and_accessibility | educate all of humanity]] is not too big <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. He parallels this educational goal to other global challenges like solving climate issues, improving transportation through [[development_of_electric_vehicles_and_teslas_mission | electric vehicles]], and [[exploration_of_space_and_mars_colonization | colonizing other planets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Khan believes humanity should not shy away from the immense task of educating the planet and even other planets in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

[[glycolysis_process_and_its_role_in_breaking_down_glucose | Glycolysis]] is a crucial biochemical pathway found in nearly all known life forms, focused on breaking down glucose [00:00:07]. This [[glycolysis_process_and_its_role_and_its_role_in_breaking_down_glucose | process]] converts a six-carbon glucose molecule into two three-carbon pyruvate molecules [00:00:17]. All [[steps_and_reactions_in_glycolysis | steps and reactions in glycolysis]] are facilitated by enzymes [00:04:14]. Enzymes operate by lowering the activation energy required for a reaction to occur [00:04:31].

## Investment Phase Enzymes

The initial phase of glycolysis, often referred to as the "investment phase," consumes ATP [00:00:40].

*   **Hexokinase**
    *   Facilitates the first step: the phosphorylation of glucose [00:04:10].
    *   A kinase is an enzyme that manages phosphorylation or dephosphorylation [00:04:21].
    *   This enzyme is aided by a magnesium ion as a co-factor, which helps lower the activation energy [00:04:37].
    *   This reaction uses one ATP molecule (minus one ATP) [00:04:48] and strongly favors going from left to right due to coupled reactions [00:04:58]. The reaction replaces a hydrogen on glucose with a phosphate group [00:05:17].

*   **Phosphoglucose Isomerase**
    *   This enzyme facilitates the conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate [00:05:51].
    *   Isomerases are enzymes that help convert one isomer of a molecule into another [00:06:00].
    *   This specific reaction can be in equilibrium, but the continuous consumption of subsequent products drives the reaction forward [00:05:32]. The main change involves a bond shift, forming a five-element ring (fructose) from a six-element ring (glucose) [00:06:07].

*   **Phosphofructokinase**
    *   Facilitates another strong forward reaction by phosphorylating fructose-6-phosphate [00:06:32].
    *   As a kinase, it utilizes another ATP molecule (minus one ATP) [00:06:38], attaching a second phosphate group to the fructose molecule [00:06:42].
    *   This enzyme is also aided by a magnesium co-factor, which helps stabilize the negative charge of the phosphate groups [00:06:59]. This marks the second ATP investment [00:07:08].

*   **Fructose Bisphosphate Aldolase**
    *   This enzyme facilitates the "lysing" or breaking up of the six-carbon fructose-1,6-bisphosphate molecule [00:07:42].
    *   Aldolase enzymes facilitate aldol reactions, which can involve merging or, in this case, breaking molecules [00:07:54].
    *   It breaks the molecule into two three-carbon chains: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and another isomer (dihydroxyacetone phosphate) [00:08:06].

*   **Triose Phosphate Isomerase**
    *   Converts dihydroxyacetone phosphate into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate [00:08:16].
    *   This ensures that both three-carbon chains derived from glucose can proceed through the rest of the glycolytic pathway [00:08:23]. Therefore, the subsequent reactions occur twice for every original glucose molecule [00:08:32].

## Payoff Phase Enzymes

The later phase of glycolysis is where the energy investment is recouped, and a [[net_energy_yield_in_glycolysis | net gain of ATP]] and NADH is achieved [00:09:43].

*   **Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate Dehydrogenase**
    *   A dehydrogenase enzyme that facilitates the reduction of NAD+ to NADH [00:08:46].
    *   This enzyme also adds another phosphate group to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, producing 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate [00:09:11].
    *   The NADH produced can later be used in the electron transport chain to generate more ATP through oxidative phosphorylation [00:02:07]. Since two glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate molecules are processed, two NAD+ molecules are reduced to two NADH [00:11:38].

*   **Phosphoglycerate Kinase**
    *   This kinase removes one of the phosphate groups from 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, attaching it to ADP to produce ATP [00:09:53].
    *   This marks the beginning of the "payoff phase" for [[atp_production_in_glycolysis | ATP production]] [00:09:43].
    *   Since this reaction occurs twice (for each of the two 3-carbon molecules), it produces two ATPs [00:10:03].

*   **Phosphoglycerate Mutase**
    *   A type of isomerase that moves a functional group (in this case, a phosphate group) from one part of a molecule to another [00:10:17].
    *   It moves the phosphate group from the third carbon to the second carbon of 3-phosphoglycerate, converting it to 2-phosphoglycerate [00:10:29].

*   **Enolase**
    *   Converts 2-phosphoglycerate into phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) [00:10:37].

*   **Pyruvate Kinase**
    *   A kinase that dephosphorylates phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) [00:10:44].
    *   It removes the remaining phosphate group from PEP and transfers it to ADP, producing the final product of glycolysis, pyruvate (or pyruvic acid) [00:10:47].
    *   As this step also occurs twice, it yields another two ATP molecules [00:11:11].

In summary, the [[glycolysis_process_and_phases | glycolysis process]] uses two ATPs in the investment phase and produces four ATPs in the payoff phase, resulting in a [[net_energy_yield_in_glycolysis | net yield of two ATPs]] and two NADH molecules per glucose molecule [00:00:30]. The NADH can then be utilized in subsequent pathways like the electron transport chain to produce additional ATP [00:02:07].

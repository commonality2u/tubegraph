[[balancing_chemical_equations | Balancing chemical equations]] is a fundamental concept in chemistry, which, while initially confusing, can be mastered with a careful and methodical approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It involves understanding the "art" of chemical equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## What is a Chemical Equation?

A [[introduction_to_chemical_equations | chemical equation]] describes a reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. For example, when an atom of aluminum reacts with a dioxygen molecule (O₂), they form aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) under appropriate conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The aluminum oxide molecule contains two aluminum atoms and three oxygen atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

The initial, unbalanced equation for this reaction looks like this:
Al + O₂ → Al₂O₃

## Why Balance a Chemical Equation?

A chemical equation needs to be balanced because the number of each type of atom must be the same on both sides of the equation (reactants and products) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This adheres to the principle of [[conservation_of_mass_in_chemical_reactions | conservation of mass]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Atoms cannot simply appear or disappear out of thin air during a reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

Consider the example:
*   **Aluminum (Al)**: On the left-hand side, there is one aluminum atom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. On the right-hand side (in Al₂O₃), there are two aluminum atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. These numbers are not balanced.
*   **Oxygen (O)**: On the left-hand side, there are two oxygen atoms (in O₂) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. On the right-hand side (in Al₂O₃), there are three oxygen atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. These numbers are also not balanced.

Therefore, the number of aluminums and oxygens on both sides must be made equal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Steps to Balance the Equation

### 1. Initial Adjustment for an Element

To begin, consider the aluminum atoms. Since there are two on the right (Al₂O₃) and one on the left (Al), you can multiply the aluminum atom on the left by two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>:
2Al + O₂ → Al₂O₃

Now, the aluminum atoms are balanced (two on each side) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. However, the oxygen atoms remain unbalanced (two on the left, three on the right) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

### 2. Addressing Remaining Imbalances (and the Whole Number Convention)

To balance the oxygens, you might consider multiplying the O₂ molecule on the left by 1.5 (1.5 × 2 = 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>:
2Al + 1.5 O₂ → Al₂O₃

While this balances the oxygen atoms (three on each side), the [[whole_number_convention_in_chemical_equations | convention]] in chemistry is that we do not use fractions or decimals for the number of molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. We aim for [[whole_number_convention_in_chemical_equations | whole number molecules]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### 3. Multiplying by a Common Factor to Achieve Whole Numbers

Similar to solving algebraic equations, you can multiply the entire equation by a number that eliminates the fraction or decimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. In this case, multiplying everything by two will turn 1.5 into a whole number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>:

*   Start with the equation that has decimals: 2Al + 1.5 O₂ → 1 Al₂O₃ (note the implicit '1' in front of Al₂O₃) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   Multiply all coefficients by two:
    *   2 × 2 Al = 4 Al <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>
    *   2 × 1.5 O₂ = 3 O₂ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>
    *   2 × 1 Al₂O₃ = 2 Al₂O₃ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>

The resulting balanced chemical equation is:
4Al + 3O₂ → 2Al₂O₃

### 4. Verification

Finally, verify that all atoms are balanced on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>:

*   **Aluminum (Al)**:
    *   Left side: 4 aluminum atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>
    *   Right side: 2 molecules of Al₂O₃ means 2 × 2 = 4 aluminum atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>
    *   **Balanced**

*   **Oxygen (O)**:
    *   Left side: 3 molecules of O₂ means 3 × 2 = 6 oxygen atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>
    *   Right side: 2 molecules of Al₂O₃ means 2 × 3 = 6 oxygen atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>
    *   **Balanced**

The chemical equation is now balanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

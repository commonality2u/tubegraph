[[Introduction to Probability | Probability]] is a concept that quantifies the likelihood of an event occurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. It provides a way to describe the chances of a fundamentally random event, even if the specific outcome is unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Calculating Probability

One common way to [[probability_calculation | calculate probability]], often introduced in textbooks, involves comparing the number of favorable possibilities to the total number of equally likely possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>:

> Number of possibilities that meet conditions / Number of equally likely possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>

Another way to conceptualize [[probability_calculation | probability]] is through [[experimentation_in_probability | experimentation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. If an experiment is run many, many times (e.g., a thousand, a million, or even infinitely), the probability represents the percentage of those trials that would result in the desired outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. The more times the experiment is run, the closer the observed results will trend towards the true probability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

## Fair Coin Example

A "fair coin" is defined as having an equal chance of landing on either side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This means the coin's sides are equal in weight, and it's not more likely to land on one side than the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

When flipping a fair coin, there are two [[outcomes_in_coin_flipping | equally likely possibilities]]: heads or tails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

*   **Probability of getting Heads:**
    *   There is 1 possibility (heads) that meets the condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
    *   There are 2 equally likely possibilities in total (heads or tails) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
    *   Therefore, the probability of getting heads is 1/2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>, which is equivalent to 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

If one were to flip a coin many times (e.g., 100 or 200 times simultaneously by shaking them in a box), the proportion of heads would likely be very close to 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. While there's a small chance of extreme results (like all tails over a million flips), the more flips performed, the closer the outcome will be to 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

## Fair Die Example

Similar to a fair coin, a "fair die" has six equally likely possibilities when rolled: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

*   **[[calculating_probability_with_dice | Probability of rolling a 1]]:**
    *   There is 1 possibility (rolling a 1) that meets the condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.
    *   There are 6 equally likely possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
    *   The probability is 1/6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

*   **[[calculating_probability_with_dice | Probability of rolling a 1 or a 6]]:**
    *   There are 2 possibilities (1 or 6) that meet the conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.
    *   There are 6 equally likely possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
    *   The probability is 2/6, which simplifies to 1/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

*   **[[calculating_probability_with_dice | Probability of rolling a 2 and a 3 (on a single roll)]]:**
    *   This is an example of [[mutually_exclusive_events_in_probability | mutually exclusive events]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. It is impossible to get both a 2 and a 3 on a single roll of a die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
    *   The probability is 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

*   **[[calculating_probability_with_dice | Probability of rolling an even number]]:**
    *   The even numbers on a die are 2, 4, and 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
    *   There are 3 possibilities that meet the condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
    *   There are 6 equally likely possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
    *   The probability is 3/6, which simplifies to 1/2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

Area is a measurement of how much two-dimensional space an object occupies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. One way to conceptualize [[concept_of_area_using_1by1_squares | area]] is by determining how many 1-by-1 squares can fit within a given figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

## Area of Rectangles (General Case)

For a rectangle, the general method to calculate its [[how_to_calculate_the_area_of_rectangles | area]] is to multiply its two dimensions (length and width) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. For example, a rectangle with dimensions 7 by 5 would have an area of 35, as 35 1-by-1 squares can fit within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## Area of Squares

A square is a special type of rectangle where all four sides are equal in length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. Because the length and width are the same for a square, calculating its area is a specific application of the rectangle formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

To find the area of a square, you multiply the length of one side by itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. This operation is also known as "squaring" the number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

### Example

Consider a square named XYZS where one side (XS) is 2 units long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Since it's a square, all sides are 2 units long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

To calculate the area:
*   Area = side × side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>
*   Area = 2 × 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>
*   Area = 2 squared (2²) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>
*   Area = 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>

This means that four 1-by-1 squares can fit perfectly within a 2-by-2 square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. The term "squaring" a number originates from the geometric concept of finding the area of a square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

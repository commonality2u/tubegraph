[[solving_linear_equations | Solving linear equations]] often involves isolating the variable by performing inverse operations. For equations where a variable is multiplied by a coefficient, the inverse operations are division or multiplication by a reciprocal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Understanding the Notation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>

In algebra, when a number (coefficient) is written directly next to a variable (e.g., `5x`), it implies multiplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. So, `5x = 20` is equivalent to "5 times what number equals 20?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The variable `x` takes the place of the unknown value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

### Algebraic Conventions for Multiplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>
Various symbols are used for multiplication in algebra to avoid confusion with the variable 'x':
*   **Writing next to a variable**: As in `5x`, directly implies multiplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   **A dot**: For example, `5 â‹… x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   **Parentheses**: For example, `5(x)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

## Basic Application of Division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>

To [[dividing_to_solve_equations | solve linear equations]] like `5x = 20`, you can systematically divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

### Example: `5x = 20`
1.  **Identify the coefficient**: The coefficient is 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
2.  **Divide both sides**: Divide both sides of the equation by 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
    `5x / 5 = 20 / 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>
3.  **Simplify**: The 5s on the left cancel out, and 20 divided by 5 is 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
    `x = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>

## Using Multiplication by the Reciprocal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>

An equivalent method to [[dividing_to_solve_equations | dividing to solve equations]] is multiplying by the reciprocal of the coefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Multiplying by a reciprocal (e.g., 1/5) is the same as dividing by the number (e.g., 5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This method is especially useful when dealing with fractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

The "coefficient" is the number being multiplied by the variable `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

### Example: `(-3/4)x = 10/13` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>
1.  **Identify the coefficient**: The coefficient is -3/4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
2.  **Find the reciprocal**: The reciprocal of -3/4 is -4/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
3.  **Multiply both sides**: Multiply both sides of the equation by -4/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
    `(-4/3) * (-3/4)x = (10/13) * (-4/3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>
4.  **Simplify**:
    *   On the left, (-4/3) and (-3/4) cancel out to 1, leaving `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
    *   On the right, multiply the numerators and denominators: `10 * -4 = -40` and `13 * 3 = 39` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
    `x = -40/39` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>

### Example: `(-5/6)x = 7/8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>
1.  **Identify the coefficient**: The coefficient is -5/6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
2.  **Find the reciprocal**: The reciprocal of -5/6 is -6/5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
3.  **Multiply both sides**: Multiply both sides by -6/5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
    `(-6/5) * (-5/6)x = (7/8) * (-6/5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>
4.  **Simplify**:
    *   Left side cancels to `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
    *   Right side: You can simplify by dividing 6 and 8 by 2 (6 becomes 3, 8 becomes 4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
        `7 * -3 = -21` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>
        `4 * 5 = 20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>
    `x = -21/20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>

## Checking Your Answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>

A valuable step in [[using_algebraic_steps_to_solve_equations | solving equations]] is to check your answer by substituting the calculated value of `x` back into the original equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

### Example Check for `x = -40/39` in `(-3/4)x = 10/13` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>
1.  **Substitute `x`**: `(-3/4) * (-40/39) = 10/13` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>
2.  **Simplify**:
    *   Cancel out common factors: 4 into -40 becomes -10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
    *   Divide 30 and 39 by 3 to get 10/13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
    *   `(-3) * (-10) = 30` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>
    *   `1 * 39 = 39` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>
    `30/39 = 10/13` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>
    Since `10/13 = 10/13`, the answer is correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

This systematic approach using [[multiplication_and_division_in_equations | multiplication and division in equations]] allows you to [[solving_linear_equations | solve linear equations]] effectively, even with more complex numbers or fractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

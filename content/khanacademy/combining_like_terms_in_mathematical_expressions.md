Simplifying mathematical expressions often involves applying properties like [[simplifying_expressions_using_the_distributive_property | the distributive property]] and then [[combining_like_terms_in_algebraic_equations | combining like terms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This process aims to rewrite an [[understanding_algebraic_expressions | algebraic expression]] in a simpler, [[understanding_equivalent_expressions | equivalent form]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Applying the Distributive Property

The [[simplifying_expressions_using_the_distributive_property | distributive property]] states that multiplying a sum or difference by a number is the same as multiplying each term by the number and then adding or subtracting the products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

### Example 1: Basic Distribution
To simplify an expression like `2(3x + 5)`:
*   This literally means two instances of `(3x + 5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   So, it can be written as `(3x + 5) + (3x + 5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   This is equivalent to having two `(3x)` terms and two `(5)` terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   Therefore, it becomes `2(3x) + 2(5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   Multiplying these, `2(3x)` results in `6x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   And `2(5)` results in `10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   Thus, `2(3x + 5)` simplifies to `6x + 10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### Example 2: Multiple Distributions and Negative Signs
Consider a more complex expression: `7(3y - 5) - 2(10 + 4y)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

1.  **Distribute on the left side**: `7(3y - 5)`
    *   Multiply `7` by `3y`: `7 * 3y = 21y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
    *   Multiply `7` by `-5`: `7 * -5 = -35` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
    *   So, the left side simplifies to `21y - 35` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

2.  **Distribute on the right side with the negative sign**: `-2(10 + 4y)`
    *   It is crucial to treat the `-2` as the number being distributed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
    *   Multiply `-2` by `10`: `-2 * 10 = -20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
    *   Multiply `-2` by `4y`: `-2 * 4y = -8y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
    *   So, the right side simplifies to `-20 - 8y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

3.  **Combine the simplified parts**: The expression now is `21y - 35 - 20 - 8y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Combining Like Terms

After distribution, the next step in [[simplifying_expressions_using_the_distributive_property | simplifying expressions]] is [[combining_like_terms_in_algebraic_equations | combining like terms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. [[understanding_like_terms_in_algebra | Like terms]] are terms that have the same variables raised to the same power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

For `21y - 35 - 20 - 8y`:
*   **Identify like terms with the variable `y`**: `21y` and `-8y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
    *   Combine them: `21y - 8y = 13y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **Identify constant terms**: `-35` and `-20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
    *   Combine them: `-35 - 20 = -55` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

The fully simplified expression is `13y - 55` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

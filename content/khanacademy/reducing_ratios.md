Ratios are mathematical expressions used to [[introduction_to_ratios | compare quantities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. They can be written in various ways, such as using a colon (e.g., 10:5), as a fraction (e.g., 10/5), or with the word "to" (e.g., 10 to 5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The order in which quantities are presented matters; the first quantity mentioned corresponds to the first number in the ratio, and so on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

## Why Reduce Ratios?

While a ratio like 10:5 accurately compares 10 horses to 5 dogs, it can often be [[simplifying_fractions | simplified]] to express the comparison in its most concise form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. A ratio of 10 horses to 5 dogs implies that for every 1 dog, there are 2 horses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. This simplified ratio, 2:1, conveys the same relationship more directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

A ratio tells you the proportional relationship between quantities, not necessarily the exact number of items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. The general convention is to express ratios in their [[simplifying_rational_expressions | simplest form]] or [[fraction_reduction_techniques | reduced form]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

## How to Reduce Ratios

To reduce a ratio, you need to find the largest number that divides evenly into all the numbers in the ratio. This is known as the [[step_by_step_radical_simplification_examples | greatest common divisor]] (GCD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

### Examples of Reducing Ratios

#### Two Quantities
If you have 10 horses and 5 dogs, the ratio of horses to dogs is 10:5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
1.  **Find the GCD**: The biggest number that divides into both 10 and 5 is 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
2.  **Divide by the GCD**: Divide both numbers in the ratio by the GCD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
    *   10 ÷ 5 = 2
    *   5 ÷ 5 = 1
3.  **Reduced Ratio**: The reduced ratio of horses to dogs is 2:1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This can also be written as 2/1 or 2 to 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

Conversely, if the ratio of dogs to horses is requested, you would start with 5:10. Dividing both by 5 gives the reduced ratio of 1:2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

#### Ratios with Multiple Quantities
The same principle applies to [[ratios_with_multiple_quantities | ratios involving more than two quantities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
Suppose you have 20 apples, 40 oranges, and 60 strawberries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. The ratio of apples to oranges to strawberries is 20:40:60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
1.  **Find the GCD**: Identify the largest number that divides into all three quantities (20, 40, and 60) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. In this case, the GCD is 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
2.  **Divide all quantities by the GCD**:
    *   20 ÷ 20 = 1
    *   40 ÷ 20 = 2
    *   60 ÷ 20 = 3
3.  **Reduced Ratio**: The reduced ratio of apples to oranges to strawberries is 1:2:3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. This means for every 1 apple, there are 2 oranges and 3 strawberries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

The order of the quantities in the ratio matters. If the ratio of strawberries to oranges to apples were requested, and the reduced ratio is 3:2:1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

## Using Reduced Ratios to Solve Problems

Reduced ratios are crucial for [[using_ratios_to_solve_problems | solving problems]] involving totals or unknown quantities, as they provide a clear and concise proportional relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. For example, if the ratio of boys to girls in a classroom is 2:3, and there are 40 students total, you can use the reduced ratio to find the number of girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

1.  **Understand the total "parts"**: In a 2:3 ratio of boys to girls, there are 2 + 3 = 5 "parts" for every group of students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This means for every 5 students, there are 2 boys and 3 girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
2.  **Determine the number of "groups"**: Divide the total number of students by the total "parts" in the ratio: 40 students / 5 parts per group = 8 groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.
3.  **Calculate the specific quantity**: Since each group contains 3 girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>, multiply the number of groups by the number of girls per group: 8 groups * 3 girls/group = 24 girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

This method extends to [[understanding_ratios_in_different_scenarios | more complex scenarios]] with multiple quantities, such as the ratio of sheep to chickens to pigs being 2:5:10 with a total of 51 animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. The sum of the ratio parts (2 + 5 + 10 = 17) represents the total "animals per group" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. Dividing the total animals by this sum (51 / 17 = 3 groups) reveals how many such groups exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. From there, you can calculate specific quantities, like the number of chickens: 3 groups * 5 chickens/group = 15 chickens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.

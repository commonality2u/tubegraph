Ratios are expressions that compare quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. They tell you how much of one quantity there is relative to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Expressing and Understanding Ratios

A basic ratio can compare two quantities, like 10 horses to 5 dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This can be expressed in several ways:
*   Using a colon: 10:5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>
*   As a fraction: 10/5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>
*   Using words: "10 to 5" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>

In these expressions, the quantity mentioned first (horses) corresponds to the first number (10), and the quantity mentioned second (dogs) corresponds to the second number (5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

### Order Matters
The order in which quantities are stated is crucial for [[understanding_ratios | understanding ratios]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. For example:
*   The ratio of horses to dogs is 10:5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   The ratio of dogs to horses is 5:10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

### Reducing Ratios to Simplest Form
Just like fractions, ratios can be reduced to their simplest form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. To do this, find the [[factors_that_sum_and_multiply_to_specific_values | greatest common divisor]] (the largest number that divides into both quantities) and divide each part of the ratio by it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

For example, a ratio of 10 horses to 5 dogs (10:5) can be reduced by dividing both numbers by 5, resulting in a ratio of 2:1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. This means for every 2 horses, there is 1 dog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. While 10:5 is not incorrect, the convention is to express ratios in their simplest form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

## Ratios with More Than Two Items

Ratios can also compare three or more quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. For instance, if you have 20 apples, 40 oranges, and 60 strawberries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>:
*   The ratio of apples to oranges to strawberries is 20:40:60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   To simplify this ratio, find the greatest common divisor for all three numbers. In this case, it's 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   Dividing all parts by 20 gives a reduced ratio of 1:2:3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. This means for every 1 apple, there are 2 oranges and 3 strawberries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

Just like with two items, the order matters: the ratio of strawberries to oranges to apples would be 3:2:1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

## Finding Quantities from Given Ratios

Sometimes, you are given a ratio and a total quantity, and you need to find the specific number of each item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

### Example 1: Two Items
If the ratio of boys to girls in a classroom is 2:3, and there are 40 students total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>:
1.  **Find the "group" size**: Add the parts of the ratio together. 2 (boys) + 3 (girls) = 5 students per "group" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
2.  **Determine the number of groups**: Divide the total number of students by the group size. 40 students / 5 students per group = 8 groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
3.  **Calculate individual quantities**: Multiply the number of groups by the respective ratio part.
    *   For girls: 8 groups * 3 girls/group = 24 girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
    *   For boys: 8 groups * 2 boys/group = 16 boys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

### Example 2: Multiple Items
If the ratio of sheep to chickens to pigs on a farm is 2:5:10, and there are 51 animals total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>:
1.  **Find the "group" size**: Add the parts of the ratio. 2 (sheep) + 5 (chickens) + 10 (pigs) = 17 animals per "group" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.
2.  **Determine the number of groups**: Divide the total number of animals by the group size. 51 animals / 17 animals per group = 3 groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.
3.  **Calculate individual quantities**: Multiply the number of groups by the respective ratio part.
    *   For chickens: 3 groups * 5 chickens/group = 15 chickens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

This method allows you to [[finding_quantities_from_given_ratios | find quantities from given ratios]] by thinking in terms of "groups" represented by the sum of the ratio parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

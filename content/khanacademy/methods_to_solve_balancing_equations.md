[[balancing_chemical_equations | Balancing chemical equations]] is a fundamental concept taught in first-year chemistry that often presents a challenge to students, despite being a straightforward idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The difficulty arises from the "art" involved in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## What is a Chemical Equation?
A chemical equation describes a chemical reaction, showing the reactants (the substances that react) and the products (what is formed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. For example, the reaction of aluminum with diatomic oxygen gas yields aluminum oxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

### The Problem of Unbalanced Equations
An unbalanced chemical equation presents a problem because the number of atoms of each element is not equal on both sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This violates the law of conservation of mass. For instance, if you start with one atom of aluminum and two atoms of oxygen, but end up with two atoms of aluminum and three atoms of oxygen in the product, the equation is unbalanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. The goal of [[balancing_chemical_equations | balancing chemical equations]] is to ensure that the number of atoms for each element is the same on both the reactant and product sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## General Approach to Balancing Chemical Equations
A [[systematic_approach_to_solving_equations | systematic approach]] can make the [[steps_to_balance_a_chemical_equation | steps to balance a chemical equation]] smoother:

1.  **Prioritize Complex Molecules:** Begin balancing elements found in the most complex molecules first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
2.  **Save Single-Atom Molecules for Last:** Elements that appear as single atoms or in simple diatomic molecules (like O₂ or H₂) should be balanced last. This is because their coefficients can be adjusted without affecting the balance of other elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
3.  **Adjust Coefficients Only:** When [[balancing_equations_by_performing_operations_on_both_sides | balancing equations by performing operations on both sides]], you can only change the coefficients (the numbers in front of the molecules), not the subscripts within a molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Changing subscripts would alter the chemical identity of the substance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
4.  **Work Atom by Atom:** Systematically go through each element and adjust coefficients to balance its atoms across the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

### Handling Fractions in Balancing
Sometimes, when balancing, you might find it convenient to use a fractional coefficient temporarily, such as 1.5 or 3.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Since you cannot have half an atom or molecule in reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>:
*   **Multiply the Entire Equation:** Once all elements are balanced, multiply every coefficient in the entire equation by the smallest whole number that eliminates all fractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. For example, if you have 1.5, multiply by 2.

### Dealing with Polyatomic Ions
For more complex [[examples_of_balancing_different_types_of_equations | examples of balancing different types of equations]], if a polyatomic group (like sulfate SO₄) remains intact on both sides of the equation, you can treat it as a single "atom" or unit to simplify the balancing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. After balancing the "substituted" group, you can revert to its original chemical formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

### Final Check
After performing all adjustments, verify the balance by counting the number of atoms for each element on both sides of the equation to ensure they are equal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

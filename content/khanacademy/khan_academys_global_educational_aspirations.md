From: [[khanacademy]] <br/> 

[[khan_academy_origins_and_growth | Khan Academy]] extends a heartfelt thank you to [[elon_musks_donation_to_khan_academy | Elon Musk]] and the Musk Foundation for their generous $5 million donation, which is set to significantly accelerate the organization's educational mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Impact of the Donation
The recent [[elon_musks_donation_to_khan_academy | donation from Elon Musk]] is expected to have a profound [[impact_of_the_donation_on_educational_content | impact on educational content]] and software development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Specifically, it will enable Khan Academy to:
*   Accelerate the creation of content across all subjects, from kindergarten through the early stages of college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   Boost science content development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   Expand efforts in early learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   Enhance the engagement of software and practice exercises for millions of students and teachers worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Current Reach and Efficacy
Despite its progress, Khan Academy emphasizes that its mission to provide [[global_access_to_education_and_peer_tutoring | global access to education]] is far from complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Currently, the platform boasts:
*   120 million registered users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   20 to 30 million students actively using the platform each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   Approximately 200 million hours of learning annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

Efficacy studies demonstrate that Khan Academy effectively "moves the dial" in classrooms, showcasing a social [[philanthropic_return_on_investment_in_education | return on investment]] ratio of 400 to 500 to 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This significantly surpasses the typical good return in the philanthropic sector, which is considered to be five to ten to one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Future Aspirations
Khan Academy's vision is to establish a multi-generational institution capable of helping billions of people worldwide tap into their full potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The goal is to uplift humanity as a civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. While the global annual expenditure on education is roughly five trillion dollars, Khan Academy's budget remains a mere one hundred thousandth of that, comparable to a large high school's budget, despite its aspiration to serve the entire globe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Call for Further Support
Despite the substantial [[elon_musks_donation_to_khan_academy | donation from Elon Musk]], Khan Academy continues to operate at a deficit for 2021 and requires ongoing support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Every donation, regardless of size, contributes to accelerating learning across various dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Inspiration from Elon Musk
Sal Khan expresses deep admiration for [[elon_musks_donation_to_khan_academy | Elon Musk]], citing his unwavering commitment to ambitious goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Khan recalls interviewing Musk in 2013, noting that Musk has either achieved or is close to achieving nearly all the bold statements he made then <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. This serves as an inspiration for Khan Academy's mission to educate all of humanity, underscoring that no mission is too big if one does not shy away from the challenge, much like addressing climate change, transportation, or colonizing other planets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. The organization believes it cannot shy away from educating the planet and potentially other planets in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

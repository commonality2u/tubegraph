In physics, the [[concept_of_work_in_physics|concept of work]] differs slightly from its everyday usage, though they are not entirely unrelated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. While in common language work might mean "doing something" or "making a living" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, in physics, work is formally defined as [[relation_between_work_and_energy|energy transferred by a force]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Conversely, energy is defined as the "ability to do work," creating a somewhat circular [[relation_between_work_and_energy|relationship between the two concepts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. To gain a more quantitative [[understanding_mathematical_equations|understanding]], it's helpful to move beyond verbal definitions to [[mathematical_expressions|mathematical equations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## Defining Work Mathematically

In mechanics, the fundamental [[mathematical_expressions|mathematical definition]] of work is:
$$
\text{Work} = \text{Force} \times \text{Distance}
$$
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>

For example, if a force of 10 Newtons is applied to a block, moving it 7 meters, the work done on the block, or the energy transferred to it, would be:
$$
\text{Work} = 10 \text{ Newtons} \times 7 \text{ meters} = 70 \text{ Newton meters}
$$
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>

The unit of work, a Newton meter, is also defined as one **Joule** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The Joule is also the standard unit for energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

## Deriving Kinetic Energy from Work

To further illustrate the [[relation_between_work_and_energy|relationship between work and energy]], consider a block of mass 'm' starting at rest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. If a force 'F' is applied, pushing the block for a distance 'd' across a frictionless surface, the work done is `Work = F × d` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Since force causes acceleration (`F = ma`), the block will gain velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

Using a kinematics equation, the final velocity squared (`v_f^2`) can be expressed as:
$$
v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2ad
$$
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>
Since the block starts at rest, the initial velocity (`v_i`) is 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. So the equation simplifies to:
$$
v_f^2 = 2ad
$$
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>
From Newton's second law, acceleration (`a`) can be expressed as `a = F/m` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Substituting this into the equation:
$$
v_f^2 = 2 \left( \frac{F}{m} \right) d
$$
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>
Rearranging this [[mathematical_expressions|expression]], we notice `F × d`, which is the definition of work:
$$
v_f^2 = \frac{2 (Fd)}{m}
$$
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>
Replacing `Fd` with `Work`:
$$
v_f^2 = \frac{2 \times \text{Work}}{m}
$$
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>
Multiplying both sides by 'm' (and simplifying `v_f` to `v` as it's the final velocity from rest):
$$
mv^2 = 2 \times \text{Work}
$$
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>
Finally, dividing by 2, we get the equation for work, which is also the definition of **kinetic energy**:
$$
\text{Work} = \frac{1}{2} mv^2
$$
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>
This [[calculating_kinetic_energy|kinetic energy]] is the work imputed into an object to get it to a certain velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. It represents the energy an object possesses due to its motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. The unit for kinetic energy is also Joules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

This [[mathematical_expressions|formula]], `KE = 1/2 mv^2`, is a very common and fundamental concept in physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. It represents one form of energy, and its [[understanding_mathematical_equations|understanding]] is crucial for exploring concepts such as other forms of energy and the law of [[relation_between_work_and_energy|conservation of energy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

Long division is a method for dividing large numbers by breaking the problem down into a series of smaller steps. A fundamental prerequisite for tackling division, especially with larger numbers, is a solid understanding of [[importance_of_multiplication_tables_in_division | multiplication tables]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. It's recommended to know them from 1 times 1 up to at least 10 times 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, or even 12 times 12 as some are taught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Division as Reverse Multiplication

For basic division problems, the simplest way to think about them is by relating them back to [[understanding_multiplication_using_examples | multiplication]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

*   **Example 1: 25 divided by 5**
    To solve 25 ÷ 5, consider "5 times what equals 25?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Knowing your 5-multiplication tables, you'd recall that 5 times 5 is 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Therefore, 5 goes into 25 five times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. When writing the answer, be mindful of [[understanding_place_value_in_division | place value]], placing the 5 in the ones place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Example 2: 49 divided by 7**
    Similarly, for 49 ÷ 7, the question is "7 times what equals 49?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. The answer from [[importance_of_multiplication_tables_in_division | multiplication tables]] is 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **Example 3: 54 divided by 9**
    For 54 ÷ 9, you'd ask "9 times what equals 54?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. If you know that 9 times 5 is 45, adding another 9 (9 times 6) gives 54 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. So, 9 goes into 54 six times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## Handling Remainders in Division

Not all division problems result in a whole number. Sometimes there's a remainder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

*   **Example: 23 divided by 3**
    1.  List the multiples of 3: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
    2.  Notice that 23 is not a multiple of 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
    3.  Find the largest multiple of 3 that is less than or equal to 23. This is 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
    4.  Determine how many times 3 goes into 21: 3 times 7 is 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. So, 3 goes into 23 seven times cleanly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
    5.  Calculate the remainder: Subtract the multiple (21) from the dividend (23). 23 - 21 = 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
    6.  The answer is "7 remainder 2" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This means it goes in 7 times, with 2 left over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Remainder
> When a number doesn't divide "cleanly," you find the largest multiple of the divisor that fits into the dividend and then state the difference as the remainder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

## Basic Steps in Long Division for Larger Numbers

Long division extends these concepts to multi-digit numbers. The process involves a series of divide, multiply, subtract, and bring down steps, paying close attention to [[understanding_place_value_in_division | place value]].

### Example 1: 344 divided by 4

1.  **Divide the first digit(s):** Look at how many times 4 goes into the first digit of 344. 4 goes into 3 zero times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. Move to the first two digits: 34 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
    *   How many times does 4 go into 34? Use your 4-multiplication tables. 4 × 8 = 32, and 4 × 9 = 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Since 36 is larger than 34, use 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.
    *   Write 8 in the quotient above the 4 in the tens place of 344 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
2.  **Multiply:** Multiply the quotient digit (8) by the divisor (4): 8 × 4 = 32 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Write 32 below 34 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
3.  **Subtract:** Subtract 32 from 34: 34 - 32 = 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
4.  **Bring Down:** Bring down the next digit (4) from the dividend to form a new number: 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
5.  **Repeat (Divide):** Now, how many times does 4 go into 24? 4 × 6 = 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
    *   Write 6 in the quotient above the 4 in the ones place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
6.  **Repeat (Multiply):** Multiply the new quotient digit (6) by the divisor (4): 6 × 4 = 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Write 24 below the current 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
7.  **Repeat (Subtract):** Subtract 24 from 24: 24 - 24 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
Since there are no more digits to bring down and the remainder is 0, the division is complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
The result is 86 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

### Example 2: 91 divided by 7

1.  **Divide:** 7 goes into 9 one time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. Write 1 above the 9.
2.  **Multiply:** 1 × 7 = 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Write 7 below the 9.
3.  **Subtract:** 9 - 7 = 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
4.  **Bring Down:** Bring down the 1 to make 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
5.  **Repeat (Divide):** 7 goes into 21 three times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. Write 3 above the 1.
6.  **Repeat (Multiply):** 3 × 7 = 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Write 21 below the 21.
7.  **Repeat (Subtract):** 21 - 21 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
The result is 13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

### Example 3: 608 divided by 8

1.  **Divide:** 8 goes into 6 zero times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Consider 60.
    *   How many times does 8 go into 60? 8 × 7 = 56, and 8 × 8 = 64 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. Since 64 is too big, use 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
    *   Write 7 above the 0 in 608 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
2.  **Multiply:** 7 × 8 = 56 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. Write 56 below 60.
3.  **Subtract:** 60 - 56 = 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
4.  **Bring Down:** Bring down the 8 to make 48 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
5.  **Repeat (Divide):** How many times does 8 go into 48? 8 × 6 = 48 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.
    *   Write 6 above the 8 in 608 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.
6.  **Repeat (Multiply):** 6 × 8 = 48 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. Write 48 below the current 48.
7.  **Repeat (Subtract):** 48 - 48 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
The result is 76 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

From: [[khanacademy]] <br/> 

Grammar is inherently context dependent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The type of grammar utilized changes throughout the day based on several factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Factors Influencing Grammar Use
The kind of grammar one uses depends on:
*   **Who** you are talking to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>
*   **What** you are trying to say <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>
*   **How** you are trying to say it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>

Because of these dependencies, people use multiple kinds of grammar throughout their days and lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Focus of Khan Academy Grammar Videos
While there are many "Englishes" that are "great," "wonderful," "vibrant," "important," and "special" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, these specific videos primarily focus on one particular kind of grammar: Standard American English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

It is emphasized that the purpose of these videos is not to teach what is "right" or "wrong" in language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. If someone's English differs from the Standard American English presented, that is perfectly acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The goal is to provide tools to harness English and use it in any desired way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> The speaker acknowledges that individuals already possess a significant amount of [[preexisting_grammar_knowledge | grammar knowledge]] from their everyday lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The videos aim to provide names for this existing knowledge, enhancing one's command over it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

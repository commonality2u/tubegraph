The term "mean," when used without further specification, typically refers to what is commonly known as the [[arithmetic_mean | average]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This specific type of mean is also known as the [[arithmetic_mean | arithmetic mean]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. It is a fundamental method for measuring [[mean_or_central_tendency_in_statistics | central tendency]] within a dataset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## How to Calculate the Mean

To calculate the [[arithmetic_mean | arithmetic mean]], follow these steps:
1.  **Sum all numbers**: Add up every number in the dataset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
2.  **Count the numbers**: Determine how many individual numbers are in the dataset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
3.  **Divide the sum by the count**: The result is the mean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Example Calculation

Let's find the mean for the following set of numbers: 23, 29, 20, 32, 23, 21, 33, 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

1.  **Sum the numbers**:
    23 + 29 + 20 + 32 + 23 + 21 + 33 + 25 = 206 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>
2.  **Count the numbers**:
    There are 8 numbers in the set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
3.  **Divide the sum by the count**:
    206 รท 8 = 25.75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>

Therefore, the mean of this set of numbers is 25.75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

The mean is one of several ways to represent the "middle" or [[mean_or_central_tendency_in_statistics | central tendency]] of a dataset, alongside the [[Median | median]] and [[Finding the mode | mode]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

Statistics involves understanding and making sense of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. It can broadly be classified into three categories: descriptive, predictive, and inferential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

*   **Descriptive Statistics**: This category involves summarizing and describing data without presenting all of it, often through indicative numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Inferential Statistics**: This involves using sampled data to draw conclusions or make inferences about a larger population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. For example, surveying a few people to understand how an entire population might vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Measures of Central Tendency

When faced with a set of numbers, a common goal in [[Descriptive statistics | descriptive statistics]] is to find a single number that is most indicative of the entire set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This concept is known as [[Central Tendency | central tendency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. These indicative numbers are also broadly referred to as [[Central Tendency and averages | averages]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

There are several ways to measure [[Central Tendency | central tendency]] or the [[Central Tendency and averages | average]] of a set of numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. The most common [[Measures of central tendency | measures of central tendency]] are the mean, the median, and the mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. These can all represent a data set's or a population's [[Central Tendency | central tendency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. In everyday language, when people mention "average," they typically refer to the arithmetic mean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

### The Mean

The [[Calculating mean | mean]], specifically the arithmetic mean, is calculated by adding up all the numbers in a set and then dividing by the total count of numbers in that set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

**Example 1:**
Consider the set of numbers: 1, 1, 2, 3, 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
To [[Calculating mean | calculate the mean]]:
Sum = 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>
Count = 5 numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>
Mean = 11 / 5 = 2.2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>

The mean of 2.2 is considered a good representative number for this set, indicating its [[mean and central tendency | central tendency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

### The Median

The [[Understanding median | median]] is found by arranging the numbers in a set in order and then identifying the middle number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. This requires very little computation beyond sorting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

**Example 1 (continued):**
For the set: 1, 1, 2, 3, 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
Since there are five numbers (an odd count), the middle number is 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. There are two numbers less than 2 and two numbers greater than 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
The [[Understanding median | median]] of this set is 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

**Example for an Even Number of Data Points:**
If a set has an even number of data points, there isn't a single middle number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. In this case, you take the two middle numbers and calculate their arithmetic mean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
For the set: 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
The two middle numbers are 2 and 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
The [[Understanding median | median]] would be (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

### The Mode

The [[Understanding mode | mode]] is the number that appears most frequently in a set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. It is often the easiest measure to determine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

**Example 1 (continued):**
For the set: 1, 1, 2, 3, 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
The number 1 appears twice, while all other numbers appear once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
The [[Identifying mode | mode]] of this set is 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

**Ambiguity with Multiple Modes:**
Sometimes, a set can have more than one mode if two or more numbers appear with the same highest frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
For example, in the set: 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4 <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Both 1 and 4 appear twice. In such cases, the mode could be considered 1, or 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Usually, test questions will avoid this ambiguity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

## Impact of Outliers on Central Tendency Measures

Different [[Measures of central tendency | measures of central tendency]] can provide different insights into a data set, especially when an [[Outlier | outlier]] is present. An [[Outlier | outlier]] is a number that stands out significantly from the rest of the data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

**Example 2: Set with an Outlier**
Consider the set of numbers: 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

*   **Mean Calculation:**
    Sum = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 100 = 115 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>
    Count = 6 numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>
    Mean = 115 / 6 â‰ˆ 19.17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>

    In this example, the mean (approximately 19.17) does not seem very representative of the set, as most numbers are 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. The value of 100 heavily skews the arithmetic mean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

*   **Median Calculation:**
    The numbers in order are already: 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
    Since there are six numbers (an even count), the two middle numbers are both 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
    Median = (3 + 3) / 2 = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>

    The [[Understanding median | median]] (3) is a much better representation of the [[Central Tendency | central tendency]] of this set because it is not as affected by the [[Outlier | outlier]] (100) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. For example, if discussing average home prices in a city where most houses are $100,000 but one costs a trillion dollars, the median price ($100,000) would give a more accurate perception than a skewed mean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

*   **Mode Calculation:**
    The most common number in the set (3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 100) is 3, appearing five times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
    The [[Understanding mode | mode]] is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

In this scenario, both the [[Understanding median | median]] and the [[Understanding mode | mode]] provide a more indicative measure of the data's [[Central Tendency | central tendency]] compared to the arithmetic mean, as they are less influenced by the [[Outlier | outlier]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. These measures are human constructs, mathematical tools designed to help us understand and interpret large sets of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

Future discussions will explore other [[Descriptive statistics | descriptive statistics]], such as how spread apart data points are from their [[Central Tendency | central tendency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

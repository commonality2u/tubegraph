## What is Statistics?
Statistics generally involves getting your head around data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. It can be broadly classified into three categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>:
*   **Descriptive Statistics**: This involves finding indicative numbers that represent a large set of data without presenting all of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Predictive Statistics**: Grouped with inferential statistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **Inferential Statistics**: Uses data, often from samples, to make conclusions about larger populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. For example, surveying a sample of voters to infer about the entire voting population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Descriptive Statistics and [[measures_of_central_tendency | Central Tendency Measures]]
When describing a set of numbers, a common goal is to find a single number that is most indicative of or represents the entire set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This representative number indicates the [[central_tendency_in_statistics | central tendency]] of the data set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. The term "average" is often used synonymously with [[central_tendency_in_statistics | central tendency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

There are several ways to measure [[mean_and_central_tendency | central tendency]] or the average of a set of numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>:
*   [[mean_in_statistics | Mean]] (specifically [[arithmetic_mean | arithmetic mean]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>
*   [[median | Median]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>
*   [[understanding_mode | Mode]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>

These three measures can all represent a data set's [[central_tendency_in_statistics | central tendency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a> and can collectively be considered forms of an average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. In everyday language, when people refer to "the average," they are usually talking about the [[arithmetic_mean | arithmetic mean]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

### The [[arithmetic_mean | Arithmetic Mean]]
The [[arithmetic_mean | arithmetic mean]] is calculated by adding up all the numbers in a set and then dividing by the total count of numbers in that set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This is the most common interpretation of "average" in daily use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

**Example Set:** 1, 1, 2, 3, 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>
*   **Sum of numbers:** 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>
*   **Count of numbers:** 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>
*   **Mean:** 11 / 5 = 2.2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>

In this example, 2.2 is considered a good representative number for the set, indicating its [[central_tendency_in_statistics | central tendency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

### The [[median | Median]]
The [[median | median]] is found by arranging the numbers in a set in order and then identifying the middle number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

**Example Set (odd number of values):** 1, 1, 2, 3, 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>
*   **Ordered set:** 1, 1, **2**, 3, 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>
*   **Middle number:** 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>
    *   There are two numbers greater than 2 and two numbers less than 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
*   **Median:** 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>

**Example Set (even number of values):** 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>
*   **Ordered set:** 1, 1, **2, 3**, 4, 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>
*   When there's an even number of values, there is no single middle number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **[[calculating_the_median | To calculate the median]]**: Take the two middle numbers (2 and 3) and find their [[arithmetic_mean | arithmetic mean]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
    *   (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>
*   **Median:** 2.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>

### The [[understanding_mode | Mode]]
The [[understanding_mode | mode]] is the number that appears most frequently in a set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. It is often the measure of [[central_tendency_in_statistics | central tendency]] that people forget or confuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

**Example Set:** 1, 1, 2, 3, 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>
*   In this set, '1' appears twice, while other numbers appear only once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
*   **Mode:** 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>

**Example Set with multiple modes:** 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>
*   Here, both '1' and '4' appear twice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
*   In such cases, the mode can be either 1 or 4, or it can be described as bimodal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. Ambiguity in the mode often requires clarification from the person asking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

## Comparing Mean, Median, and Mode: The Impact of Outliers
The choice of which [[measures_of_central_tendency | central tendency measure]] to use depends on the data and what you want to convey.

**Example Set with an Outlier:** 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>

*   **Mean:** (3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 100) / 6 = 115 / 6 = 19 and 1/6 (approx. 19.17) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
    *   This [[mean_in_statistics | mean]] doesn't seem truly representative of the set, as most numbers are 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. The value 100, which is very different from the others, is an [[outlier]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. The [[arithmetic_mean | arithmetic mean]] is "skewed" by this outlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

*   **Median:** For the ordered set (3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 100), the middle two numbers are both 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
    *   The [[arithmetic_mean | arithmetic mean]] of 3 and 3 is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
    *   **Median:** 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.
    *   The [[median | median]] is a better measure of [[central_tendency_in_statistics | central tendency]] in this case because it is less affected by the outlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. For example, if discussing home prices, where most houses are $100,000 but one costs a trillion dollars, the median would accurately reflect typical prices, while the mean would be misleading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

*   **Mode:** The most common number in the set (3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 100) is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
    *   **Mode:** 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.
    *   Similar to the [[median | median]], the [[understanding_mode | mode]] also provides a good indication of the numbers in the set, as it focuses on the most frequent value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

The mean, median, and mode are all human constructs designed to help understand large data sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. They serve as mathematical tools to summarize and interpret numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

## Next Steps in Descriptive Statistics
Future discussions in descriptive statistics will explore how spread apart data points are from their [[mean_and_central_tendency | central tendency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

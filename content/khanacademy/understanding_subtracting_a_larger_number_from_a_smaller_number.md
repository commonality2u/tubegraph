From: [[khanacademy]] <br/> 

When a larger number is subtracted from a smaller number, the result will always be a negative number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This concept can be easily visualized using a [[number_line_technique_for_addition_and_subtraction | number line]].

## Examples

### Positive Smaller Number Minus Positive Larger Number
Consider the expression `2 - 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.
*   **Starting Point:** Begin at positive 2 on the [[number_line_technique_for_addition_and_subtraction | number line]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   **Operation:** Subtracting 3 means moving 3 units to the left on the [[number_line_technique_for_addition_and_subtraction | number line]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Result:** Moving 1, 2, then 3 units to the left from 2 lands at negative 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
    *   Therefore, `2 - 3 = -1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

### Negative Number Minus Positive Number
Consider the expression `negative 2 - 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This extends the idea of moving left on the [[number_line_technique_for_addition_and_subtraction | number line]] when subtracting.
*   **Starting Point:** Begin at negative 2 on the [[number_line_technique_for_addition_and_subtraction | number line]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **Operation:** Subtracting 3 means moving 3 units to the left from negative 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Result:** Moving 1, 2, then 3 units to the left from negative 2 lands at negative 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
    *   Therefore, `negative 2 - 3 = -5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

### Adding a Positive Number to a Negative Number
Consider the expression `negative 2 + 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Starting Point:** Start at negative 2 on the [[number_line_technique_for_addition and subtraction | number line]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   **Operation:** Adding 3 means moving 3 units to the right on the [[number_line_technique_for_addition_and_subtraction | number line]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Result:** Moving 1, 2, then 3 units to the right from negative 2 lands at positive 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
    *   Therefore, `negative 2 + 3 = 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

### [[subtracting_negative_numbers | Subtracting a Negative Number]]
Subtracting a negative number is equivalent to [[adding negative numbers | adding]] a positive number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

*   **Example 1: `2 - negative 3`**
    *   This is the same as `2 + 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
    *   Result: `5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

*   **Example 2: `negative 2 - negative 3`**
    *   Despite the multiple negatives, this is the same as `negative 2 + 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
    *   As shown above, `negative 2 + 3 = 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

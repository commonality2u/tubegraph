[[introduction_to_trigonometry | Trigonometry]] is the study of the ratios of sides of triangles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The term "trig" in [[introduction_to_trigonometry | trigonometry]] means triangle, and "metry" means measure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This article introduces the [[introduction_to_basic_trigonometry | basics of trigonometry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, focusing on right triangles and the fundamental [[Trigonometric Functions and Right Triangles | trigonometric functions]]: sine, cosine, and tangent.

## Understanding Right Triangles

A right triangle is a triangle where one of its angles measures 90 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This 90-degree angle is also called a right angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

Key components of a right triangle:
*   **Right Angle**: The 90-degree angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   **Hypotenuse**: This is the side opposite the right angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a> and is always the longest side of a right triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. A hypotenuse only exists in a right triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **Other Sides**: The two shorter sides forming the right angle.

### Pythagorean Theorem
For any right triangle, the squares of the lengths of the two shorter sides sum up to the square of the length of the hypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. For example, if sides are 3 and 4, and the hypotenuse is 5, then 3² + 4² = 5² (9 + 16 = 25) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## The Core Trigonometric Functions

The primary [[Trigonometric Functions and Right Triangles | trigonometric functions]] are:
*   **Sine** (sin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>
*   **Cosine** (cos) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>
*   **Tangent** (tan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>

These functions define ratios of specific sides in a right triangle relative to a chosen angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

### SOH CAH TOA: The Mnemonic

A helpful mnemonic to remember the [[Trigonometric functions definition for right triangles | definitions of these functions]] is [[Using soh cah toa to determine trigonometric ratios | SOH CAH TOA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>:

*   **SOH**: **S**ine = **O**pposite / **H**ypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>
*   **CAH**: **C**osine = **A**djacent / **H**ypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>
*   **TOA**: **T**angent = **O**pposite / **A**djacent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>

When using these definitions, "opposite" and "adjacent" refer to the sides relative to a *specific* angle in the triangle (excluding the right angle). The hypotenuse is always the same side.

## Calculating Trigonometric Ratios

Let's illustrate the [[Calculation of sine cosine and tangent | calculation of sine, cosine, and tangent]] using a 3-4-5 right triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Example 1: Angle Theta

Consider a right triangle with sides 3, 4, and a hypotenuse of 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Let's find the trigonometric ratios for angle `theta` (θ), which is formed by the side of length 4 and the hypotenuse of length 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

![Right triangle with sides 3, 4, 5. Angle theta is between side 4 and hypotenuse 5.](https://i.imgur.com/example_triangle_theta.png)

*   **Opposite side** to theta: 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>
*   **Adjacent side** to theta: 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>
*   **Hypotenuse**: 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>

Using [[Using soh cah toa to determine trigonometric ratios | SOH CAH TOA]]:
*   **Sine of theta (sin θ)** = Opposite / Hypotenuse = 3 / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>
*   **Cosine of theta (cos θ)** = Adjacent / Hypotenuse = 4 / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>
*   **Tangent of theta (tan θ)** = Opposite / Adjacent = 3 / 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>

If this angle (theta) has a certain measure, the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse (3/5) will *always* be the same for that specific angle, regardless of the triangle's size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

### Example 2: Angle X

Now, let's consider the same 3-4-5 right triangle, but focus on the other acute angle, `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

![Right triangle with sides 3, 4, 5. Angle x is between side 3 and hypotenuse 5.](https://i.imgur.com/example_triangle_x.png)

*   **Opposite side** to x: 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>
*   **Adjacent side** to x: 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>
*   **Hypotenuse**: 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>

Using [[Using soh cah toa to determine trigonometric ratios | SOH CAH TOA]]:
*   **Sine of x (sin x)** = Opposite / Hypotenuse = 4 / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>
*   **Cosine of x (cos x)** = Adjacent / Hypotenuse = 3 / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>
*   **Tangent of x (tan x)** = Opposite / Adjacent = 4 / 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>

## Looking Ahead

The [[Using soh cah toa to determine trigonometric ratios | SOH CAH TOA definition]] is very effective for angles between 0 and 90 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. More advanced definitions, derived from [[Using soh cah toa to determine trigonometric ratios | SOH CAH TOA]], are used to [[Finding Sine Cosine and Tangent | find the sine, cosine, and tangent]] of any angle, including those greater than 90 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

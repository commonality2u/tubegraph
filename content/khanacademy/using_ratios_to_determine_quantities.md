Ratios are mathematical expressions used to [[comparing_quantities_using_ratios | compare quantities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. They indicate how much of one quantity there is relative to another quantity or quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Expressing Ratios

Ratios can be expressed in several ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>:
*   Using a colon (e.g., 10:5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>
*   As a [[representation_of_rational_numbers_as_fractions | fraction]] (e.g., 10/5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>
*   Using the word "to" (e.g., 10 to 5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>

### Example: Horses and Dogs
If you have 10 horses and 5 dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>:
*   The ratio of horses to dogs can be written as 10:5, 10/5, or 10 to 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   The first quantity mentioned (horses) corresponds to the first number in the ratio, or the numerator if expressed as a [[representation_of_rational_numbers_as_fractions | fraction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## [[reducing_ratios_to_simplest_form | Reducing Ratios]]

Ratios can often be simplified to their [[reducing_ratios_to_simplest_form | reduced form]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. This is done by [[dividing_to_solve_equations | dividing]] each quantity in the ratio by their greatest common divisor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### Example: Horses and Dogs (Reduced)
Using the previous example of 10 horses and 5 dogs:
*   The ratio 10:5 can be [[reducing_ratios_to_simplest_form | reduced]] by [[dividing_to_solve_equations | dividing]] both numbers by 5 (their greatest common divisor) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   This results in a [[reducing_ratios_to_simplest_form | reduced ratio]] of 2:1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. This means for every 2 horses, there is 1 dog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   The convention is to use the [[reducing_ratios_to_simplest_form | simplest form]] for ratios and fractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

### Order of Quantities in Ratios
The order in which quantities are mentioned in a ratio is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   Ratio of horses to dogs: 10:5 (or 2:1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>
*   Ratio of dogs to horses: 5:10 (or 1:2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. This means for every 1 dog, there are 2 horses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## [[complex_ratio_problems_improving_multiple_quantities | Ratios with Multiple Quantities]]

Ratios can compare more than two quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
### Example: Apples, Oranges, Strawberries
If you have 20 apples, 40 oranges, and 60 strawberries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>:
*   The ratio of apples to oranges to strawberries is 20:40:60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   To [[reducing_ratios_to_simplest_form | reduce]] this ratio, find the largest number that divides into all three quantities. In this case, it's 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   [[Dividing_to_solve_equations | Dividing]] each by 20, the [[reducing_ratios_to_simplest_form | reduced ratio]] is 1:2:3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   This means for every 1 apple, there are 2 oranges and 3 strawberries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   If the order of items is changed (e.g., strawberries to oranges to apples), the order of the numbers in the ratio must also change (3:2:1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

## Using Ratios to Determine Unknown Quantities

Ratios can be used to find the number of individual items when the total quantity and the ratio are known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

### Example: Boys and Girls in a Classroom
Suppose the ratio of boys to girls in a classroom is 2:3 (or 2/3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, and there are a total of 40 students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. To find out how many girls there are:

1.  **Determine the "group size" from the ratio:** For every 2 boys, there are 3 girls. This means for every (2 + 3) = 5 students, there are 2 boys and 3 girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
2.  **Calculate the number of "groups":** [[Dividing_to_solve_equations | Divide]] the total number of students by the group size: 40 students / 5 students per group = 8 groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.
3.  **Find the quantity of the desired item:** Each group contains 3 girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. Multiply the number of groups by the number of girls per group: 8 groups * 3 girls/group = 24 girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

Similarly, there would be 8 groups * 2 boys/group = 16 boys, or 40 total students - 24 girls = 16 boys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

### Example: Animals on a Farm (Multiple Quantities)
If the ratio of sheep to chickens to pigs on a farm is 2:5:10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, and there are 51 total animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. To find the number of chickens:

1.  **Determine the "group size":** Add the parts of the ratio: 2 + 5 + 10 = 17 animals per group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.
2.  **Calculate the number of "groups":** [[Dividing_to_solve_equations | Divide]] the total animals by the group size: 51 animals / 17 animals per group = 3 groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.
3.  **Find the quantity of chickens:** Each group has 5 chickens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. Multiply the number of groups by the number of chickens per group: 3 groups * 5 chickens/group = 15 chickens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.

This process can be applied to find the number of sheep or pigs as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

Adam Smith, a Scottish philosopher, is considered by many to be the first real economist in the modern sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. His influential work, *The Wealth of Nations*, was published in 1776, coincidentally the same year as the American Declaration of Independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## The Invisible Hand
One of Smith's most famous concepts, articulated in *The Wealth of Nations*, is that of the "invisible hand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. He posits that an economic actor, "neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Instead, by directing their industry in a manner that maximizes the value of its produce, the actor "intends only his own gain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

Smith argues that in pursuing their own self-interest, individuals are "led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This means that when individual actors operate solely out of self-interest, their collective actions can often lead to outcomes that none of them specifically intended, and which can be beneficial for society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Smith states that it is not always a negative outcome for society when an individual's actions are not explicitly intended for the public good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. In fact, he suggests that by pursuing their own interest, an individual "frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Core of Capitalism and its Influence
This concept forms a strong statement that lies at the core of [[capitalism | capitalism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. The foundational ideas of capitalism, as presented by Adam Smith, have profoundly influenced the United States, arguably as much as the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

While Smith would likely not claim that self-interested actions are always beneficial, or that individuals should never consider the broader implications of their actions, he frequently suggested that self-interested behavior *could* lead to a greater good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This includes outcomes such as:
*   More innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>
*   Better investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>
*   Increased productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>
*   More wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>
*   A larger "pie" for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>

Smith's statements embody a mix of [[microeconomics_and_macroeconomics | microeconomic]] and [[microeconomics_and_macroeconomics | macroeconomic]] principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. The idea that individual actors operate out of self-interest is [[microeconomics_and_macroeconomics | microeconomic]] in nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>, while the notion that this can benefit the economy or nation as a whole is [[microeconomics_and_macroeconomics | macroeconomic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Modern Economic Thought and Limitations
Modern [[introduction_to_economics | economics]] seeks to make these concepts rigorous and mathematical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. This often involves simplifying complex human behaviors, such as assuming that all people are rational or always act to maximize their gain, to develop [[economics_and_mathematical_models | mathematical models]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. While this can clarify thinking and allow for proving propositions based on assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>, it carries risks. [[economics_and_mathematical_models | Mathematical models]] can lead to strong conclusions based on oversimplifications or incorrect assumptions, which may not apply to real-world contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

It is crucial to remember that economic models are based on simplifying assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. [[microeconomics_and_macroeconomics | Macroeconomics]] is particularly prone to this, as it attempts to aggregate the actions of millions of complex individuals and their unpredictable interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. While [[economics_and_mathematical_models | mathematical models]] are valuable for clarifying intuition, they should always be taken "with a grain of salt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

As publisher Alfred Knopf quipped, "An economist is a man who states the obvious in terms of the incomprehensible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. This highlights the importance of retaining intuition about common-sense economic principles, even when delving into complex mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Additionally, Lawrence J. Peter noted, "An economist is an expert who will know tomorrow why the things he predicted yesterday didn't happen today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. This underscores the predictive challenges, especially in [[microeconomics_and_macroeconomics | macroeconomics]], and reminds us that economics is not a precise science like physics; it is subject to subjectivity based on chosen assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

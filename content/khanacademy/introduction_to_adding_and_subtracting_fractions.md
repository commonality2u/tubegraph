This article introduces the fundamental concepts of [[adding fractions with different denominators | adding]] and [[Subtracting fractions with the same denominator | subtracting fractions]], starting with cases where denominators are the same and progressing to cases with different denominators.

## Understanding Fraction Components

In a fraction, the **denominator** is the bottom number, representing the total number of pieces in a whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, while the **numerator** is the top number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

## [[Adding fractions with the same denominator | Adding Fractions with the Same Denominator]]

When adding fractions with the same denominator, the process is straightforward:
1.  The denominator (bottom number) remains the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
2.  The numerators (top numbers) are added together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

### Example: 1/4 + 1/4

Consider eating pie: if you eat 1/4 of a pie and then another 1/4 of the same pie, you have eaten 2 out of the 4 pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
Mathematically: 1/4 + 1/4 = 2/4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
This can be [[Simplifying fractions | simplified]] to 1/2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

### Example: 2/5 + 1/5

Similarly, to add 2/5 and 1/5:
*   Check that denominators are the same (in this case, 5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   The denominator of the answer will be 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   Add the numerators: 2 + 1 = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   Result: 3/5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## [[Subtracting fractions with the same denominator | Subtracting Fractions with the Same Denominator]]

Subtraction follows the same rule as addition for fractions with the same denominator:
1.  The denominator stays the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
2.  Subtract the numerators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### Example: 3/7 - 2/7

If you have 3 out of 7 pieces of pie and give away 2 out of 7 pieces, you are left with 1 of the 7 pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
Mathematically: 3/7 - 2/7 = 1/7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## [[Adding fractions with different denominators | Adding Fractions with Different Denominators]]

When adding fractions with different denominators, you must first convert them so they share a **common denominator** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

### Example: 1/4 + 1/2

To add 1/4 and 1/2:
1.  **Find a Common Denominator**: The goal is to make the denominators the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Notice that 1/2 can be rewritten as 2/4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
    *   To change 1/2 to 2/4, multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. You can always multiply a fraction's numerator and denominator by the same non-zero number without changing its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
2.  **Add the Fractions**: Now the problem becomes 1/4 + 2/4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
    *   Add the numerators (1 + 2 = 3) and keep the denominator (4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.
    *   Result: 3/4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

### Example: 1/2 + 1/3

Sometimes, neither denominator is a multiple of the other, requiring you to change both fractions:
1.  **Find the Least Common Multiple (LCM)**: Determine the smallest number that is a multiple of both denominators (2 and 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. The LCM of 2 and 3 is 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
2.  **Convert Both Fractions**:
    *   For 1/2, to get a denominator of 6, multiply the numerator and denominator by 3 (since 2 * 3 = 6). So, 1/2 becomes 3/6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
    *   For 1/3, to get a denominator of 6, multiply the numerator and denominator by 2 (since 3 * 2 = 6). So, 1/3 becomes 2/6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
3.  **Add the Converted Fractions**: Now the problem is 3/6 + 2/6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
    *   Add the numerators (3 + 2 = 5) and keep the denominator (6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
    *   Result: 5/6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

## [[Subtracting fractions with different denominators | Subtracting Fractions with Different Denominators]]

The same principle of finding a common denominator applies to subtraction of fractions with different denominators.

### Example: 1/2 - 1/3

Using the conversions from the previous example:
1.  Convert 1/2 to 3/6.
2.  Convert 1/3 to 2/6.
3.  Subtract the converted fractions: 3/6 - 2/6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
    *   Subtract the numerators (3 - 2 = 1) and keep the denominator (6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
    *   Result: 1/6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

### Working with Whole Numbers

Sometimes you might need to subtract a whole number from a fraction, or vice-versa. To do this, represent the whole number as a fraction with the desired denominator.

#### Example: 1/10 - 1

To solve 1/10 - 1:
1.  Rewrite the whole number 1 as a fraction with a denominator of 10: 10/10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
2.  The problem becomes 1/10 - 10/10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
3.  Subtract the numerators (1 - 10 = -9) and keep the denominator (10) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
4.  Result: -9/10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

### Example with Negative Fractions: -1/9 - 1/4

1.  **Find the LCM**: The least common multiple of 9 and 4 is 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
2.  **Convert Fractions to Common Denominator**:
    *   For -1/9: Multiply numerator and denominator by 4 to get -4/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
    *   For 1/4: Multiply numerator and denominator by 9 to get 9/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
3.  **Perform Subtraction**: The problem is now -4/36 - 9/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
    *   Subtract the numerators (-4 - 9 = -13) and keep the denominator (36) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
    *   Result: -13/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

[[solving_algebraic_equations | Solving algebraic equations]] can involve equations where the variable appears on both sides. These might initially seem complex, but they can be solved systematically by [[isolating_variables_in_algebraic_equations | isolating the variable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The fundamental principle is to [[balanding_equations_by_performing_operations_on_both_sides | perform the same operations on both sides of the equation]] until the variable is isolated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Visualizing the steps can help in [[systematic_approach_to_solving_equations | understanding what operations are allowed]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Example Equation

Consider the equation: `2x + 3 = 5x - 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
This equation has `x` values on both the left and right sides, along with constant numbers being added and subtracted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Step-by-Step Solution

The goal is to [[isolating_variables_in_algebraic_equations | isolate the x]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

### Step 1: Get Variables on One Side

To begin, consolidate the `x` terms on one side of the equation. One reasonable approach is to subtract `2x` from both sides, as this will result in a positive number of `x`'s on the right side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

*   **Algebraic Step:**
    ```
    2x + 3 = 5x - 2
    -2x        -2x
    ----------------
    3 = 3x - 2
    ```
*   **Explanation:** By subtracting `2x` from both sides, the `2x` on the left cancels out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. On the right, `5x - 2x` simplifies to `3x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **Visual Representation:** If you imagine `2x` (two 'x' blocks) and `3` (three '+1' blocks) on the left, and `5x` (five 'x' blocks) and `-2` (two '-1' blocks) on the right, removing two 'x' blocks from each side maintains the balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

### Step 2: Get Constants on the Other Side

Now that the `x` terms are on one side, move the constant terms to the opposite side. In this case, to [[solving_linear_equations_with_addition_and_subtraction | remove the -2]] from the right side, add `2` to both sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

*   **Algebraic Step:**
    ```
    3 = 3x - 2
    +2       +2
    ----------------
    5 = 3x
    ```
*   **Explanation:** Adding `2` to `3` on the left results in `5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. On the right, `-2 + 2` cancels out, leaving only `3x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Visual Representation:** Adding two '+1' blocks to both sides will cancel out the two '-1' blocks on the right, leaving only the 'x' blocks balanced against the constant blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### Step 3: Isolate the Variable

The final step is to [[isolating_variables_in_algebraic_equations | isolate `x`]] by removing its coefficient. Since `x` is being multiplied by `3`, divide both sides of the equation by `3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

*   **Algebraic Step:**
    ```
    5 = 3x
    --- ---
     3   3
    ```
    This results in: `5/3 = x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   **Explanation:** Dividing `3x` by `3` leaves `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. The left side becomes the fraction `5/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   **Final Answer:** `x = 5/3` or `x = 1 2/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. It is perfectly acceptable for `x` to be on the right side of the equation; `5/3 = x` is equivalent to `x = 5/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

## Conclusion

By systematically [[balanding_equations_by_performing_operations_on_both_sides | applying operations to both sides of the equation]], even complex linear equations with variables on both sides can be solved to find the value of the unknown variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. The key is to remember the objective of [[isolating_variables_in_algebraic_equations | isolating the variable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

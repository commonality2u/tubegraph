[[solving_linear_equations | Solving equations]] that have variables on both sides, such as `2x + 3 = 5x - 2`, might initially appear daunting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. However, the core principle remains the same: to [[isolating_the_variable_in_an_equation | isolate the variable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Once you have `x` equal to a value, you have [[solving_linear_equations | solved the equation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This is achieved by performing a series of operations on both sides of the equation to eventually [[isolating_the_variable_in_an_equation | isolate the x]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

While visualizing the equation can help understand what's occurring, it's not strictly necessary for solving the problem; only the [[using_algebraic_steps_to_solve_equations | algebraic steps]] are required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. As long as legitimate operations are performed, the correct answer will be obtained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## Steps to Solve

Consider the equation: `2x + 3 = 5x - 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

### 1. Consolidate Variables

To begin, you want to [[isolating_the_variable_in_an_equation | isolate the x's]] on one side of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. A common approach is to subtract the variable term with the smaller coefficient from both sides.
*   Subtract `2x` from both sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
    ```
    2x + 3 - 2x = 5x - 2 - 2x
    ```
*   This simplifies the equation:
    *   On the left side, `2x` and `-2x` cancel out, leaving `3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
    *   On the right side, `5x - 2x` becomes `3x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
    ```
    3 = 3x - 2
    ```

### 2. Isolate the Variable Term

Next, eliminate the constant term from the side containing the variable.
*   To remove `-2` from the right side, add `2` to both sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
    ```
    3 + 2 = 3x - 2 + 2
    ```
*   This simplifies to:
    *   On the left side, `3 + 2` equals `5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
    *   On the right side, `-2` and `+2` cancel out, leaving `3x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
    ```
    5 = 3x
    ```

### 3. Solve for the Variable

Finally, divide both sides by the coefficient of `x`.
*   [[dividing_to_solve_equations | Divide both sides of the equation by 3]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. The reason for [[dividing_to_solve_equations | dividing by 3]] is that `x` is being multiplied by `3`, which is its coefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
    ```
    5 / 3 = 3x / 3
    ```
*   This yields the solution:
    ```
    5/3 = x
    ```
    or, written in a more conventional format:
    ```
    x = 5/3
    ```
    This is completely equivalent to `x = 5/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. As a mixed number, `5/3` can be expressed as `1 2/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.
    ```
    x = 1 2/3
    ```

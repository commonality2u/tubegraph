When approaching a more complex equation, such as one with variables on both sides, the core objective remains the same: to [[isolating_a_variable_in_an_equation | isolate the variable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Once the variable (e.g., x) is isolated, the equation is solved, and the solution can be checked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This process involves performing a series of [[operations_on_both_sides_of_an_equation | operations on both sides of the equation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Visualizing these operations can help understand *why* certain steps are allowed and prevent confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Example: `2x + 3 = 5x - 2`

Let's [[solving_equations_with_variables | solve the equation]] `2x + 3 = 5x - 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

### Step 1: Consolidate Variables on One Side

The first goal is to gather all the variable terms (x's) onto a single side of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

There are multiple valid approaches:
*   Subtract `2x` from both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. This is often preferred if it keeps the variable's coefficient positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   Subtract `5x` from both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

Let's subtract `2x` from both sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>:

```
2x + 3 = 5x - 2
-2x      -2x
```

On the left side, `2x - 2x` cancels out, leaving `3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
On the right side, `5x - 2x` simplifies to `3x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

The equation becomes: `3 = 3x - 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

### Step 2: Consolidate Constants on the Other Side

Now, with all the variable terms on one side, the next step is to move all constant terms to the opposite side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. In our current equation, we want to eliminate the `-2` from the right side to further [[isolating_a_variable_in_an_equation | isolate the x]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

To remove `-2`, we add `2` to both sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>:

```
3 = 3x - 2
+2       +2
```

On the left side, `3 + 2` equals `5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
On the right side, `-2 + 2` cancels out, leaving `3x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

The equation is now: `5 = 3x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

### Step 3: Isolate the Variable by Division

The final step in [[isolating_a_variable_in_an_equation | isolating the variable]] is to divide both sides by the coefficient of x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. The coefficient is the number multiplying the variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. In `5 = 3x`, the coefficient of x is `3`.

[[dividing_both_sides_of_an_equation | Divide both sides]] by `3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>:

```
5 / 3 = 3x / 3
```

On the left side, `5 / 3` remains `5/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
On the right side, `3x / 3` simplifies to `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

So, the solution is `5/3 = x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

It is completely acceptable to have the variable on the right side of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. This is equivalent to `x = 5/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

This fractional answer can also be expressed as a mixed number: `1 2/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

Thus, `x = 5/3` or `x = 1 2/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

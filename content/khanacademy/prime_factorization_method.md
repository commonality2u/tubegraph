The prime factorization method is one approach used to determine the [[finding_the_least_common_multiple | least common multiple]] (LCM) of two or more numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This method involves breaking down each number into its prime factors and then constructing the smallest number that contains all the "ingredients" (prime factors) from both original numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## How it Works

To find the [[finding_the_least_common_multiple | least common multiple]] using prime factorization, follow these steps:

1.  **Find the prime factorization of each number** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
2.  **Construct the LCM** by including enough of each prime factor to cover all the factors present in both numbers, without adding any unnecessary factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

### Example: LCM of 18 and 12

Let's find the [[finding_the_least_common_multiple | least common multiple]] of 18 and 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

1.  **Prime Factorization:**
    *   18 can be factored as 2 times 9, and 9 is 3 times 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. So, the prime factorization of 18 is 2 × 3 × 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
    *   12 can be factored as 2 times 6, and 6 is 2 times 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. So, the prime factorization of 12 is 2 × 2 × 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

2.  **Construct the LCM:**
    *   The [[finding_the_least_common_multiple | least common multiple]] must contain enough prime factors to be divisible by both 18 and 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
    *   To be divisible by 18 (2 × 3 × 3), the LCM must include at least one 2, one 3, and another 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. So, we start with 2 × 3 × 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
    *   Now, consider 12 (2 × 2 × 3). We already have one 3 and one 2 from our initial set of factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. However, 12 requires *two* 2's, and we only have one currently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Therefore, we need to add one more 2 to our list of factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
    *   The complete set of prime factors for the LCM is 2 × 3 × 3 × 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
    *   Multiplying these factors: 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 = 4 × 3 × 3 = 12 × 3 = 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
    *   Thus, the [[finding_the_least_common_multiple | least common multiple]] of 18 and 12 is 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Advantages

While the "brute force" method of listing multiples can work for smaller numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, the prime factorization method offers several advantages:

*   **Systematic Approach:** It provides a structured way to find the LCM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   **Decomposition and Reconstruction:** It involves decomposing numbers into their fundamental components (prime factors) and then carefully rebuilding the smallest common multiple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   **Efficiency for Large Numbers:** This method is particularly useful and more efficient when dealing with very large or complex numbers, where listing out all multiples would be impractical and time-consuming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

The goal of understanding COVID-19 cases involves differentiating between the reported numbers and the estimated actual numbers of new cases in a given area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. While news outlets report confirmed cases daily, these numbers are based on individuals who have been tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. The actual number of cases is likely far larger than the reported confirmed cases, as many individuals may not have symptoms or their symptoms are not severe enough to warrant testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Why Reported Cases Underestimate Actual Cases

The discrepancy between reported and actual cases is significant due to testing limitations and delays in symptom onset and diagnosis.

### Hubei Province Example
Analysis of data from Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, visually demonstrates this difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   The **yellow bars** on a chart represent the number of confirmed new cases per day (people tested positive) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   The **gray bars** represent the actual number of new cases per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

For example, on January 23rd, 2020, Hubei province reported about 300 new confirmed cases, but the actual number of new cases for that day was closer to 2,500 â€“ roughly eight times higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

The actual number of cases was determined in hindsight by asking individuals who tested positive when they first experienced symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. If someone tested positive on January 23rd but reported symptoms starting on January 13th, they would be counted as an actual new case on January 13th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

### Impact of Shutdown Measures
When Wuhan was shut down on January 23rd, confirmed cases continued to rise due to a testing delay, but actual cases, calculated in hindsight, began to flatten and then decrease a few days later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This delay between symptom onset and testing is visible in the data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

Before the city shutdown, as of January 22nd, the total actual cases in Hubei (sum of gray bars) were approximately 12,000, while total confirmed cases (sum of yellow bars) were only about 444 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. This highlights how a far higher number of cases existed than reported, even with China's relatively good testing at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

### [[impact_of_testing_limitations_on_reported_covid19_cases | Testing Limitations]]
In many geographies, the ratio of actual to confirmed cases is likely higher than observed in Hubei because testing rates are lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. For example, as of March 3rd, 2020, the United States had a low number of tests performed per million citizens compared to other regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. This means that reported cases in places like the United States significantly understate the actual number of cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

## [[estimating_actual_covid19_cases_using_mortality_data | Estimating Actual Cases]] Using Mortality Data

One method to estimate the actual number of cases involves using the number of deaths and epidemiological estimates for mortality rate, time from infection to death, and the virus's spread rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

### Key Assumptions
Based on analysis by Thomas Pueyo, the following estimates can be used for calculations:
*   **Mortality Rate**: Approximately 1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. This rate varies globally, from as low as 0.6% in South Korea to around 5% in Iran, influenced by the capacity of hospital systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   **Time from Infection to Death**: Roughly 20 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. This includes an estimated 5-day incubation period (infection to symptom onset) and another 15 days from symptom onset to death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   **Days to Doubling**: A conservative estimate of 5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This rate depends heavily on population density and interaction levels, with social isolation measures able to lower it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

### Calculation Example: One Death in a Region
Consider a scenario where one death is reported in a region today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
1.  **Infection Date**: Given an average time of 20 days from infection to death, the individual likely contracted the virus approximately 20 days ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
2.  **Estimated Initial Infections**: Assuming a 1% mortality rate, that one death implies approximately 100 people were infected 20 days ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
    *   If the mortality rate was 0.5%, it would suggest 200 people infected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
    *   If the mortality rate was 5%, it would suggest 20 people infected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
3.  **Current Cases (Exponential Growth)**: If the infection rate doubles every five days, and assuming the 100 initial infections 20 days ago were the only cases:
    *   **15 days ago (after 5 days)**: 200 total cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>
    *   **10 days ago (after 10 days)**: 400 total cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>
    *   **5 days ago (after 15 days)**: 800 total cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>
    *   **Today (after 20 days)**: Approximately 1,600 total cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>

This calculation demonstrates that even a single reported death could imply a significantly higher number of current infections in the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. The accuracy of these backward estimates improves as the number of deaths in a region increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

## Takeaways

*   The data presented on new cases is often a lagging indicator, meaning the actual situation on the ground is more severe than reported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.
*   The actual number of infected persons can be at least a factor of ten, or even higher (e.g., 1,000-3,000 people), than the reported cases, especially in areas with limited testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.
*   Taking precautions such as social isolation is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. If the spread rate is lowered, it can prevent the healthcare system from being overwhelmed, thereby keeping the mortality rate as low as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.
*   Complacency due to lagging reported data and insufficient testing can lead to overwhelming the hospital system, which would cause the mortality rate to increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

When performing [[fraction_calculation_methods | calculations involving fractions]], it is often necessary to reduce or [[simplifying_fractions | simplify fractions]] to their lowest terms. This can be done either after the calculation or, in some cases, before, to simplify the process.

## Multiplying Fractions

To multiply fractions, the numerators are multiplied together, and the denominators are multiplied together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. For example, to multiply 5/6 by 2/3:
*   The new numerator is 5 times 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   The new denominator is 6 times 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

This results in:
5/6 × 2/3 = (5 × 2) / (6 × 3) = 10/18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## [[simplifying_fractions | Simplifying Fractions]] After Multiplication

After multiplying fractions, the resulting fraction may not be in its lowest terms. To [[simplifying_fractions | simplify the fraction]], identify any common factors shared by both the numerator and the denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Divide both by their greatest common factor.

For the example of 10/18:
*   Both 10 and 18 are divisible by 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   Divide 10 by 2 to get 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   Divide 18 by 2 to get 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

Thus, 10/18 simplifies to 5/9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## [[simplifying_fractions | Simplifying Fractions]] Before Multiplication (Cross-Cancellation)

An alternative method is to [[simplifying_fractions | simplify the fractions]] before performing the multiplication, often referred to as cross-cancellation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This involves identifying common factors between any numerator and any denominator in the multiplication expression.

For the example of 5/6 × 2/3:
1.  Observe that the numerator 2 (from 2/3) and the denominator 6 (from 5/6) share a common factor of 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
2.  Divide the numerator 2 by 2, which leaves 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
3.  Divide the denominator 6 by 2, which leaves 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

The expression then becomes:
5/3 × 1/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

Now, multiply the modified fractions:
(5 × 1) / (3 × 3) = 5/9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

This method achieves the same result as [[simplifying_fractions | simplifying]] after multiplication but can make the numbers smaller and easier to work with during the multiplication step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Both methods are valid ways to obtain the simplified answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

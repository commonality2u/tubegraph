[[definition_of_trigonometry | Trigonometry]] is defined as the study of [[right_triangles_and_trigonometry | right triangles]] and the relationship between their sides and angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The term itself is thought to come from Ancient Greek, meaning "triangle measure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. [[introduction_to_basic_trigonometric_functions | Trigonometric functions]] reveal the ratios of a triangle's sides relative to a specific angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Core Trigonometric Functions: Sine, Cosine, and Tangent

The three [[core_trigonometric_functions_sine_cosine_and_tangent | core trigonometric functions]] are [[core_trigonometric_functions_sine_cosine_and_tangent | sine]] (sin), [[core_trigonometric_functions_sine_cosine_and_tangent | cosine]] (cos), and [[core_trigonometric_functions_sine_cosine_and_tangent | tangent]] (tan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. These functions help define the [[trigonometric_ratios_and_angle_identification | trigonometric ratios]] of a [[right_triangles_and_trigonometry | right triangle]].

### The SOH CAH TOA Mnemonic

To remember the definitions of these functions, a common mnemonic is **SOH CAH TOA** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **SOH**: **S**ine is **O**pposite over **H**ypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>
*   **CAH**: **C**osine is **A**djacent over **H**ypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>
*   **TOA**: **T**angent is **O**pposite over **A**djacent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>

### Identifying Sides in a Right Triangle

When calculating [[core_trigonometric_functions_sine_cosine_and_tangent | trigonometric functions]], it's crucial to correctly identify the sides relative to the chosen angle (often denoted as theta, θ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, a Greek letter commonly used for angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>):
*   **Opposite:** The side directly across from the angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   **Adjacent:** The side next to the angle that is *not* the hypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   **Hypotenuse:** The longest side of the [[right_triangles_and_trigonometry | right triangle]], always opposite the right angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

### Example Calculations using a 3-4-5 Right Triangle

Consider a [[right_triangles_and_trigonometry | right triangle]] with sides 3 and 4, and a hypotenuse of 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Let θ be one of the non-right angles, where the side of length 4 is opposite θ and the side of length 3 is adjacent to θ.

#### Sine of Theta (sin θ)

Using SOH (Opposite/Hypotenuse):
*   Opposite side to θ = 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>
*   Hypotenuse = 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>
*   sin θ = 4/5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>

#### Cosine of Theta (cos θ)

Using CAH (Adjacent/Hypotenuse):
*   Adjacent side to θ = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>
*   Hypotenuse = 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>
*   cos θ = 3/5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>

#### Tangent of Theta (tan θ)

Using TOA (Opposite/Adjacent):
*   Opposite side to θ = 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>
*   Adjacent side to θ = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>
*   tan θ = 4/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>

### Dependence on the Angle

The values of the [[core_trigonometric_functions_sine_cosine_and_tangent | trigonometric functions]] depend on which angle of the [[right_triangles_and_trigonometry | right triangle]] is being considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

For example, if we consider the *other* non-right angle in the same 3-4-5 triangle, let's call it 'x' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>:

#### Tangent of Angle X (tan x)

Using TOA (Opposite/Adjacent) for angle x:
*   Opposite side to x = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>
*   Adjacent side to x = 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>
*   tan x = 3/4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>

Notice that tan x (3/4) is the inverse of tan θ (4/3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>, demonstrating the importance of angle selection.

## [[practical_applications_of_trigonometry | Practical Applications]]

These [[core_trigonometric_functions_sine_cosine_and_tangent | trigonometric functions]] are powerful tools. If you know an angle and a side, or a couple of sides, you can use these functions along with a calculator, slide rule, or trig table to find unknown angles or other sides of a triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This will be explored further in subsequent lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

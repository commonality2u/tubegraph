Multiplication is a fundamental mathematical operation, often introduced as a simplified way of performing repeated [[introduction_to_basic_addition | addition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## Multiplication as Repeated Addition

Consider the expression "2 times 3" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This can be understood in two ways:

1.  **Adding the first number to itself the number of times indicated by the second number** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>:
    In "2 times 3", you add 2 to itself three times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
    2 + 2 + 2 = 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>

2.  **Adding the second number to itself the number of times indicated by the first number** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>:
    In "2 times 3", you can also add 3 to itself two times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
    3 + 3 = 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>

Both interpretations yield the same result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. This demonstrates a key [[multiplication_properties_and_concepts | property of multiplication]] where the order of the numbers does not change the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. For instance, 4 times 3 is the same as 3 times 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

Some teaching methods, particularly in the "English system," refer to "4 times 3" as "four 3's" or "three 4's," which can be more intuitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

## [[using_multiplication_for_efficient_counting | Using Multiplication for Efficient Counting]]

Multiplication is especially useful for quickly counting items arranged in rows and columns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

Consider an example with lemons:
If you have 4 rows of lemons, with 3 lemons in each row <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>:

*   **Row 1:** 3 lemons
*   **Row 2:** 3 lemons
*   **Row 3:** 3 lemons
*   **Row 4:** 3 lemons

Instead of counting each lemon individually (1, 2, 3, ... 12) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>, you can multiply the number of lemons per row by the number of rows: 4 rows * 3 lemons/row = 12 lemons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

This becomes significantly more efficient when dealing with larger quantities, such as 100 lemons per row and 100 rows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

## Special Cases in Multiplication

### Multiplying by One (1)

Any number multiplied by 1 results in that same number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

*   3 times 1 means "three 1's" (1 + 1 + 1 = 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.
*   It can also be seen as "3 one time," which is simply 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

For example:
*   3 x 1 = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>
*   100 x 1 = 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>
*   1 x 39 = 39 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>

### Multiplying by Zero (0)

Any number multiplied by 0 results in 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

*   4 times 0 means "zero four times" or "four 0's" (0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.
*   If you have 4 apples and multiply that by 0, you have no groups of apples, resulting in 0 apples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

For example:
*   4 x 0 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>
*   5,493,692 x 0 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>
*   0 x 17 = 0 <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>

The immune system is broadly categorized into two main branches: the [[innate_immune_system_and_first_line_barriers | nonspecific or innate immune system]] and the specific or adaptive immune system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. While the [[innate_immune_system_and_first_line_barriers | innate immune system]] provides immediate, general protection, the specific immune system offers targeted, memory-based defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## Distinction from the Innate Immune System

The [[innate_immune_system_and_first_line_barriers | innate immune system]] acts as the first and second lines of defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>:
*   **First Line Barriers:** These are physical and chemical barriers that prevent pathogens from entering the body, such as skin, stomach acid, and the acidity of skin oils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   **Second Line of Defense:** Once pathogens bypass the first line, the second line employs [[nonspecific_immune_response_and_inflammatory_response | nonspecific responses]] like the [[inflammatory_response_overview | inflammatory response]] and the action of [[role_of_neutrophils_and_other_white_blood_cells | phagocytes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

Phagocytes, which include dendritic cells, macrophages, and [[role_of_neutrophils_and_other_white_blood_cells | neutrophils]], are types of [[role_of_neutrophils_and_other_white_blood_cells | white blood cells]] (leukocytes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. They engage in [[nonspecific_immune_response_and_inflammatory_response | nonspecific defense]] because they don't identify specific types of viruses, proteins, or bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Instead, they recognize general "shady" characteristics, such as the presence of [[dna_in_cells_and_the_role_of_nucleus | double-stranded DNA]] which is common in viruses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. The [[innate_immune_system_and_first_line_barriers | nonspecific immune system]] is found across many species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## The Specific (Adaptive) Immune System

The specific, or adaptive, immune system is considered a newer evolutionary adaptation, particularly developed in humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. It is based on the body's exposure to specific pathogens and develops resistance over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

The main cellular components of the specific immune system are [[role_of_neutrophils_and_other_white_blood_cells | lymphocytes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. [[role_of_neutrophils_and_other_white_blood_cells | Lymphocytes]] are a distinct type of [[role_of_neutrophils_and_other_white_blood_cells | white blood cell]] or leukocyte <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

### Types of Lymphocytes

[[role_of_neutrophils_and_other_white_blood_cells | Lymphocytes]] are primarily divided into two categories:
*   **B lymphocytes (B cells)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>
*   **T lymphocytes (T cells)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>

The "B" in B lymphocytes originates from their initial recognition in the bursa of Fabricius in birds, an organ involved in the avian immune system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. However, in humans, B lymphocytes are produced and developed in the bone marrow, making "B" easily remembered for "bone marrow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

T lymphocytes begin their development in the bone marrow but mature in the thymus, which is where they get their "T" designation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

### The Humoral Response (B Lymphocytes)

B lymphocytes are central to the [[humoral_response_and_b_lymphocytes | humoral response]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. The term "humoral" refers to the fluids of the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. This response is effective when pathogens, such as viruses or bacteria, are floating freely in the body's fluids and have not yet infiltrated cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

### The Cell-Mediated Response (T Lymphocytes)

T lymphocytes participate in the [[cellmediated_response_and_t_lymphocytes | cell-mediated response]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. This response becomes critical when pathogens, like viruses or bacteria, have infiltrated and infected the body's cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. In such cases, the infected cells are producing more pathogens, and the [[cellmediated_response_and_t_lymphocytes | cell-mediated response]] aims to eliminate these compromised cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Types of T lymphocytes include helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Helper T cells can amplify and activate the [[humoral_response_and_b_lymphocytes | humoral response]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

The [[kidney_overview_and_function | kidney]] is an organ primarily known for excreting waste, but it also helps maintain water levels, regulate salts or electrolytes, and influence blood pressure and hormone production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The smallest functional level of the [[kidney_overview_and_function | kidney]] is the nephron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Each average [[kidney_overview_and_function | kidney]] contains approximately one million nephrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## Kidney Anatomy Overview
The [[kidney_overview_and_function | kidney]] is typically located closer to the back, on either side of the spine, behind the liver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Internally, the [[kidney_overview_and_function | kidney]] is divided into two main regions:
*   **[[role_of_the_renal_cortex_and_medulla | Renal Cortex]]**: The outer part of the [[kidney_overview_and_function | kidney]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   **[[role_of_the_renal_cortex_and_medulla | Renal Medulla]]**: The inner, middle part of the [[kidney_overview_and_function | kidney]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
These regions play an important role in the [[blood_filtration_process_in_the_nephron | filtration]] and waste excretion processes performed by the nephron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## The Functional Unit: The Nephron
The nephron is considered the functional unit of the [[kidney_overview_and_function | kidney]] because it is at this level that waste excretion and the maintenance of blood water levels primarily occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. A nephron typically starts in the [[role_of_the_renal_cortex_and_medulla | renal cortex]], dips down into the [[role_of_the_renal_cortex_and_medulla | medulla]], and then returns to the [[role_of_the_renal_cortex_and_medulla | cortex]] before eventually dumping into collecting ducts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

### Initial Filtration in the Bowman's Capsule
The process begins with [[blood_filtration_process_in_the_nephron | blood flow]] entering the nephron:
1.  **Afferent Arteriole**: [[blood_filtration_process_in_the_nephron | Blood]] enters the nephron via the afferent arteriole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This is an arterial capillary system, meaning the [[blood_filtration_process_in_the_nephron | blood]] is still oxygenated and under high pressure, which is crucial for squeezing fluid out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
2.  **Glomerulus**: The afferent arteriole leads into the glomerulus, a "big windy place" where the [[blood_filtration_process_in_the_nephron | blood]] vessels are very porous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
3.  **Bowman's Capsule**: The glomerulus is surrounded by the Bowman's capsule, a sphere with an opening where the capillary winds around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
    *   **Podocytes**: Specialized [[cellular_structure_and_functions | cells]] called podocytes line the Bowman's capsule and are selective about what gets filtered out of the [[blood_filtration_process_in_the_nephron | blood]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
    *   **Bowman's Space**: Approximately one-fifth of the fluid from the [[blood_filtration_process_in_the_nephron | blood]] enters this space, forming the "filtrate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
    *   **Filtrate Composition**: The filtrate consists of easily dissolved substances like small ions (e.g., sodium), small molecules (e.g., glucose), and amino acids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Larger molecules like red [[blood_filtration_process_in_the_nephron | blood]] [[cellular_structure_and_functions | cells]] and proteins are not filtered out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
4.  **Efferent Arteriole**: The remaining [[blood_filtration_process_in_the_nephron | blood]] leaves the glomerulus via the efferent arteriole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

### Reabsorption and Concentration along the Tubule
After initial filtration, the filtrate undergoes further processing in the rest of the nephron:

#### Proximal Tubule (Proximal Convoluted Tubule)
This is the part of the nephron closest to the Bowman's capsule, characterized by its convoluted (curvy) shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Its primary function is to begin [[water_and_solute_reabsorption_in_the_nephron | reabsorbing]] essential substances that the body does not want to lose:
*   **Active Reabsorption**: Glucose, sodium, and amino acids are actively pumped back into the [[blood_filtration_process_in_the_nephron | blood]] using [[atp_synthase_function and mechanism | ATP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. This process involves [[cellular_structure_and_functions | cells]] lining the tubule, which have structures that aid in this reabsorption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.
*   **Water Reabsorption**: Some water is also [[water_and_solute_reabsorption_in_the_nephron | reabsorbed]] here, preventing the excretion of gallons of water daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

#### Loop of Henle
The loop of Henle is a significant part of the nephron that dips down into the [[role_of_the_renal_cortex_and_medulla | renal medulla]] from the [[role_of_the_renal_cortex_and_medulla | cortex]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. It is crucial for concentrating the filtrate and plays a major role in [[water_and_solute_reabsorption_in the nephron | water reabsorption]]:
*   **Ascending Limb**: This part of the loop actively pumps out salts (sodium, potassium, chlorine ions) into the surrounding [[role_of_the_renal_cortex_and_medulla | medulla]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. This process requires [[atp_synthase_function_and_mechanism | ATP]] and makes the [[role_of_the_renal_cortex_and_medulla | renal medulla]] "salty" or "hypertonic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. The ascending limb is impermeable to water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.
*   **Descending Limb**: This part is permeable only to water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. As the filtrate moves down the descending limb into the salty [[role_of_the_renal_cortex_and_medulla | medulla]], water naturally leaves the tubule through [[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | osmosis]], moving from an area of lower solute concentration (filtrate) to higher solute concentration (medulla) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. This passive water movement is a major mechanism for regaining filtered water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. The length of the loop allows ample time for this water reabsorption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

#### Distal Convoluted Tubule
After the loop of Henle, the filtrate enters the distal convoluted tubule, which is "further away" from the beginning of the nephron and is also convoluted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. Here, more reabsorption occurs, including calcium and additional sodium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. A little more water is also reabsorbed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>.

### Collecting Ducts
The processed filtrate, now more concentrated and containing mainly waste products and unneeded water, is dumped into collecting ducts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>. Multiple nephrons empty into a single collecting duct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.
*   **Medullary Passage**: The collecting duct extends back into the salty [[role_of_the_renal_cortex_and_medulla | medulla]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>.
*   **Hormonal Control**: Hormones, such as anti-diuretic hormone, can influence how porous the collecting duct [[cellular_membrane_and_its_role | membrane]] is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. If made porous, more water can leave due to the salty environment, further concentrating the filtrate (now considered urine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.
Finally, the urine leaves the [[kidney_overview_and_function | kidney]] via the ureters and travels to the urinary bladder for excretion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>.

The kidneys are organs primarily known for producing or excreting waste, but they also play crucial roles in maintaining water and electrolyte levels, regulating blood pressure, and producing hormones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Humans typically have two kidneys, located closer to the back, on either side of the spine, behind the liver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Kidney Anatomy

Internally, a kidney is composed of distinct regions:
*   **Renal Cortex** The outer part of the kidney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. The term "renal" always refers to the kidney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Renal Medulla** The inner part of the kidney, which can be thought of as its "middle" (medulla means middle) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Both the cortex and medulla play vital roles in the kidney's processes of [[filtration_in_the_kidney|filtration]] and waste excretion, as well as the regulation of water balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## The Nephron: Functional Unit of the Kidney

The smallest functional unit of the kidney is the [[the_nephron_structure|nephron]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. It is at the [[the_nephron_structure|nephron]] level that the primary functions of waste excretion and water level maintenance in the blood system occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

Each kidney contains approximately one million [[the_nephron_structure|nephrons]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. A [[the_nephron_structure|nephron]] begins in the renal cortex, dips down into the renal medulla, then returns to the cortex, and finally empties into collecting ducts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. The fluid processed by the [[the_nephron_structure|nephrons]] eventually travels through the ureters to the urinary bladder for excretion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. [[the_nephron_structure|Nephron]] tubules are extremely thin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

## Nephron Function: Filtration and Reabsorption

The process within the [[the_nephron_structure|nephron]] involves two main stages: [[filtration_in_the_kidney|filtration]] of blood and [[reabsorption_process_in_the_nephron|reabsorption]] of necessary substances.

### 1. Blood Flow and Initial Filtration

Blood enters the [[the_nephron_structure|nephron]] through the **afferent arteriole** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. It then flows into the **glomerulus**, a coiled network of capillaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. Blood leaves the glomerulus via the **efferent arteriole** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Both arterioles carry oxygenated blood, which is unusual for a capillary system exit, but beneficial here as arterial systems maintain higher blood pressure necessary for [[filtration_in_the_kidney|filtration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

The glomerulus is highly porous and surrounded by specialized cells called **podocytes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. These structures form the **Bowman's capsule**, a spherical structure that encloses the glomerulus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. The space within the Bowman's capsule is called **Bowman's space** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

Under high pressure, about one-fifth of the fluid from the blood is squeezed out of the glomerulus and into Bowman's space, forming the **filtrate** (also called glomerular filtrate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. This filtrate contains small ions (like sodium), small molecules (such as glucose and amino acids), and water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Larger components like red blood cells and large proteins are not filtered out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. This filtrate is not yet urine, as many essential substances need to be reabsorbed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

### 2. Proximal Tubule

From the Bowman's capsule, the filtrate moves into the **proximal tubule** (also known as the proximal convoluted tubule due to its curvy shape) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. The primary function of this segment is the [[reabsorption_process_in_the_nephron|reabsorption]] of valuable substances back into the bloodstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. These include glucose, sodium, amino acids, and some water, which are essential for the body and should not be lost in urine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

[[reabsorption_process_in_the_nephron|Reabsorption]] in the proximal tubule is an active process that requires ATP, primarily for pumping sodium ions out of the tubule, which then facilitates the movement of other substances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. These reabsorbed substances move from the tubule cells into nearby capillaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

### 3. [[loop_of_henle_mechanisms|Loop of Henle]]

The filtrate then enters the [[loop_of_henle_mechanisms|Loop of Henle]], a major part of the [[the_nephron_structure|nephron]]'s length that dips deep into the renal medulla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. The [[loop_of_henle_mechanisms|Loop of Henle]] has two main purposes:
*   **Making the Medulla Salty:** The **ascending part** of the [[loop_of_henle_mechanisms|Loop of Henle]] actively pumps out salts (sodium, potassium, chlorine ions) into the surrounding renal medulla, making it very salty (hypertonic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. This active pumping requires ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. The ascending part is permeable to these salts and ions, but not to water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.
*   **Water [[reabsorption_process_in_the_nephron|Reabsorption]]:** The **descending part** of the [[loop_of_henle_mechanisms|Loop of Henle]] is permeable only to water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. As the filtrate moves down this part into the salty medulla, water naturally flows out of the tubule into the hypertonic medulla via osmosis, a major mechanism for recovering water that was initially filtered out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. This passive movement of water is why the [[loop_of_henle_mechanisms|Loop of Henle]] is so long, allowing sufficient time for water to exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.

### 4. Distal Tubule

After the [[loop_of_henle_mechanisms|Loop of Henle]], the filtrate enters the **distal convoluted tubule**, which is located further away from the Bowman's capsule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. Here, more [[reabsorption_process_in_the_nephron|reabsorption]] of substances like calcium and additional sodium occurs, along with a bit more water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. By this point, most desired substances have been reabsorbed, and the fluid is primarily waste products and excess water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.

### 5. Collecting Duct

The processed filtrate then enters the **collecting ducts**, which serve as "trash chutes" for multiple [[the_nephron_structure|nephrons]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. These ducts also extend into the salty renal medulla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

The permeability of the collecting duct to water can be regulated by hormones like the anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. If the collecting duct is made more porous, more water will leave the filtrate as it passes through the salty medulla, further concentrating the urine and conserving water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>. Finally, the concentrated fluid, now called urine, leaves the kidney via the ureters and collects in the urinary bladder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>.

The body's [[innate_immune_system_and_its_components | immune system]] initiates an [[cellular_mechanisms_of_inflammation | inflammatory response]] when the body's primary defenses, such as skin or mucous membranes, are breached by pathogens like viruses or bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. This initial "field of battle" involves specific cells, including mast cells and dendritic cells, which play crucial roles in signaling and initiating the immune cascade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

## Mast Cells

Mast cells are immune cells present among skin cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. Their primary role in the [[cellular_mechanisms_of_inflammation | inflammatory response]] is to release histamine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>.

Mast cells can be activated by several stimuli:
*   Direct physical contact, such as from a piercing object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>.
*   Chemokines released by damaged cells in the vicinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>.
*   Molecules or byproducts released by invading bacteria or viruses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>.

Upon activation, mast cells release histamine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>. Histamine causes endothelial cells lining capillaries to separate, leading to vasodilation (capillary enlargement) and increased porosity of capillary walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>. This allows more fluid and immune cells, including [[role_of_phagocytes_in_the_immune_response | phagocytes]] like neutrophils, to enter the interstitial fluid at the site of infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>. The collection of fluid contributes to the swelling, redness, heat, and pain characteristic of [[cellular_mechanisms_of_inflammation | inflammation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## Dendritic Cells

Dendritic cells are a type of [[role_of_phagocytes_in_the_immune_response | phagocyte]] that tend to reside near the skin and other external interfaces of the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. While their name suggests a connection to the nervous system due to their appearance, they are distinct from neurons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.

Their key functions include:
*   **Phagocytosis**: They [[role_of_phagocytes_in_the_immune_response | phagocytose]] (engulf) particles, such as viruses and bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>.
*   **Antigen Presentation**: They are highly effective at presenting ingested particles on their surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>. This presentation is crucial for activating [[functions_of_lymphocytes_b_and_t_cells | helper T-cells]], which in turn can "ring the alarm bell" and coordinate a broader adaptive immune response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.

Both mast cells and dendritic cells are essential early responders in the body's defense against infection, with mast cells facilitating the localized [[cellular_mechanisms_of_inflammation | inflammatory response]] and dendritic cells bridging the gap between innate and adaptive immunity by activating T-cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:00">[12:35:00]</a>.

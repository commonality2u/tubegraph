[[Multiplication and division in equations | Multiplication]], often referred to as "timesing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:37">[01:37:37]</a>, is a fundamental mathematical operation. It provides a simple way to perform repeated addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:41">[01:41:41]</a>.

## Understanding Multiplication Through Repeated Addition

Consider the example of 2 times 3:
*   It can be interpreted as adding 2 to itself three times: 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:55">[01:55:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.
*   Alternatively, it can be seen as adding 3 to itself two times: 3 + 3 = 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:55">[02:55:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:15">[03:15:15]</a>.
*   Regardless of the interpretation, the result is the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:48">[03:48:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:07">[04:07:07]</a>. This demonstrates one of the useful [[Multiplication properties and concepts | properties of multiplication]], where switching the order of the numbers does not change the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:33">[07:33:33]</a>.

## Multiplication for Simplified Counting

Multiplication is especially useful for simplifying counting tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:42">[04:42:42]</a>.
Consider a collection of lemons arranged in rows:

```
🍋 🍋 🍋
🍋 🍋 🍋
🍋 🍋 🍋
🍋 🍋 🍋
```

To count the total number of lemons:
1.  **Count lemons per row**: There are 3 lemons in each row <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:06">[06:06:06]</a>.
2.  **Count the number of rows**: There are 4 rows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:16">[06:16:16]</a>.
3.  **Multiply**: The total number of lemons is 4 times 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:39">[06:39:39]</a>.

### Interpreting "Times"
*   **4 times 3** can be interpreted as "3 four times": 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:06">[07:06:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:11">[07:11:11]</a>.
*   **3 times 4** (which yields the same result) can be interpreted as "4 three times": 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:41">[07:41:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:46">[07:46:46]</a>.

The ability to arrange items into rows and columns and then multiply the number of items per row by the number of rows (or vice versa) provides an efficient way to count, especially for large quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:47">[09:47:47]</a>.

## Special [[Multiplication properties and concepts | Multiplication Properties]]

### Multiplying by 1
When any number is multiplied by 1, the result is the number itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:59">[10:59:59]</a>.
*   3 times 1 means "three 1's": 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:33">[10:33:33]</a>.
*   3 times 1 can also be thought of as "3 one time": 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:49">[10:49:49]</a>.
*   Examples:
    *   100 times 1 = 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:10">[11:10:10]</a>
    *   1 times 39 = 39 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:16">[11:16:16]</a>

### Multiplying by 0
When any number is multiplied by 0, the result is always 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:48">[12:48:48]</a>.
*   4 times 0 means "0 four times": 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:59">[11:59:59]</a>.
*   4 times 0 can also be thought of as "4 zero times", which means there are no 4s to count, resulting in nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:15">[12:15:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:40">[12:40:40]</a>.
*   Examples:
    *   5,493,692 times 0 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:50">[12:50:50]</a>
    *   0 times 17 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:07">[13:07:07]</a>

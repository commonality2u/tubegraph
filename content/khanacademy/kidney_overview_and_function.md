The kidneys are organs responsible for filtering waste from the blood, maintaining proper water and salt balance, regulating blood pressure, and producing hormones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Humans typically have two kidneys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. They are located closer to the back, on either side of the spine, behind the liver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Internal Structure

When a kidney is sliced open, its internal structure reveals distinct regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>:
*   **[[role_of_the_renal_cortex_and_medulla | Renal Cortex]]** - The outer part of the kidney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **[[role_of_the_renal_cortex_and_medulla | Renal Medulla]]** - The middle part of the kidney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. The term "renal" refers to anything related to the kidney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

These regions are significant as they play a crucial role in the filtration process and the excretion of waste while preventing excessive water loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## The [[nephron_structure_and_function | Nephron]]

The functional unit of the kidney is the [[nephron_structure_and_function | nephron]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. It is at this level that the primary kidney functions—waste excretion and the maintenance of blood water levels—occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. An average human kidney contains approximately one million [[nephron_structure_and_function | nephrons]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. While their tubules are super thin, the overall length of a [[nephron_structure_and_function | nephron]] can be significant as it dips into the renal medulla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

A [[nephron_structure_and_function | nephron]] typically starts in the renal cortex, dips down into the renal medulla, then returns to the cortex, and finally dumps its fluid into collecting ducts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. The fluid eventually flows into the ureters and then to the urinary bladder for excretion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

### [[blood_filtration_process_in_the_nephron | Blood Filtration]]

The [[blood_filtration_process_in_the_nephron | blood filtration process in the nephron]] begins with the blood flow:
1.  **Afferent Arteriole** - Blood enters the [[nephron_structure_and_function | nephron]] through the afferent arteriole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
2.  **Glomerulus** - The blood then enters the glomerulus, a highly porous and windy capillary network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Blood pressure is high here, facilitating the squeezing of fluid and dissolved substances out of the blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
3.  **Bowman's Capsule** - The glomerulus is surrounded by the Bowman's capsule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. This capsule contains specialized cells called podocytes that are selective in what gets filtered out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
4.  **Bowman's Space** - About a fifth of the fluid from the blood is filtered into the Bowman's space, located inside the Bowman's capsule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. This filtered fluid is called **filtrate** (or glomerular filtrate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
    *   **Filtered Substances** - Small ions (e.g., sodium), small molecules (e.g., glucose, amino acids) are easily dissolved in fluid and filtered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
    *   **Non-filtered Substances** - Larger molecules like red blood cells and larger proteins are not filtered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
5.  **Efferent Arteriole** - The remaining blood leaves the glomerulus via the efferent arteriole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Unlike typical capillaries, it remains an arterial system, which helps maintain higher blood pressure for efficient filtration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

### [[water_and_solute_reabsorption_in_the_nephron | Reabsorption in the Nephron]]

After filtration, the filtrate moves through different parts of the [[nephron_structure_and_function | nephron]] where essential substances and water are reabsorbed back into the blood.

#### Proximal Tubule
The filtrate first enters the proximal tubule, which is convoluted (curvy) and near the beginning of the [[nephron_structure_and_function | nephron]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. The main purpose of this segment is to reabsorb substances the body doesn't want to lose, such as glucose, sodium, and amino acids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. This reabsorption is an active process that uses ATP (energy) to pump substances, particularly sodium, back into the bloodstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. Some water is also reabsorbed here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

#### Loop of Henle
Following the proximal tubule, the filtrate enters the loop of Henle, which dips down into the renal medulla and then ascends back towards the cortex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. The loop of Henle has two main parts:
*   **Ascending Part** - Actively pumps out salts (sodium, potassium, chlorine ions) into the surrounding renal medulla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. This process requires ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. This part is permeable to salts but not to water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. The active pumping of salts makes the renal medulla very salty, or hypertonic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.
*   **Descending Part** - This part is only permeable to water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. As the filtrate descends into the salty medulla, water naturally leaves the tubule via osmosis, moving from an area of lower solute concentration inside the tubule to an area of higher solute concentration (the salty medulla) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. This is a major mechanism for reabsorbing a large amount of water that was initially filtered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. The length of the loop of Henle allows sufficient time for this water reabsorption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

#### Distal Tubule
After the loop of Henle, the filtrate enters the distal convoluted tubule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. Here, more reabsorption occurs, including calcium and additional sodium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>. A little more water is also reabsorbed at this stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>.

#### Collecting Ducts
Finally, the processed filtrate, which is now more concentrated with waste products, is dumped into collecting ducts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. Multiple [[nephron_structure_and_function | nephrons]] drain into a single collecting duct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. The collecting duct extends back into the salty renal medulla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. Hormones, such as antidiuretic hormone, can influence the porosity of the collecting duct, allowing more water to leave if needed, further concentrating the urine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. The concentrated urine then leaves the kidney via the ureters and travels to the urinary bladder for storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>.

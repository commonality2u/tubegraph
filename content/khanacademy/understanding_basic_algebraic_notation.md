[[introduction_to_algebra | Algebra]] involves understanding what equations and expressions actually mean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. It's crucial to understand how to manipulate equations and what they represent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Algebraic Multiplication

In [[understanding_arithmetic_and_expressions | algebra]], when a number is written next to a variable, it signifies multiplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. For example, `7x` literally means "7 times x" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This is a shorthand notation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

Traditional multiplication signs are generally avoided in [[introduction_to_algebra | algebra]] because the symbol `x` is the most common variable used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Using `x` for multiplication could lead to confusion (e.g., `xx` or `times times`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. While a dot (`·`) can represent multiplication (e.g., `7 · x = 14`), simply writing the number next to the variable (e.g., `7x`) is standard for a coefficient multiplying a variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

### Visualizing Multiplication

The expression `7x` can be visualized as `x` added to itself seven times: `x + x + x + x + x + x + x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

## Solving Basic Algebraic Equations

Solving equations systematically is important, especially as they become more complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

### The Principle of Equality

An equation states that one side is equal to the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. To maintain this equality, any operation performed on one side of the equation must also be performed on the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

### Using Division to Solve Equations

When an equation is in the form of a coefficient multiplied by a variable equaling some other value (e.g., `7x = 14`), the goal is to isolate the variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

To do this, divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

For example, to solve `7x = 14`:
1.  Divide the left side by 7: `7x / 7 = x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
2.  Divide the right side by 7: `14 / 7 = 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
3.  This results in `x = 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

Visually, if `7x` represents seven equal portions of `x` and these are equal to 14 objects, dividing both sides by 7 means distributing the 14 objects into seven equal groups, showing that each `x` corresponds to two objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

Dividing both sides by 3 is equivalent to multiplying both sides by 1/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. For instance, in `3x = 15`:
*   Dividing by 3: `(3x)/3 = 15/3` leads to `x = 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
*   Multiplying by 1/3: `(1/3) * 3x = (1/3) * 15` leads to `1x = 5`, which simplifies to `x = 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

### Combining Like Terms

When an equation has multiple terms with the same variable, these terms can be combined or [[simplifying_expressions | simplified]]. For example, `2y + 4y = 18` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   `2y` means `y + y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   `4y` means `y + y + y + y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
*   Combining them results in `(y + y) + (y + y + y + y)`, which is a total of six `y`'s, or `6y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
*   So, the equation simplifies to `6y = 18` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.
*   Then, divide both sides by 6: `(6y)/6 = 18/6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
*   This gives `y = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

### Checking Solutions

It's always possible to check if the solution to an equation is correct by substituting the found value back into the original equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
For `2y + 4y = 18` with `y = 3`:
`2 * 3 + 4 * 3 = 6 + 12 = 18` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
Since `18 = 18`, the solution is correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

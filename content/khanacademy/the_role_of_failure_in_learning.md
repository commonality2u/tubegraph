Learning is an inherent human quality, and it begins from a foundational state where "nobody's born smart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>; "we all start at zero" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Initially, individuals are unable to perform basic tasks like talking or walking, let alone complex ones such as algebra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The principle holds true across all disciplines and for everyone: "nobody's good at anything at first" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Even historical figures like Einstein once couldn't count to ten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, and Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Failure as a Component of Growth

[[The process of learning and growth | The process of learning and growth]] is characterized by initial struggles, mistakes, and persistent effort. While it can be "frustrating" and "confusing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, individuals are "born to learn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, embracing [[the universality of learning | the universality of learning]]. This journey involves stumbling, slipping, crawling, falling, and failing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The progression from "struggling until one day they walk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a> illustrates that progress is built "one foot in front of the other" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a> and "one idea on top of the next" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

Crucially, "each wrong answer" contributes to making the brain "a little bit stronger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This perspective reframes the experience of failure, asserting that "failing is just another word for growing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The continuous effort, marked by the phrase "and you keep going" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>, is fundamental to learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Confidence in Learning Potential

A core aspect of this learning journey is developing [[confidence in learning potential | confidence in learning potential]]. This means "knowing that you'll get it even if you haven't gotten it yet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The belief stems from the understanding that "the most beautiful complex concepts in the whole universe are built on basic ideas that anyone anywhere can understand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Therefore, regardless of who or where an individual is, the fundamental truth is clear: "you can learn anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

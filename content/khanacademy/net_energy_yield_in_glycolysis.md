[[overview_of_glycolysis | Glycolysis]] is the first of roughly three phases in cellular respiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The term "glycolysis" literally means the breaking down of [[role_of_glucose_in_energy_production | glucose]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. This process can occur with or without oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. If oxygen is present, [[glycolysis process and phases | glycolysis]] proceeds to the Krebs cycle and then the electron transport chain, where the bulk of [[ATP production in glycolysis | ATP production]] occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. Without oxygen, the process leads to fermentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.

[[glycolysis process and its role in breaking down glucose | Glycolysis]] starts with [[role_of_glucose_in_energy_production | glucose]], which has the formula C6H12O6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. The process primarily focuses on the carbon backbone, breaking down the six-carbon glucose molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.

## [[Glycolysis process and phases | Phases of Glycolysis]]

[[Steps and reactions in glycolysis | Glycolysis]] is divided into two main phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>:

### Investment Phase
The investment phase initiates [[glycolysis process and its role in breaking down glucose | glycolysis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. In this phase, two [[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | ATP]] molecules are consumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>. The purpose of this initial [[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | ATP]] usage is to break down the glucose molecule into two 3-carbon compounds, known as PGAL (phosphoglyceraldehyde) or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. These 3-carbon compounds receive phosphate groups from the utilized [[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | ATP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.

### Payoff Phase
After the investment phase, each of the two PGAL molecules proceeds into the payoff phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. In this phase, each PGAL molecule is converted into pyruvate (also known as pyruvic acid), which is another 3-carbon compound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. This means that for every molecule of glucose, two molecules of pyruvate are produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>.

During the payoff phase, for each PGAL molecule transformed into pyruvate:
*   Two [[ATP production in glycolysis | ATP]] molecules are produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>.
*   One [[role_of_nad_in_glycolysis | NADH]] molecule is produced from [[role_of_nad_in_glycolysis | NAD]]+ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>. The [[role_of_nad_in_glycolysis | NAD]]+ is reduced by gaining a hydrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.

## Net Energy Yield

Let's summarize the overall inputs and outputs for one molecule of glucose:

### Inputs
*   One [[role_of_glucose_in_energy_production | glucose]] molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>
*   Two [[role_of_nad_in_glycolysis | NAD]]+ molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>
*   Two [[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | ATP]] molecules (used in the investment phase) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>
*   Four ADP molecules (converted to [[ATP production in glycolysis | ATP]] in the payoff phase) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>
*   Four inorganic phosphate groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>

### Outputs
*   Two pyruvate molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>
*   Two [[role_of_nad_in_glycolysis | NADH]] molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>
*   Two ADP molecules (resulting from the initial [[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | ATP]] consumption) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>
*   Four [[ATP production in glycolysis | ATP]] molecules (from the payoff phase) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>

Therefore, the [[ATP production in glycolysis | net ATP]] yield from [[glycolysis process and its role in breaking down glucose | glycolysis]] is calculated as:
4 [[ATP production in glycolysis | ATP]] (produced) - 2 [[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | ATP]] (invested) = **2 net [[ATP production in glycolysis | ATP]] molecules** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:14:00">[13:14:00]</a>.

In addition to the net [[ATP production in glycolysis | ATP]], [[glycolysis process and its role in breaking down glucose | glycolysis]] also yields **two [[role_of_nad_in_glycolysis | NADH]] molecules** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>. These [[role_of_nad_in_glycolysis | NADH]] molecules are significant because they can later be used in the electron transport chain to produce additional [[ATP production in glycolysis | ATP]] (approximately three [[ATP production in glycolysis | ATPs]] per [[role_of_nad_in_glycolysis | NADH]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">[12:22:00]</a>. The pyruvate molecules produced are then re-engineered into acetyl-CoAs, serving as raw materials for the Krebs cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59:00">[08:59:00]</a>.

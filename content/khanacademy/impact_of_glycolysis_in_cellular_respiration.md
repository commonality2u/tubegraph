[[overview_of_glycolysis | Glycolysis]] is a fundamental biochemical pathway found in virtually all known life forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Its primary function is to break down glucose, a six-carbon molecule, into two molecules of pyruvate, each containing three carbons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This process marks the initial stage of [[overview_of_cellular_respiration | cellular respiration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

## Key Outputs of [[overview_of_glycolysis | Glycolysis]]

The [[overview_of_glycolysis | glycolysis]] pathway yields two main products that are crucial for subsequent energy production:

### [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATP Production]]
[[glycolysis_and_its_role_in_cellular_respiration | Glycolysis]] directly produces a net of two [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]] molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This is achieved through an "investment phase" and a "payoff phase" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

*   **Investment Phase**
    Two [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]] molecules are consumed during the initial steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. For instance, an [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]] is used to phosphorylate glucose into glucose-6-phosphate, a reaction facilitated by hexokinase and a magnesium ion cofactor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Another [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]] is used by phosphofructokinase to add a second phosphate group, forming fructose-1,6-bisphosphate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
*   **Payoff Phase**
    Four [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]] molecules are produced in the later steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This includes two [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]]s produced when phosphoglycerate kinase removes a phosphate group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>, and another two [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]]s from pyruvate kinase when it dephosphorylates a molecule to pyruvate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

### [[role_of_nad_and_nadh_in_glycolysis | NAD Reduction]]
The pathway also involves the reduction of two NAD+ molecules to two NADH molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.
*   **NAD+ to NADH**
    NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) gains electrons and a hydrogen atom (effectively a hydride anion) to become NADH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This specific reduction occurs through a dehydrogenase enzyme, which also adds a phosphate group to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   **Future [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]] Potential**
    The NADH molecules can be further oxidized in the electron transport chain, a part of oxidative phosphorylation, to generate even more [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

## Role in [[overview_of_cellular_respiration | Cellular Respiration]] Pathways

[[glycolysis_and_its_role_in_cellular_respiration | Glycolysis]] serves as the initial step for both [[anaerobic_vs_aerobic_processes_in_cellular_respiration | aerobic]] and [[anaerobic_vs_aerobic_processes_in_cellular_respiration | anaerobic]] respiration.

*   **[[anaerobic_vs_aerobic_processes_in_cellular_respiration | Aerobic Respiration]] (with oxygen)**
    If oxygen is present, the pyruvate and NADH products from [[glycolysis_and_its_role_in_cellular_respiration | glycolysis]] move into the mitochondria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Here, they proceed through the Citric Acid Cycle (Krebs Cycle) and oxidative phosphorylation, leading to a much larger yield of [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **[[anaerobic_vs_aerobic_processes_in_cellular_respiration | Anaerobic Respiration]] (without oxygen)**
    In the absence of oxygen, cells undergo [[anaerobic_vs_aerobic_processes_in_cellular_respiration | anaerobic respiration]] or fermentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. This pathway focuses on processing the products of [[glycolysis_and_its_role_in_cellular_respiration | glycolysis]], particularly regenerating NAD+ from NADH to allow [[glycolysis_and_its_role_in_cellular_respiration | glycolysis]] to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

## [[functional_steps_and_enzymes_involved_in_glycolysis | Functional Steps and Enzymes Involved in Glycolysis]]

The entire process of [[glycolysis_and_its_role_in_cellular_respiration | glycolysis]] involves a series of complex, enzyme-catalyzed reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

### Investment Phase
This phase consumes [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]] to prepare glucose for cleavage.
1.  **Phosphorylation of Glucose**: Glucose (a six-carbon molecule) is phosphorylated at its 6th carbon by **hexokinase** to form glucose-6-phosphate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. This step uses one [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a> and is strongly directional, moving from left to right due to coupled reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Kinases are enzymes that facilitate phosphorylation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Hexokinase, like other kinases, uses a magnesium ion as a co-factor to lower activation energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
2.  **Isomerization**: Glucose-6-phosphate is converted into its isomer, fructose-6-phosphate, by **phosphoglucose isomerase** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Isomerases help convert one isomer of a molecule to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
3.  **Second Phosphorylation**: Fructose-6-phosphate is phosphorylated by **phosphofructokinase** to yield fructose-1,6-bisphosphate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. This step also consumes one [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. It's a strong forward reaction also facilitated by a magnesium co-factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
4.  **Cleavage**: Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is then broken down into two three-carbon molecules: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate, by the enzyme **fructose bisphosphate aldolase** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Aldolase enzymes facilitate aldol reactions, which can involve breaking or merging molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
5.  **Isomerization of Products**: Dihydroxyacetone phosphate can be reversibly converted into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate by **triose phosphate isomerase** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. This ensures that two molecules of G3P proceed to the payoff phase for every glucose molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

### Payoff Phase
This phase generates [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]] and NADH. All subsequent reactions happen twice for every initial glucose molecule.
1.  **Oxidation and Phosphorylation**: Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate is oxidized, and an inorganic phosphate group is added, forming 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. This reaction is catalyzed by **glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a> and involves the [[nad_reduction_to_nadh_during_glycolysis | reduction of NAD+ to NADH]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
2.  **First [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]] Generation**: The high-energy phosphate group from 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate is transferred to ADP, producing [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]] and 3-phosphoglycerate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. This step is catalyzed by **phosphoglycerate kinase**. Since there are two 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate molecules, two [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]]s are generated here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
3.  **Phosphate Group Relocation**: 3-phosphoglycerate is converted to 2-phosphoglycerate by **phosphoglycerate mutase** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. Mutases are a class of isomerases that relocate functional groups within a molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
4.  **Dehydration**: 2-phosphoglycerate is dehydrated to phosphoenolpyruvate by **enolase** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
5.  **Second [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]] Generation**: The high-energy phosphate group from phosphoenolpyruvate is transferred to ADP, generating [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]] and forming pyruvate (or pyruvic acid) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. This final step is catalyzed by **pyruvate kinase**. As this also occurs twice, another two [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]]s are produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

The entire process of [[glycolysis_and_its_role_in_cellular_respiration | glycolysis]] is constantly occurring in cells, providing essential energy for bodily functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

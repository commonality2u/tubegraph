In statistics, the [[identifying_mode | mode]] is one of several measures used to describe the "average" or [[mean_median_and_mode | central tendency]] of a dataset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. It is generally considered the least frequently used of these measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a> and is often forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. Despite potentially sounding complex, the [[identifying_mode | mode]] is a very straightforward and, in some ways, the most basic idea among measures of central tendency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

## Definition of Mode

> [!definition] Mode
> The [[identifying_mode | mode]] is defined as the most common number in a given data set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. If all numbers in the dataset appear with equal frequency, and there isn't a single most common number, then the data set has no [[identifying_mode | mode]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

## How to Find the Mode

To find the [[identifying_mode | mode]] in a dataset, you identify the number that appears most frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

### Example
Consider the following dataset representing plant heights in inches: 4, 3, 1, 6, 1, 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

Let's examine the frequency of each number:
*   4 appears once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>
*   3 appears once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>
*   1 appears twice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>
*   6 appears once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>
*   7 appears once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>

The number that shows up the most times is 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Therefore, the [[identifying_mode | mode]] of this dataset is 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

## Purpose of the Mode

The [[identifying_mode | mode]] is one of several different ways to measure central tendency, aiming to find a typical, middle, or central value for a dataset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. While the [[understanding_mean | arithmetic mean]] is frequently used, and the [[mean_median_and_mode | median]] is effective when there are extreme values (outliers) that could skew the [[understanding_mean | arithmetic mean]], the [[identifying_mode | mode]] can also be useful in such situations, especially when one number appears significantly more frequently than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Each measure of central tendency serves different purposes depending on the nature of the data and the insights desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

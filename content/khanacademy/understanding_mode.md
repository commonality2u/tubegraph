The [[mode|mode]] is a measure of central tendency used to describe a set of numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It is distinct from the [[mean_median_and_mode|mean]] and [[mean_median_and_mode|median]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## Definition
The [[mode|mode]] is defined as the number that appears most frequently in a given data set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## Finding the Mode
To find the [[mode|mode]], you examine the data set and identify which number occurs more times than any other number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

### Example
Consider the following set of numbers: 23, 29, 20, 32, 23, 21, 33, 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

1.  List the numbers: 23, 29, 20, 32, 23, 21, 33, 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
2.  Count the occurrences of each number:
    *   20 appears once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>
    *   21 appears once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>
    *   23 appears twice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>
    *   25 appears once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>
    *   29 appears once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>
    *   32 appears once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>
    *   33 appears once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>

Since 23 shows up twice, and every other number shows up only once, 23 is the [[mode|mode]] for this data set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

The [[mode|mode]] is one of several ways to represent the "middle" or central tendency of a data set using a single number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

This article provides a high-level [[comparison_of_mitosis_and_meiosis | comparison of mitosis and meiosis]], focusing on their differing genetic outcomes.

## Mitosis

[[Process and phases of mitosis | Mitosis]] begins with a single cell that possesses a diploid number of chromosomes (2n) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. For human beings, this diploid number is 46 chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. After the process of [[process_and_phases_of_mitosis | mitosis]] and cytokinesis, the result is two cells, each containing the same genetic information as the original cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. These resulting cells also have the diploid number of chromosomes (2n) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

The cells produced through [[process_and_phases_of_mitosis | mitosis]] are capable of re-entering interphase, replicating their DNA, and undergoing [[process_and_phases_of_mitosis | mitosis]] again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This cyclical nature is fundamental to how most cells in the body grow and how a single-celled organism develops into a complex one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. These are primarily somatic cells, which constitute the bulk of the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

## Meiosis

[[Process and phases of meiosis | Meiosis]] also starts with a cell that has a diploid number of chromosomes (2n) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, and its DNA replicates during interphase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. However, [[process_and_phases_of_meiosis | meiosis]] proceeds in two main [[phases_of_meiosis | phases]]:

1.  **Meiosis One**: In [[detailed_cell_division_process_in_meiosis | Meiosis One]], the cell divides to produce two cells, each now possessing a haploid number of chromosomes (n) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. For humans, this means going from 46 chromosomes to 23 chromosomes in each nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. This reduction in chromosome number occurs because homologous pairs are split <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>, and they split randomly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. Importantly, the two resulting cells do not necessarily have the exact same genetic information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
2.  **Meiosis Two**: Each of the two cells from [[detailed_cell_division_process_in_meiosis | Meiosis One]] then undergoes [[detailed_cell_division_process_in_meiosis | Meiosis Two]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. This phase is similar to [[process_and_phases_of_mitosis | mitosis]] but starts with cells already having a haploid number of chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. The final outcome of [[detailed_cell_division_process_in_meiosis | meiosis]] is four cells, each containing the haploid number of chromosomes (n) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

The cells produced by [[process_and_phases_of_meiosis | meiosis]] are called gametes, or sex cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. These include sperm cells in males and egg cells in females <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Unlike [[process_and_phases_of_mitosis | mitosis]], [[process_and_phases_of_meiosis | meiosis]] is not a cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. These gametes are used for fertilization in [[role_of_meiosis_in_sexual_reproduction | sexual reproduction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. When two gametes fuse, they form a fertilized egg that can then undergo [[process_and_phases_of_mitosis | mitosis]] to create a new organism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. [[Process and phases of meiosis | Meiosis]] occurs in germ cells, found in the testes in males and ovaries in females <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## Key Differences in Genetic Outcome

The fundamental [[differences_between_mitosis_and_meiosis | differences between mitosis and meiosis]] in terms of genetic outcome are:

*   **Number of Cells**: [[Process and phases of mitosis | Mitosis]] results in two daughter cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, whereas [[process_and_phases_of_meiosis | meiosis]] results in four cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **Ploidy Level**: In [[process_and_phases_of_mitosis | mitosis]], diploid (2n) cells produce diploid (2n) daughter cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. In [[process and phases of meiosis | meiosis]], diploid (2n) cells produce haploid (n) gametes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **Genetic Identity**: Cells produced by [[process_and_phases_of_mitosis | mitosis]] are genetically identical to the original parent cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Cells produced by [[process and phases of meiosis | meiosis]] are not necessarily genetically identical to the original cell or to each other, due to the random splitting of homologous pairs during [[detailed_cell_division_process_in_meiosis | Meiosis One]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. (Note: The transcript alludes to [[genetic_variation_through_crossing_over | genetic variation]] through the random assortment of homologous chromosomes but does not explicitly detail crossing over.)
*   **Purpose**: [[Process and phases of mitosis | Mitosis]] is primarily for growth and repair, forming somatic cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. [[Process and phases of meiosis | Meiosis]] is for [[role_of_meiosis_in_sexual_reproduction | sexual reproduction]], producing gametes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Cyclical Nature**: [[Process and phases of mitosis | Mitosis]] is a cycle where daughter cells can re-enter the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. [[Process and phases of meiosis | Meiosis]] is not a cycle; its end products (gametes) are used for fertilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

In summary, the distinct genetic outcomes of [[differences_between_mitosis_and_meiosis | mitosis and meiosis]] reflect their different biological roles in [[role_of_mitosis_and_meiosis_in_human_development_and_reproduction | human development and reproduction]].

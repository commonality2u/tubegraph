The [[relation_between_work_and_energy|concepts of work and energy]] are fundamental in physics, though their everyday meanings might differ slightly from their scientific definitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. While the definitions can seem circular, understanding their mathematical representations provides a more intuitive grasp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Definition of Work

In physics, [[relation_between_work_and_energy|work]] is defined as [[definition_of_energy|energy]] transferred by a force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This definition, sourced from Wikipedia, offers a relatively intuitive understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Conversely, [[definition_of_energy|energy]] is defined as the ability to do [[relation_between_work_and_energy|work]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. This establishes a [[relation_between_work_and_energy|relationship]] where the two concepts define each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### Mathematical Representation

The [[mathematical_representation_of_work|definition of work in mechanics]] is expressed quantitatively as:

`Work = Force × Distance` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>

For example, if a force of 10 Newtons is applied to move a block 7 meters, the work done is:

`Work = 10 Newtons × 7 meters = 70 Newton meters` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>

### Units of Work and Energy

The unit for [[relation_between_work_and_energy|work]] is the Newton meter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This unit is also defined as one Joule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The Joule is the standard unit for both [[relation_between_work_and_energy|work]] and [[definition_of_energy|energy]], signifying their interconvertibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

## Work and Kinetic Energy

When a force is applied to an object, it causes acceleration (since Force = mass × acceleration) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, leading to a change in the object's velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. The work done on an object can be directly related to its change in velocity and, consequently, its [[calculating_kinetic_energy|kinetic energy]].

Consider a block of mass 'm' at rest, with a force 'F' applied over a [[concept_of_distance_and_displacement|distance]] 'd' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. The work done is `Work = F × d` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

To determine the final velocity ('vf') of the block, kinematics equations can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. A relevant kinematic equation is:

`vf² = vi² + 2ad` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>

Where:
*   `vf` is the final velocity
*   `vi` is the initial velocity
*   `a` is acceleration
*   `d` is [[concept_of_distance_and_displacement|distance]]

If the block starts at rest (`vi = 0`), the equation simplifies to:

`vf² = 2ad` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>

Knowing that `a = F/m` (from F=ma) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>, we can substitute 'a':

`vf² = 2 * (F/m) * d` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>

Rearranging the equation to isolate the work term (`F × d`):

`vf² = (2 * (F * d)) / m` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>
`m * vf² = 2 * (F * d)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>

Since `Work = F × d` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>, we can substitute 'Work' into the equation:

`m * vf² = 2 * Work` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>

Finally, solving for Work:

`Work = (1/2) * m * vf²` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>

This derived formula is the definition of [[calculating_kinetic_energy|kinetic energy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. [[calculating_kinetic_energy|Kinetic energy]] represents the [[definition_of_energy|energy]] an object possesses due to its motion, or equivalently, the [[relation_between_work_and_energy|work]] needed to accelerate an object from rest to its current velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. It is a very common and essential formula in physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

In future discussions, other forms of [[definition_of_energy|energy]] and the [[relation_between_work_and_energy|law of conservation of energy]] will be explored, highlighting how [[definition_of_energy|energy]] can be transformed from one form to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

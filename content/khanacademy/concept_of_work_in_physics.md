The concepts of work and [[definition_and_understanding_of_energy | energy]] are fundamental in physics, though they may have different meanings than in everyday life, they are not entirely unrelated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Defining Work

In common usage, "work" often refers to doing something or making a living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. In physics, however, the definitions of work and [[definition_and_understanding_of_energy | energy]] can be somewhat circular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

Work is defined as [[definition_and_understanding_of_energy | energy]] transferred by a force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This definition helps provide an intuitive understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### The Circular Definition with Energy

A challenge arises when defining work and [[definition_and_understanding_of_energy | energy]] purely with words:
*   Work is [[definition_and_understanding_of_energy | energy]] transferred by a force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   [[definition_and_understanding_of_energy | Energy]] is defined as the ability to do work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

This makes the definitions appear somewhat circular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, but understanding their quantitative relationships through equations can provide a clearer intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## Calculating Work

In mechanics, the definition of work is quantitative:
Work (W) = Force (F) × Distance (d) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### Units of Work
The units for work are Newton-meters (Nm) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. One Newton-meter is also defined as one Joule (J) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The Joule is the standard unit of work and also the unit of [[definition_and_understanding_of_energy | energy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

### Example Calculation
If a force of 10 Newtons (N) is applied to a block and moves it 7 meters (m) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, the work done on the block, or the [[definition_and_understanding_of_energy | energy]] transferred to it, is:
W = 10 N × 7 m = 70 Newton-meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
Therefore, the work done is 70 Joules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## Work and Kinetic Energy

When a constant force is applied to an object over a distance on a frictionless surface, it causes the object to accelerate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. This acceleration means the object will gain velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

### Derivation of Kinetic Energy

Consider a block of mass 'm' starting at rest, to which a force 'F' is applied over a distance 'd' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. The work done is W = F × d <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

Using kinematics equations:
1.  The final velocity squared ($v_f^2$) is equal to the initial velocity squared ($v_i^2$) plus 2 times acceleration (a) times distance (d) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>:
    $v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2ad$
2.  Since the block starts at rest, $v_i = 0$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. So, the equation simplifies to:
    $v_f^2 = 2ad$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>
3.  From Newton's second law, Force (F) = mass (m) × acceleration (a), so acceleration (a) = F/m <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
4.  Substitute 'a' into the equation:
    $v_f^2 = 2(F/m)d$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>
5.  Rearranging the terms:
    $v_f^2 = (2Fd)/m$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>
6.  Since work (W) = F × d <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>:
    $v_f^2 = (2W)/m$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>
7.  Multiplying both sides by 'm' and rearranging to solve for Work:
    $m v_f^2 = 2W$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>
    $W = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a> (where $v$ is the final velocity)

### [[kinetic_energy_formula | Kinetic Energy]] Definition and Formula

This derived formula, $W = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$, represents the work imputed into an object to get it to a certain velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. This is, by definition, [[kinetic_energy_formula | kinetic energy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

[[kinetic_energy_formula | Kinetic energy]] is the [[definition_and_understanding_of_energy | energy]] an object possesses due to its motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. It is also described as the work needed to accelerate an object from being stationary to its current velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

The formula for [[kinetic_energy_formula | kinetic energy]] (KE) is:
$KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>
The unit for [[kinetic_energy_formula | kinetic energy]] is also Joules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

This understanding of work and [[definition_and_understanding_of_energy | energy]], particularly [[kinetic_energy_formula | kinetic energy]], lays the groundwork for exploring other forms of [[definition_and_understanding_of_energy | energy]] and the [[law_of_conservation_of_energy | law of conservation of energy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. The [[law_of_conservation_of_energy | law of conservation of energy]] is crucial because it allows for tracking how one form of [[definition_and_understanding_of_energy | energy]] converts into another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

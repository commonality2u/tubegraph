The study of [[introduction_to_economics | economics]] is an attempt to understand how individuals and societies make decisions about the allocation of [[scarce_resources_and_economic_decision_making | scarce resources]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. This field traces its modern roots back to the Scottish philosopher Adam Smith, often considered the first true economist in the contemporary sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

## The Invisible Hand

In his 1776 work, *The Wealth of Nations*, Adam Smith introduced the concept of the "invisible hand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>. This idea suggests that when individual economic actors pursue their own self-interest, they often unintentionally promote the public interest more effectively than if they had explicitly intended to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. This principle is fundamental to capitalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a> and suggests that self-interested actions can frequently lead to greater innovation, investment, productivity, and overall wealth for society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. While Smith acknowledged that self-interest is not always beneficial, he argued that it "frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

Smith's initial statements blended what modern [[introduction_to_economics | economists]] now distinguish as [[microeconomics_and_macroeconomics | microeconomic]] and [[microeconomics_and_macroeconomics | macroeconomic]] concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.

## Branches of Economics

Modern [[introduction_to_economics | economics]] is typically divided into two main branches:

*   **[[microeconomics_and_macroeconomics | Microeconomics]]**: This is the study of individual economic actors, such as firms, people, or households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. It focuses on how these actors make decisions or allocations of [[scarce_resources_and_economic_decision_making | scarce resources]] and how these decisions affect prices and markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>. A [[scarce_resources_and_economic_decision_making | scarce resource]] is defined as something that is not available in infinite supply, like food, water, money, time, or labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.
*   **[[microeconomics_and_macroeconomics | Macroeconomics]]**: This branch studies the economy in aggregate, focusing on what happens at a larger scale due to the interactions of millions of individual actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. [[microeconomics_and_macroeconomics | Macroeconomics]] often addresses policy-related questions, such as the effects of raising or lowering taxes, or the impact of regulation or deregulation on overall productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>.

## The Role of Mathematical Models in Economics

In modern [[introduction_to_economics | economics]], particularly in both [[microeconomics_and_macroeconomics | microeconomics]] and [[microeconomics_and_macroeconomics | macroeconomics]], there is a strong emphasis on making the field rigorous and mathematical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.

### Benefits of Mathematical Models

Mathematical models in [[introduction_to_economics | economics]] typically begin with [[philosophical_perspectives_on_mathematics_and_algebra | philosophical]] or logical ideas about how people think and make decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>. These ideas are then simplified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>, often by making assumptions like "all people are rational" or "all people will maximize their gain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>. This simplification allows [[introduction_to_economics | economists]] to:
*   Clarify their thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>.
*   Prove things based on their stated assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>.
*   Visualize economic concepts mathematically using charts and graphs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>.

### Limitations and Dangers of Mathematical Models

Despite their value, mathematical models in [[introduction_to_economics | economics]] come with significant dangers and limitations:
*   **Oversimplification**: Models often rely on "huge simplifications" that may not accurately reflect the complexities of human behavior, as individuals are motivated by more than just self-interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>.
*   **Misleading Conclusions**: The rigor of mathematics can lead to very strong conclusions that appear proven, similar to proofs in physics. However, these conclusions are only as strong as the underlying assumptions, which may be wrong, oversimplified, or irrelevant to the specific context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>.
*   **Complexity in Aggregate**: [[microeconomics_and_macroeconomics | Macroeconomics]], in particular, is "more guilty" of oversimplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>. It attempts to model the aggregate behavior of millions of "infinitely complicated people" with fundamentally unpredictable interactions, making it extremely complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>.

It is crucial to take these models and their conclusions "with a grain of salt," always remembering that they are based on simplifying assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>. The most important thing to gain from studying [[introduction_to_economics | economics]] is the "true intuition" to reason through what is likely to happen, even without the mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>.

## Perspectives on Economists and Models

Two notable quotes highlight the challenges and perceptions surrounding [[introduction_to_economics | economics]] and its mathematical approach:

> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a> An economist is a man who states the obvious in terms of the incomprehensible.
>
> — Alfred Knopf, Publisher

This quote suggests that [[introduction_to_economics | economics]] often takes common-sense ideas and presents them using complex, "mathy" language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>. It underscores the importance of maintaining intuition and recognizing when mathematical models might deviate from common sense due to oversimplifications or wrong assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>.

> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a> An economist is an expert who will know tomorrow why the things he predicted yesterday didn't happen today.
>
> — Lawrence J. Peter, Professor

This observation is particularly relevant to [[microeconomics_and_macroeconomics | macroeconomics]], where predictions about economic growth, inflation, or recessions are common but frequently prove to be inaccurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>. This highlights that, despite its mathematical rigor, [[introduction_to_economics | economics]] is not a "science like physics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>. It remains open to subjectivity, especially in the choice of assumptions underlying its models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:00">[09:46:00]</a>.

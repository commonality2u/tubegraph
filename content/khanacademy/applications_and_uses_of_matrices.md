A [[introduction_to_matrices | matrix]] is fundamentally a data representation, serving as a way of writing down data in a table of numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45">[03:45]</a>. It is not a natural phenomenon, but rather a human-defined convention used to represent a mathematical concept or a set of values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27">[04:27]</a>. The specific meaning of a [[introduction_to_matrices | matrix]] must be defined by its user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37">[04:37]</a>.

## Representing Phenomena
Matrices are versatile and can represent a wide range of phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54">[03:54]</a>. The power of matrices lies in their ability to organize data in a structured format, enabling various mathematical operations to be performed on them.

## Specific Applications

### Linear Equations
In [[applying_arithmetic_to_algebra | Algebra I]] or [[applying_arithmetic_to_algebra | Algebra II]] classes, matrices are commonly used to represent [[visualization_techniques_in_solving_equations | linear equations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59">[03:59]</a>. This application provides a systematic way to solve systems of linear equations.

### Computer Graphics
Matrices are extensively used in computer graphics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13">[04:13]</a>. In this domain, the elements within a [[introduction_to_matrices | matrix]] can represent:
*   Pixels on a screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16">[04:16]</a>
*   Points in coordinate space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18">[04:18]</a>

### Other Potential Uses
The applications of matrices extend far beyond these examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22">[04:22]</a>. While the initial focus might be on the conventions of [[adding_and_subtracting_matrices | adding]], multiplying, or inverting matrices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01">[05:01]</a>, understanding the underlying intuition and what these operations represent is crucial for applying them effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17">[05:17]</a>.

Despite a significant recent donation, Khan Academy emphasizes its ongoing need for financial support to achieve its global educational aspirations.

## Ongoing Need for Donations
While expressing gratitude for a generous $5 million donation from [[elon_musks_donation_to_khan_academy | Elon Musk]] and the Musk Foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, Sal Khan of Khan Academy highlighted that the organization continues to run at a deficit for 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. Therefore, every donation, regardless of size, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

## Impact of Contributions
The donation will significantly accelerate the development of content across all subjects from K through early college, including science content and early learning materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. It will also enhance the software and practice exercises to be more engaging for millions of students and teachers worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

Khan Academy boasts 120 million registered users, with 20 to 30 million students actively using the platform monthly, accumulating about 200 million hours of learning annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. The social [[philanthropic_return_on_investment_in_education | return on investment]] ratio for Khan Academy's efficacy in classrooms is between 400 to 500 to 1, which is significantly higher than the typical philanthropic sector's good return of 5 to 1 or 10 to 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

## Global Aspirations and Disparity
Despite its global reach and impact, Khan Academy's annual budget is approximately one one-hundred thousandth of the five trillion dollars spent globally on education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. Its budget is comparable to that of a large high school, yet its mission is to serve the entire globe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>. There are billions of people worldwide who need access to resources to tap into their potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.

Khan views investments in Khan Academy as foundational for building a multi-generational institution that can help future generations, including those with the potential of figures like [[elon_musks_donation_to_khan_academy | Elon Musk]], to thrive and uplift civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

## Inspiration for a Grand Mission
Sal Khan draws inspiration from [[elon_musks_donation_to_khan_academy | Elon Musk]]'s achievements, recalling a 2013 interview where Musk outlined ambitious goals that he has since largely accomplished or is close to accomplishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. This serves as a powerful motivator for Khan, reaffirming that the mission to educate all of humanity is not too vast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. Khan believes that just as humanity should not shy away from solving climate change or colonizing other planets, it should not shy away from educating the planet and beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.

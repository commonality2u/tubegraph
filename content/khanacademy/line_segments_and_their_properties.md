## Introduction to Geometry
[[introduction_to_geometry_terms | Geometry]] is a field of mathematics that studies and seeks to understand how shapes and space relate to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>. The word "geometry" originates from "geo," referring to the earth, and "metry," referring to measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. Historically, it can be understood as "earth measurement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. Common topics in [[introduction_to_geometry_terms | geometry]] include [[rays_and_lines_in_geometry | lines]], [[right_triangles_and_their_properties | triangles]], [[properties_of_a_circle | circles]], and angles, as well as patterns and three-dimensional shapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

## Fundamental Concepts
### Points
The most basic starting point in [[introduction_to_geometry_terms | geometry]] is a dot, referred to as a [[understanding_points_and_dimensions | point]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. A [[understanding_points_and_dimensions | point]] is defined as a position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. One cannot move on a [[understanding_points_and_dimensions | point]]; if movement occurs in any direction, one is no longer at that [[understanding_points_and_dimensions | point]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. Therefore, a [[understanding_points_and_dimensions | point]] has zero [[understanding_points_and_dimensions | dimensions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.

To differentiate between multiple [[understanding_points_and_dimensions | points]], they are typically labeled with letters, such as Point A, Point B, Point C, or Point D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.

### Line Segments
A line segment consists of all the [[understanding_points_and_dimensions | points]] that connect two distinct [[understanding_points_and_dimensions | points]] along a straight path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. In mathematical terms, it is called a "line segment" rather than just a "line," as a [[rays_and_lines_in_geometry | line]] has a slightly different meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. A line segment can also be referred to simply as a "segment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>.

#### Properties and Notation
*   **Endpoints:** The two [[understanding_points_and_dimensions | points]] that define a line segment are called its endpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.
*   **Dimension:** A line segment is a one-dimensional object because one can only move back and forth along its length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>. A pure geometrical line segment has no width; it only has a length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>.
*   **Labeling:** A line segment is labeled using its two endpoints with a line drawn over them. For example, a line segment with endpoints A and B is denoted as $\overline{AB}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>. The order of the letters does not matter; $\overline{BA}$ refers to the same line segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>.
*   **Length/Distance:** To refer to the actual length or distance of a line segment, the line notation is omitted. For example, "AB = 5 units" means the length of line segment AB is 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>.

### Related Concepts
*   **Collinear Points:** [[understanding_points_and_dimensions | Points]] are considered [[introduction_to_geometry_terms | collinear]] if they all lie on the same [[rays_and_lines_in_geometry | line]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>. For instance, if X, Y, and Z are [[introduction_to_geometry_terms | collinear]], they lie on the same [[rays_and_lines_in_geometry | line]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>.
*   **Midpoint:** For a line segment, the midpoint is the [[understanding_points_and_dimensions | point]] that is exactly halfway between its two endpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>. If points X, Y, and Z are [[introduction_to_geometry_terms | collinear]] and the distance between X and Z is equal to the distance between Z and Y ($\overline{XZ} = \overline{ZY}$), then Z is the midpoint of line segment XY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>.

### Distinction from Rays and Lines
*   **[[rays_and_lines_in_geometry | Ray]]:** A [[rays_and_lines_in_geometry | ray]] starts at a [[understanding_points_and_dimensions | point]] (called the vertex) and extends infinitely in one direction through another [[understanding_points_and_dimensions | point]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>. It is denoted with an arrow over the letters, like $\overrightarrow{AD}$, where A is the starting point and it extends past D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>. The order of letters matters for a [[rays_and_lines_in_geometry | ray]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>.
*   **[[rays_and_lines_in_geometry | Line]]:** In [[introduction_to_geometry_terms | geometry]], a [[rays_and_lines_in_geometry | line]] is an object that extends infinitely in both directions, passing through two given [[understanding_points_and_dimensions | points]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. A [[rays_and_lines_in_geometry | line]] never ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>. It is denoted with a line with arrows on both ends over the letters, such as $\overleftrightarrow{EF}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a>.

Line segments are crucial in [[introduction_to_geometry_terms | geometry]] as they are concerned with the sides of shapes and distances between [[understanding_points_and_dimensions | points]], representing finite lengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>.

### Higher Dimensions
*   **Two [[understanding_points_and_dimensions | Dimensions]]:** Objects that allow movement backwards and forwards in two different directions are two-dimensional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>. Examples include a screen (allowing movement left/right and up/down) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a>. In [[introduction_to_geometry_terms | geometry]], these are referred to as [[introduction_to_geometry_terms | planes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>. A piece of paper that extends forever is a geometrical [[introduction_to_geometry_terms | plane]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>.
*   **Three [[understanding_points_and_dimensions | Dimensions]]:** Three-dimensional space allows movement not only left/right and up/down, but also in and out of the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>. While challenging to visualize, mathematics can study objects with more than three [[understanding_points_and_dimensions | dimensions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>.

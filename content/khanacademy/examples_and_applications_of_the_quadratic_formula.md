The [[introduction_to_the_quadratic_formula | quadratic formula]] is considered one of the most useful formulas in mathematics, primarily used to [[solving_quadratic_equations_using_the_quadratic_formula | solve for the roots, or zeroes, of quadratic equations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. While memorization is recommended, it's also important to understand its derivation from [[completing_the_square_and_derivation_of_the_quadratic_formula | completing the square]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## The Quadratic Formula Defined

For a general quadratic equation in the form `ax² + bx + c = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, where `a` is the coefficient of the `x²` term, `b` is the coefficient of the `x` term, and `c` is the constant term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>:

> x = -b ± √(b² - 4ac) / 2a <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>

## Applications of the Quadratic Formula

### Example 1: Solving a Factorable Equation

To demonstrate its function, the quadratic formula can be applied to an equation that can also be solved by [[factoring_quadratic_expressions | factoring]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

Consider the equation:
`x² + 4x - 21 = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>

Here, the coefficients are:
*   `a = 1` (coefficient of `x²`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>
*   `b = 4` (coefficient of `x`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>
*   `c = -21` (constant term) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>

Plugging these values into the quadratic formula:
x = -4 ± √(4² - 4 * 1 * -21) / (2 * 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>
x = -4 ± √(16 - (-84)) / 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>
x = -4 ± √(16 + 84) / 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>
x = -4 ± √100 / 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>
x = -4 ± 10 / 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>
x = -2 ± 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>

This yields two solutions:
*   x = -2 + 5 = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>
*   x = -2 - 5 = -7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>

**Verification by Factoring:**
The original equation `x² + 4x - 21 = 0` can be factored into `(x + 7)(x - 3) = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
Setting each factor to zero:
*   `x + 7 = 0` gives `x = -7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>
*   `x - 3 = 0` gives `x = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>
The solutions match, confirming the formula's accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

### Example 2: Equations with No Real Solutions

The quadratic formula is particularly useful for problems that are difficult or impossible to factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

Consider the equation:
`3x² + 6x = -10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>

First, rearrange it to the standard `ax² + bx + c = 0` form by adding 10 to both sides:
`3x² + 6x + 10 = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>

Here, the coefficients are:
*   `a = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>
*   `b = 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>
*   `c = 10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>

Plugging these values into the quadratic formula:
x = -6 ± √(6² - 4 * 3 * 10) / (2 * 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>
x = -6 ± √(36 - 120) / 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>
x = -6 ± √(-84) / 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>

Since the term under the square root (`b² - 4ac`, known as the discriminant) is negative (-84), there are no [[graphical_interpretation_of_quadratic_solutions | real solutions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. This means the parabola represented by the equation does not intersect the x-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. Solutions involving the square root of a negative number are called imaginary numbers and are explored in more advanced topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

### Example 3: Equations with Irrational Real Solutions

Consider the equation:
`-3x² + 12x + 1 = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>

Here, the coefficients are:
*   `a = -3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>
*   `b = 12` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>
*   `c = 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>

Plugging these values into the quadratic formula:
x = -12 ± √(12² - 4 * -3 * 1) / (2 * -3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>
x = -12 ± √(144 - (-12)) / -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>
x = -12 ± √(144 + 12) / -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>
x = -12 ± √156 / -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>

To simplify √156, factor 156: `156 = 2 * 78 = 2 * 2 * 39` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.
So, √156 = √(4 * 39) = 2√39 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

Substitute this back into the formula:
x = -12 ± 2√39 / -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>

Divide both terms in the numerator by the denominator:
x = (-12 / -6) ± (2√39 / -6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>
x = 2 ± (-√39 / 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>

The `±` sign already accounts for the positive and negative possibilities, so the solution can be written as:
x = 2 ± √39 / 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>

These solutions are irrational numbers, meaning they cannot be expressed as simple fractions. Graphing the equation `y = -3x² + 12x + 1` confirms it intersects the x-axis at two points corresponding to these values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.

The quadratic formula is a versatile tool for finding the roots of any quadratic equation, regardless of whether they are easily factorable, irrational, or even non-real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

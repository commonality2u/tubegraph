## What is a Linear Equation?

A [[representation_of_linear_equations|linear equation]] typically involves a variable (like 'x') multiplied by a number, equaling another number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. For instance, `5x = 20` is a [[representation_of_linear_equations|linear equation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This can be rephrased as "5 times what number equals 20?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

### Notation

In [[introduction_to_algebra|algebra]], when a number is written directly next to a variable (e.g., `5x`), it implies multiplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. So, `5x` means "5 times x" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Other ways to denote multiplication include using a dot (`-4/3 â‹… 10/13`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a> or writing a number next to parentheses `(-3/4)(-40/39)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. This is done to avoid confusion with the variable 'x' itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## [[solving_simple_linear_equations|Solving Linear Equations]]

While some simple [[solving_simple_linear_equations|linear equations]] can be solved mentally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, a systematic approach is necessary for more complex numbers or fractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. The core principle is to perform the same operation on both sides of the equation to isolate the variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

### Method 1: Division

To solve an equation like `ax = b`, you can divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient `a` (the number being multiplied by x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

*   **Example 1**: Solve `5x = 20`
    *   Divide both sides by 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>:
        `5x / 5 = 20 / 5`
    *   This simplifies to `x = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

### Method 2: Multiplication by the Reciprocal

This method is essentially the same as division but is often more intuitive when dealing with fractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. The reciprocal of a number `a` is `1/a`.

*   To solve `ax = b`, multiply both sides by `1/a` (the reciprocal of `a`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
    *   **Example 1 (Revisited)**: Solve `5x = 20`
        *   Multiply both sides by `1/5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>:
            `(1/5) * 5x = (1/5) * 20`
        *   This simplifies to `x = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

### Solving with Fractions

This method is particularly useful when the coefficient is a fraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

*   **Example 2**: Solve `-3/4x = 10/13` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>
    *   The coefficient is `-3/4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
    *   The reciprocal of `-3/4` is `-4/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
    *   Multiply both sides by `-4/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>:
        `(-4/3) * (-3/4x) = (-4/3) * (10/13)`
    *   On the left side, the terms cancel out, leaving `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
    *   On the right side, multiply the numerators and denominators:
        `x = (10 * -4) / (13 * 3)`
        `x = -40/39` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>

*   **Example 3**: Solve `-5/6x = 7/8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>
    *   The reciprocal of `-5/6` is `-6/5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
    *   Multiply both sides by `-6/5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>:
        `(-6/5) * (-5/6x) = (-6/5) * (7/8)`
    *   The left side simplifies to `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
    *   For the right side, simplify before multiplying (e.g., divide 6 and 8 by 2):
        `x = (-3/5) * (7/4)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>
        `x = (7 * -3) / (5 * 4)`
        `x = -21/20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>

## Checking Your Answer

A valuable aspect of [[introduction_to_algebra|algebra]] is the ability to verify your solution by substituting the obtained value of 'x' back into the original equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

*   **Checking Example 2**: Original equation `-3/4x = 10/13`. We found `x = -40/39`.
    *   Substitute `x`: `(-3/4) * (-40/39)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>
    *   Simplify before multiplying:
        *   `4` goes into `40` ten times.
        *   `3` goes into `39` thirteen times.
    *   `(-1/1) * (-10/13)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>
    *   Positive 10/13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
    *   Since `10/13 = 10/13`, the solution is correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

*   **Checking Example 3**: Original equation `-5/6x = 7/8`. We found `x = -21/20`.
    *   Substitute `x`: `(-5/6) * (-21/20)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>
    *   Simplify:
        *   `5` goes into `20` four times.
        *   `6` and `21` can both be divided by `3` (resulting in `2` and `7`).
    *   `(-1/2) * (-7/4)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>
    *   Negative times negative is positive.
    *   `7 / (2 * 4) = 7/8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>
    *   Since `7/8 = 7/8`, the solution is correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

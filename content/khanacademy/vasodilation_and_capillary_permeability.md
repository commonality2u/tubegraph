The [[inflammatory_response_overview | inflammatory response]], characterized by redness, swelling, heat, and pain following an injury, is the initial field of battle for the [[innate_immune_system_and_first_line_barriers | immune system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. When a pathogen, like bacteria from a puncture wound, breaches the body's first line of defense (e.g., skin), cells at the site of damage, along with mast cells, release chemical messengers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

## Role of Histamine and Chemokines
When the skin is pierced and damaged, affected cells release chemical messengers called chemokines, signaling that something is wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. These chemokines, along with direct contact with the invading pathogen or other molecules released by bacteria, activate mast cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Activated mast cells, in turn, release [[role_of_histamine_in_inflammation | histamine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

## Vasodilation
[[role_of_histamine_in_inflammation | Histamine]] acts on the endothelial cells that line capillaries, causing them to separate and the capillaries themselves to enlarge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. This process is known as vasodilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

### Symptoms of Vasodilation
*   **Swelling:** As capillaries become larger, more fluid and red blood cells collect in the affected area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. If the capillary narrows further down, it encourages fluid to collect locally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. This fluid collection, called exudate, leads to macro-level swelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.
*   **Redness and Heat:** The increased blood flow and fluid collection in the area contribute to the visible redness and increased heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Increased Capillary Permeability
Beyond just enlarging, the capillary walls also become more porous due to [[role_of_histamine_in_inflammation | histamine]]'s effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. This increased permeability allows substances that normally couldn't easily pass through the capillary walls to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

### Facilitating Immune Response
The increased permeability is crucial for the immune response:
*   **Cellular Recruitment:** Phagocytes, particularly [[role_of_neutrophils_and_other_white_blood_cells | neutrophils]] (the most abundant type), are attracted to the site of damage by the chemokines released locally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. With the wider gaps in the capillary walls, [[role_of_neutrophils_and_other_white_blood_cells | neutrophils]] can adhere to the wall (marginalization) and then squeeze through the gaps (diapedesis or extravasation) into the interstitial fluid where they are needed to engulf bacteria and damaged cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
*   **Specific Immune Cell Access:** This congestion and increased permeability also allows [[cellmediated_response_and_t_lymphocytes | B-cells]] and [[cellmediated_response_and_t_lymphocytes | T-cells]] to migrate to the battleground, where they can be activated for the specific immune response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
*   **Complement System Activation:** Proteins of the complement system, normally inactive in blood plasma, become activated during the [[inflammatory_response_overview | inflammatory response]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. These activated proteins non-specifically help to eliminate invading pathogens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Antihistamines
> Antihistamines are medications that attempt to shut down the [[inflammatory_response_overview | inflammatory response]] by counteracting the effects of [[role_of_histamine_in_inflammation | histamine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. While they can alleviate symptoms like a runny or stuffy nose associated with colds, it's important to remember that the [[inflammatory_response_overview | inflammatory response]] is the [[innate_immune_system_and_first_line_barriers | immune system]]'s crucial first line of defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

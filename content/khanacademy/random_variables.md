[[random_variables_in_probability | Random variables]] exist in two primary forms: [[discrete_random_variables | discrete random variables]] and [[continuous_random_variables | continuous random variables]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## [[discrete_random_variables | Discrete Random Variables]]

[[discrete_random_variables | Discrete random variables]] are those that can assume distinct or separate values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The term "discrete" here refers to values that are distinguishable and individual, not to the English meaning of polite or subtle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

A key characteristic of [[discrete_random_variables | discrete random variables]] is that their possible values can be counted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This means you can list them, even if the list is infinitely long. As long as you can conceptually say, "this is the first value, this is the second value," and so on, it's a [[discrete_random_variables | discrete random variable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

### [[examples_of_discrete_variables | Examples of Discrete Variables]]

*   **Coin Flip Outcome**
    *   A [[random_variables_in_probability | random variable]] `X` defined as 1 if a fair coin is heads and 0 if tails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
    *   This is [[discrete_random_variables | discrete]] because it can only take on two distinct values: 0 or 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

*   **Year of Birth**
    *   The year a random student in a class was born <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
    *   This is [[discrete_random_variables | discrete]] as it will be a specific, countable year (e.g., 1992, 1985, 2001) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. It cannot be a value between two years, like 2000.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

*   **Number of Ants Born**
    *   The number of ants born tomorrow in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
    *   This is [[discrete_random_variables | discrete]] because the number of ants can be counted (e.g., 1, 2, 3, or even quadrillions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. Even if this number could be infinitely large, it remains countable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

*   **Rounded Winning Time**
    *   The winning time for the men's 100-meter dash at the 2016 Olympics, *rounded to the nearest hundredth* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.
    *   By rounding, the values become countable (e.g., 9.56, 9.57, 9.58 seconds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>, making it a [[discrete_random_variables | discrete random variable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

## [[continuous_random_variables | Continuous Random Variables]]

[[continuous_random_variables | Continuous random variables]] are those that can assume any value within a given range or interval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This range can even be infinite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

Unlike [[discrete_random_variables | discrete random variables]], it is impossible to count or list all the possible values a [[continuous_random_variables | continuous random variable]] can take <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Even between two seemingly close values, there are an infinite number of other possible values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

### Examples of Continuous Variables

*   **Mass of an Animal**
    *   The exact mass of a random animal selected at the New Orleans zoo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
    *   This is [[continuous_random_variables | continuous]] because an animal's exact mass can be any value within a range (e.g., between close to 0 kg and 5,000 kg or more) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. For example, it could be 123.75921 kilograms, or even more precise with an infinite number of decimal places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

*   **Exact Winning Time**
    *   The exact winning time for the men's 100-meter dash at the 2016 Olympics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
    *   While clocks might round to the nearest hundredth, the *exact* time can take on any value within an interval (e.g., between 5 and 12 seconds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. It could be 9.571 or 9.572359 seconds, with an infinite number of decimal places possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. This means it is a [[continuous_random_variables | continuous random variable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

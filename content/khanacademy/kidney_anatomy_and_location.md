The kidney is an organ most famous for allowing the body to [[processes_of_blood_filtration_and_waste_excretion | excrete waste]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Beyond waste excretion, the kidney also helps maintain the body's water and salt (electrolytes) levels, as well as blood pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Additionally, kidneys produce hormones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. These constitute the [[functions_of_the_kidney | overview function of the kidney]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

Most individuals have two kidneys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, located closer to the back, on either side of the spine, and behind the liver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### Internal Anatomy
When a kidney is sliced open to reveal its internal structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, two main regions are visible:

*   **Renal Cortex** The outer part of the kidney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, extending from the exterior to a certain depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. The term "renal" always refers to the kidney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **Renal Medulla** The inner, or middle, part of the kidney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

Both the renal cortex and renal medulla play crucial roles in the kidney's [[processes_of_blood_filtration_and_waste_excretion | filtration]] and [[processes_of_blood_filtration_and_waste_excretion | waste excretion]] processes, as well as in preventing excessive [[water_and_electrolyte_reabsorption_mechanisms | water loss]] during blood filtration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

The smallest functional unit of the kidney is the [[structure_and_function_of_the_nephron | nephron]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. An average kidney contains approximately one million nephrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. These microscopic tubules are responsible for the kidney's major functions: waste excretion and water level maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. A nephron typically begins in the renal cortex, dips down into the renal medulla, then returns to the cortex before emptying into collecting ducts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. The fluid collected eventually reaches the ureters and then the urinary bladder for excretion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

When solving a quadratic equation like `s² - 2s - 35 = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, especially one set to zero, [[solving_quadratic_equations_by_factoring | factoring]] the expression on the left-hand side is often the most efficient approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. While [[factoring_by_grouping_technique | factoring by grouping]] is a valid method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, a shortcut exists for specific types of quadratic expressions.

## Shortcut for Quadratics with a Leading Coefficient of 1

A significant shortcut is available when the leading coefficient of the quadratic expression is 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, meaning the `s²` (or `x²`) term has a coefficient of 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This applies to [[factoring_quadratics_with_a_leading_coefficient_of_1 | quadratics with a leading coefficient of 1]].

### Understanding the Pattern
Consider the product of two binomials: `(x + a)(x + b)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
When expanded, this results in:
`x * x = x²` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>
`x * b = bx` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>
`a * x = ax` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>
`a * b = ab` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>

Combining these terms yields:
`x² + bx + ax + ab` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>
`x² + (a + b)x + ab` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>

This pattern demonstrates that for a quadratic expression in the form `x² + Px + Q`, the coefficient `P` is the sum of two numbers (`a + b`), and the constant term `Q` is the product of those same two numbers (`a * b`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. This is the core of [[product_and_sum_relationships_in_factoring | product and sum relationships in factoring]].

### Applying the Shortcut

For the equation `s² - 2s - 35 = 0`:

1.  **Identify coefficients**:
    *   The coefficient of `s²` is 1 (leading coefficient).
    *   The coefficient of `s` (the middle term) is -2. This will be the sum (`a + b`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
    *   The constant term is -35. This will be the product (`a * b`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

2.  **Find two numbers**:
    Look for two numbers that:
    *   Add up to -2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
    *   Multiply to -35 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
    Since the product is negative, one number must be positive and the other negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
    The numbers are 5 and -7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>:
    *   5 + (-7) = -2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>
    *   5 * (-7) = -35 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>

3.  **Directly factor**:
    Once these two numbers (5 and -7) are identified, the quadratic expression can be directly factored into the product of two binomials using these numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>:
    `(s + 5)(s - 7) = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>

This shortcut significantly reduces the steps compared to [[factoring_by_grouping_technique | factoring by grouping]] when the leading coefficient is 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

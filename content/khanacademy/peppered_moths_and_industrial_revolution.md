The concept of natural selection is well-illustrated by the example of the peppered moth during England's Industrial Revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>. Natural selection is a process where environmental factors select for certain variations within a population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.

## Natural Variation

In any population of living organisms, there is variation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. Before the Industrial Revolution, peppered moths in England exhibited natural variation in their coloration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>. Some moths were more "peppered" (lighter with spots), while others might have had very few spots, showing a range of colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. For thousands of years, this variation in color was not a significant trait for the moths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>.

## Impact of the Industrial Revolution

The Industrial Revolution in England led to factories releasing significant amounts of soot from coal-powered steam engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>. This soot covered the environment, making many previously grey or white surfaces, such as tree trunks, become pitch black or significantly darker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>. This drastic change in the environment created a new selective pressure for the moths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>.

## Natural Selection in Action

Birds were predators of the peppered moths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>. On the soot-darkened trees, the lighter-colored moths became much easier for birds to see compared to the darker moths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>. While birds would catch both, they caught the lighter moths much more frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.

As a result:
*   Lighter moths were caught before they could reproduce or produced fewer offspring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>.
*   Darker moths reproduced more often, as they were better camouflaged and thus preyed upon less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>.

Over generations, the darker trait became dominant within the peppered moth population, effectively turning them into what could be viewed as "black moths" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>.

This change was not a conscious decision or active design by the moths themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>. Instead, it was a result of existing random variation within the population combined with the environmental change (darkened trees) that favored the survival and reproduction of darker individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>. The lighter moths simply had less success in reproducing, leading to the dominance of the darker trait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>.

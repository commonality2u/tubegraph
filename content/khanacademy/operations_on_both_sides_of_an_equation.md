When solving equations, the fundamental principle is that any operation performed on one side of the equation must also be performed on the other side to maintain equality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:01">[04:43:01]</a>. This ensures that the transformed equation remains [[understanding_equivalent_expressions_in_algebra | equivalent]] to the original <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This systematic approach is crucial for solving more complex equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:99">[01:03:99]</a>.

## Understanding Algebraic Notation

An equation like `7x = 14` means "7 times x is equal to 14" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. In algebra, the multiplication symbol is often omitted when a number is written next to a variable, acting as a shorthand notation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The traditional multiplication sign (×) is generally avoided because 'x' is the most common variable used in algebra, which can lead to confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. A dot (•) may be used for multiplication, but simply writing the number and variable together (e.g., `7x`) is the most common form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Solving Basic Equations

Consider the equation `7x = 14` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
Intuitively, one might find the solution by recalling multiplication tables (7 times 2 equals 14, so x = 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. However, for a systematic approach, the goal is to isolate the variable.

### Visualizing the Equation

The term `7x` literally means `x` added to itself 7 times (x + x + x + x + x + x + x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. The equation `7x = 14` states that seven instances of 'x' are equivalent to 14 objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.

### Applying Division to Both Sides

To solve `7x = 14` systematically, the standard procedure is to [[dividing_both_sides_of_an_equation | divide both sides]] by the coefficient (the number multiplying the variable), which in this case is 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.

```
7x / 7 = 14 / 7
```

On the left side, the 7s cancel out, leaving `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>. On the right side, 14 divided by 7 equals 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.
Thus, `x = 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.

Visually, if you have 7 groups of 'x' equal to 14 objects, [[dividing_both_sides_of_an_equation | dividing both sides]] by 7 means splitting both quantities into 7 equal groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>. Each group of 'x' will then correspond to 2 objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.

### Equivalence of Division and Multiplication

Consider the equation `3x = 15` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>.
One method is to [[dividing_both_sides_of_an_equation | divide both sides]] by 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>:
```
3x / 3 = 15 / 3
x = 5
```
Alternatively, one can [[reciprocal_multiplication_in_equations | multiply both sides]] by the reciprocal of the coefficient, which is 1/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>:
```
(1/3) * 3x = (1/3) * 15
1x = 5
x = 5
```
[[understanding_equivalent_expressions_in_algebra | Dividing both sides by 3]] is [[understanding_equivalent_expressions_in_algebra | equivalent]] to [[reciprocal_multiplication_in_equations | multiplying both sides by 1/3]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>.

## Solving Equations with Multiple Terms

For equations like `2y + 4y = 18`, where the variable appears in multiple terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>:

### Combining Like Terms

The first step is to [[combining_like_terms_in_equations | combine like terms]] on one side of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>.
`2y` represents two instances of `y` (y + y), and `4y` represents four instances of `y` (y + y + y + y) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>.
Adding them together:
```
(y + y) + (y + y + y + y) = 6y
```
So, the equation simplifies to `6y = 18` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:00">[09:45:00]</a>. This is analogous to [[applying_arithmetic_to_algebra | arithmetic]]: "2 apples plus 4 apples equals 6 apples" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>.

### Final Solution

Once simplified, the equation `6y = 18` can be solved by [[dividing_both_sides_of_an_equation | dividing both sides]] by 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>:
```
6y / 6 = 18 / 6
y = 3
```
To verify the solution, substitute `y = 3` back into the original equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>:
```
2(3) + 4(3) = 6 + 12 = 18
```
Since 18 equals 18, the solution is correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>.

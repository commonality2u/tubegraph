[[introduction_to_algebra|Algebra]] and further mathematical studies depend on a solid understanding of the [[importance_of_order_of_operations_in_mathematics|importance of order of operations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The primary purpose of an [[agreed_upon_order_of_operations|agreed upon order of operations]] is to ensure that there is only one way to [[understanding_arithmetic_and_expressions|interpret a mathematical statement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Why Order of Operations is Necessary

Without a set order, a single mathematical statement could be interpreted in multiple ways, leading to different results. This inconsistency is unacceptable in mathematics, as it could lead to critical errors in real-world applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

### [[examples_of_different_interpretations_without_a_set_order_of_operations|Example of Ambiguity]]

Consider the expression: `7 + 3 * 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>

1.  **Interpretation 1 (Left-to-Right):**
    *   First, add 7 and 3: `7 + 3 = 10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>
    *   Then, multiply the result by 5: `10 * 5 = 50` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>
    *   This approach is often a natural way to interpret statements if no other rules apply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

2.  **Interpretation 2 (Multiplication First):**
    *   First, multiply 3 and 5: `3 * 5 = 15` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>
    *   Then, add 7 to the result: `7 + 15 = 22` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>
    *   These two interpretations yield different answers (50 versus 22) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, highlighting the need for a universally agreed-upon standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## The Agreed-Upon Order of Operations

The [[agreed_upon_order_of_operations|agreed upon order of operations]] provides a clear hierarchy for solving mathematical expressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

1.  **Parentheses** `()` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>
    *   Operations within parentheses are always performed first.
2.  **Exponents** (e.g., `xÂ²`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>
    *   Powers and roots come next. (Note: Exponents are not covered in detail in this video's examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.)
3.  **Multiplication and Division** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>
    *   These operations have the same level of priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. When both are present, perform them from left to right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
4.  **Addition and Subtraction** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>
    *   These operations also have the same level of priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. When both are present, perform them from left to right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

## [[solving_arithmetic_expressions_using_order_of_operations|Solving Arithmetic Expressions Using Order of Operations]]

Following the defined order ensures a consistent and correct solution for any given expression.

### Example 1: `7 + 3 * 5`

Applying the order of operations:
*   There are no parentheses or exponents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   **Multiplication** takes priority over addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>:
    *   `3 * 5 = 15` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>
*   Then, **Addition**:
    *   `7 + 15 = 22` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>

Therefore, the correct interpretation of `7 + 3 * 5` is `22` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

### Example 2: `(7 + 3) * 4 / 2 - 5 * 6`

Let's simplify this expression step-by-step:

1.  **Parentheses**:
    *   First, calculate the expression inside the parentheses: `(7 + 3) = 10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
    *   The expression becomes: `10 * 4 / 2 - 5 * 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>

2.  **Exponents**:
    *   There are no exponents in this expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

3.  **Multiplication and Division** (Left to Right):
    *   Perform `10 * 4`: `40` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>
    *   The expression becomes: `40 / 2 - 5 * 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>
    *   Perform `40 / 2`: `20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>
    *   The expression becomes: `20 - 5 * 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>
    *   Perform `5 * 6`: `30` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>
    *   The expression becomes: `20 - 30` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>

4.  **Addition and Subtraction**:
    *   Perform `20 - 30`: `-10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>

The final result is `-10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

### Operations at the Same Level

When multiple operations of the same priority level appear (e.g., only multiplication and division, or only addition and subtraction), they should be performed from **left to right** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

*   **Example (Addition & Subtraction):** `1 + 2 - 3 + 4 - 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>
    *   `1 + 2 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>
    *   `3 - 3 = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>
    *   `0 + 4 = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>
    *   `4 - 1 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>

*   **Example (Multiplication & Division):** `4 * 2 / 3 * 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>
    *   `4 * 2 = 8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>
    *   `8 / 3 = 8/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>
    *   `8/3 * 2 = 16/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>

### When Order Doesn't Strictly Matter

The order of operations can be more flexible when an expression contains **only** addition or **only** [[basic_multiplication_concepts|multiplication]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

*   **Only Addition:** `1 + 5 + 7 + 3 + 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>
    *   The sum will be the same regardless of the order of addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
*   **Only Multiplication:** `1 * 5 * 7 * 3 * 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>
    *   The product will be the same regardless of the order of [[basic_multiplication_concepts|multiplication]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

However, if an expression includes a mix of addition/subtraction or multiplication/division, always adhere to the left-to-right rule within that priority level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

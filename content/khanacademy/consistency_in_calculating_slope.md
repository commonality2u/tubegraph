[[understanding_the_concept_of_slope | Slope]] is a fundamental concept in mathematics that describes how steep a line is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. It quantifies the rate of change of the y-coordinate with respect to the x-coordinate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. For a straight line, the [[slope_of_a_straight_line | slope]] remains constant across any two points on the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Defining Slope

The [[understanding_slope_as_change_in_y_over_change_in_x | slope]] of a line is defined as the "change in y over change in x" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This is often represented using the Greek letter delta (Δ) to denote "change in," so slope is expressed as Δy/Δx <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Calculating Slope from a Graph

To [[interpreting_slope_from_a_graph | find the slope of a line from a graph]], select any two distinct points on the line that have clear integer coordinates for ease of calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

### Example 1: Moving Right

Consider two points on a line. If we start at a point (implied as (-3,-3)) and move to another point (implied as (0,-1)):
*   The [[finding_the_slope_of_a_line | change in x]] (Δx) is observed by moving 3 units to the right, from -3 to 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, so Δx = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   The change in y (Δy) is observed by moving 2 units upwards, from -3 to -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, so Δy = 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   The slope is Δy/Δx = 2/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

### Example 2: Moving Left

The same slope value will be obtained even if different points are chosen or if the direction of movement is reversed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

If we start at a point (implied as (3,1)) and move to another point (implied as (-3,-3)):
*   The change in y (Δy) is observed by moving 4 units downwards, from 1 to -3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, so Δy = -4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   The [[finding_the_slope_of_a_line | change in x]] (Δx) is observed by moving 6 units to the left, from 3 to -3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>, so Δx = -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   The slope is Δy/Δx = -4/-6 = 2/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## Conclusion

Regardless of which two points you select on a straight line, and regardless of the direction of movement (left/right, up/down), the calculated [[slope_of_a_line_in_algebra | slope]] will always be the same, provided consistency is maintained in defining the start and end points for both x and y changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. This demonstrates the consistency when [[using_different_points_to_determine_slope | using different points to determine slope]].

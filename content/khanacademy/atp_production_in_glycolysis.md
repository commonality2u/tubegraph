[[overview_of_glycolysis | Glycolysis]] is a crucial biochemical pathway found in nearly all forms of life, primarily focused on breaking down [[role_of_glucose_in_energy_production | glucose]] for energy production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. A key outcome of this [[glycolysis_process and its role in breaking down glucose | process]] is the direct generation of ATP.

## [[net_energy_yield_in_glycolysis | Net Energy Yield]]

The [[glycolysis_process_and_phases | glycolysis process]] directly produces a net of two ATP molecules per glucose molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. While the overall yield is two, the process involves both an investment phase where ATP is consumed and a payoff phase where ATP is produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

## [[glycolysis_process_and_phases | Phases of ATP Generation]]

### Investment Phase
In the initial stages of glycolysis, energy is consumed to prepare the [[role_of_glucose_in_energy_production | glucose]] molecule for cleavage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   **Step 1: Phosphorylation of Glucose**
    *   One ATP molecule is used to phosphorylate [[role_of_glucose_in_energy_production | glucose]] into [[role_of_glucose_in_energy_production | glucose]] 6-phosphate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. This reaction is facilitated by the [[enzymes_involved_in_glycolysis | enzyme]] hexokinase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   **Step 3: Second Phosphorylation**
    *   Another ATP molecule is consumed when fructose 6-phosphate is phosphorylated to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. This step is catalyzed by the [[enzymes_involved_in_glycolysis | enzyme]] phosphofructokinase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
In total, two ATP molecules are invested in this phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

### Payoff Phase
After the initial 6-carbon molecule is cleaved into two 3-carbon molecules (specifically, two molecules of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate), the payoff phase begins, where ATP is generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.
*   **ATP Generation 1**
    *   In the conversion of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to 3-phosphoglycerate, one phosphate group is transferred to ADP, producing ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Since there are two 3-carbon molecules proceeding through the pathway, this step yields two ATPs per [[role_of_glucose_in_energy_production | glucose]] molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. This reaction is catalyzed by phosphoglycerate kinase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
*   **ATP Generation 2**
    *   The final step of mainstream [[overview_of_glycolysis | glycolysis]] involves the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate (or pyruvic acid) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. This reaction, catalyzed by pyruvate kinase, defosphorylates the molecule and produces another ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. Again, because this happens for both 3-carbon molecules, another two ATPs are produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

In summary, the [[glycolysis_process_and_phases | payoff phase]] produces a total of four ATP molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Overall Balance

With two ATPs consumed in the [[glycolysis_process_and_phases | investment phase]] and four ATPs produced in the [[glycolysis_process_and_phases | payoff phase]], the [[net_energy_yield_in_glycolysis | net ATP production]] directly from [[overview_of_glycolysis | glycolysis]] is two ATP molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

Beyond direct ATP production, [[overview_of_glycolysis | glycolysis]] also involves the reduction of NAD+ to [[role_of_nad_in_glycolysis | NADH]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This [[role_of_nad_in_glycolysis | NADH]] can then be utilized in the electron transport chain (as part of oxidative phosphorylation) to generate even more ATP in the presence of oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

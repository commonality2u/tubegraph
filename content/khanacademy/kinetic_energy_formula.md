This article explores the fundamental [[definitions_of_work_and_energy | concepts of work and energy]] in physics, culminating in the derivation and definition of the [[equations_for_work_and_kinetic_energy | kinetic energy formula]].

## What is Work? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>

In everyday language, "work" has a common meaning, but in physics, it takes on a specific definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. [[work_in_physics | Work]] is defined as [[energy_concepts | energy]] transferred by a force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This definition, sourced from Wikipedia, aims to be intuitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### What is Energy? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>

[[energy_concepts | Energy]] is defined as the ability to do [[work_in_physics | work]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. This means that the [[definitions_of_work_and_energy | definitions of work and energy]] are somewhat circular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, with each concept defining the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. While these verbal definitions may seem limited, understanding their mathematical expressions provides a more quantitative and intuitive grasp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Work in Mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>

In mechanics, the definition of [[work_in_physics | work]] is quantitatively expressed as:

$$
\text{Work} = \text{Force} \times \text{Distance}
$$

<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>

If a force of 10 Newtons (N) is applied to move a block 7 meters (m) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, the work done is:

$$
\text{Work} = 10 \text{ N} \times 7 \text{ m} = 70 \text{ Newton meters}
$$

<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>

### Units of Work and Energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>

The unit "Newton meters" is also defined as one Joule (J) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The Joule is the standard unit for both [[work_in_physics | work]] and [[energy_concepts | energy]], emphasizing their interchangeable nature within these [[definitions_of_work_and_energy | definitions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

## Deriving the Kinetic Energy Formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>

Consider a block of mass 'm' that starts at rest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. A constant force 'F' is applied to the block, pushing it a distance 'd' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Assuming no friction, this force will cause the block to accelerate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

To determine the block's final [[Speed vs velocity | velocity]] ('v') after being pushed, we can use [[Basic concepts in onedimensional motion | kinematics equations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. One such equation is:

$$
v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2ad
$$

<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>

Where:
*   $v_f$ is the final velocity
*   $v_i$ is the initial velocity
*   $a$ is acceleration
*   $d$ is distance

In this scenario:
1.  The initial [[Speed vs velocity | velocity]] ($v_i$) is 0, as the block starts at rest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
    Therefore, the equation simplifies to:
    $$
    v_f^2 = 2ad
    $$
    <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>
2.  From Newton's second law, Force (F) equals mass (m) times acceleration (a), or $F = ma$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
    This means acceleration ($a$) can be expressed as $a = F/m$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
3.  Substitute $a = F/m$ into the kinematics equation:
    $$
    v_f^2 = 2 \left( \frac{F}{m} \right) d
    $$
    $$
    v_f^2 = \frac{2Fd}{m}
    $$
    <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>
4.  Recall that [[work_in_physics | work]] (W) is defined as Force $\times$ distance ($W = Fd$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
    Substitute 'W' for 'Fd' in the equation:
    $$
    v_f^2 = \frac{2W}{m}
    $$
    <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>
5.  To find the work done, multiply both sides by 'm' and divide by '2':
    $$
    m v_f^2 = 2W
    $$
    $$
    W = \frac{1}{2} m v_f^2
    $$
    <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>

### The Kinetic Energy Formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>

The work imputed into an object to accelerate it from rest to a certain [[Speed vs velocity | velocity]] is defined as its **kinetic energy** (KE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Kinetic [[energy_concepts | energy]] is the [[energy_concepts | energy]] an object possesses due to its motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

The formula for kinetic energy is:

$$
\text{KE} = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
$$

<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>

Where:
*   KE is kinetic energy (in Joules)
*   m is mass (in kilograms)
*   v is [[Speed vs velocity | velocity]] (in meters per second)

This is a very common formula in physics and represents one fundamental form of [[energy_concepts | energy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. The next steps in understanding [[energy_concepts | energy concepts]] involve exploring other forms of [[energy_concepts | energy]] and the [[energy_concepts | law of conservation of energy]], which explains how [[energy_concepts | energy]] transforms between different forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

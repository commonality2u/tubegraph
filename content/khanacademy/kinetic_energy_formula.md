In physics, the [[concept_of_work_in_physics | concepts of work]] and [[definition_and_understanding_of_energy | energy]] have specific meanings, though they are somewhat related to their everyday usage [00:00:02]. While these terms can be circularly defined, understanding them through equations provides a more quantitative perspective [00:00:25].

## Defining Work and Energy

In general terms, work is defined as [[definition_and_understanding_of_energy | energy]] transferred by a force [00:00:35]. Conversely, [[definition_and_understanding_of_energy | energy]] is defined as the ability to do work [00:01:23].

> [!NOTE] Circular Definitions
> Work is "energy transferred by a force" [00:00:35].
> Energy is "the ability to do work" [00:01:23].
> These definitions rely on each other [00:01:27], but become clearer through their mathematical relationships.

### Work in Mechanics
In mechanics, the definition of [[concept_of_work_in_physics | work]] is quantitatively expressed as:
$$
\text{Work} = \text{Force} \times \text{Distance}
$$
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>

For example, if a force of 10 Newtons is applied to a block, moving it 7 meters, the work done is:
$$
\text{Work} = 10 \text{ N} \times 7 \text{ m} = 70 \text{ Newton meters}
$$

## Units of Work and Energy
The unit for [[concept_of_work_in_physics | work]] and [[definition_and_understanding_of_energy | energy]] is the Joule (J) [00:03:06]. One Newton meter (NÂ·m) is equivalent to one Joule [00:03:00].

## Deriving the Kinetic Energy Formula
Consider a block of mass ($m$) starting at rest (initial velocity $v_i = 0$) [00:03:53]. A constant force ($F$) is applied to the block, moving it a distance ($d$) [00:04:00]. Since force ($F$) equals mass ($m$) times acceleration ($a$) ($F=ma$), the block will accelerate [00:04:48].

To find the final velocity ($v_f$) of the block after being accelerated over a distance, we can use a [[examples_of_vectors_and_scalars_in_motion | kinematic]] equation:
$$
v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2ad
$$
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>

Given that the initial velocity ($v_i$) is 0 (the block starts at rest) [00:05:38], the equation simplifies to:
$$
v_f^2 = 2ad
$$
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>

From Newton's second law, acceleration ($a$) can be expressed as force ($F$) divided by mass ($m$) ($a = F/m$) [00:06:03]:
$$
v_f^2 = 2 \left( \frac{F}{m} \right) d
$$
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>

Rearranging the equation to isolate $F \times d$ (which is work):
$$
m v_f^2 = 2 (F \times d)
$$
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>
Since Work ($W$) = Force ($F$) $\times$ Distance ($d$) [01:47:00]:
$$
m v_f^2 = 2W
$$
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>

Solving for Work ($W$):
$$
W = \frac{1}{2} m v_f^2
$$
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>

This expression for work, when applied to an object to accelerate it from rest to a certain velocity, defines its [[definition_and_understanding_of_energy | energy]] due to motion.

## Kinetic Energy
The [[definition_and_understanding_of_energy | energy]] an object possesses due to its motion is called **kinetic energy** [08:26:00]. It is the work needed to accelerate an object from being stationary to its current velocity [08:35:00].

The formula for kinetic energy (KE) is:
$$
\text{KE} = \frac{1}{2} m v^2
$$
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>
where:
*   $m$ is the mass of the object (in kilograms)
*   $v$ is the velocity of the object (in meters per second)

This formula allows us to calculate how much [[concept_of_work_in_physics | work]] was put into an object to get it to a certain velocity, or how much [[definition_and_understanding_of_energy | energy]] it possesses due to its motion [08:09:00].

In subsequent discussions, other forms of [[definition_and_understanding_of_energy | energy]] will be introduced, leading to the [[law_of_conservation_of_energy | law of conservation of energy]], which explains how different forms of [[definition_and_understanding_of_energy | energy]] can be converted into one another [09:02:00].

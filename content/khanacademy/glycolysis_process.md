[[glycolysis | Glycolysis]] is the first of three main phases of cellular respiration, which also include the [[krebs_cycle | Krebs cycle]] and the electron transport chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The term "[[glycolysis | glycolysis]]" literally means the breaking down of glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

[[glycolysis | Glycolysis]] can occur either with or without the presence of oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>:
*   **Without oxygen** If oxygen is absent, the process leads to fermentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. In humans, this produces lactic acid, while other organisms may produce alcohol or ethanol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   **With oxygen** If oxygen is present, [[glycolysis | glycolysis]] proceeds to the [[krebs_cycle | Krebs cycle]] (also known as the citric acid cycle) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, and then to the electron transport chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The electron transport chain is where the bulk of ATP is produced, utilizing raw materials from the earlier phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## [[overview_of_glycolysis | Overview of Glycolysis]]

[[glycolysis | Glycolysis]] begins with glucose, which has the chemical formula C6H12O6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Glucose is a six-carbon compound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. The process of [[glycolysis | glycolysis]] is generally divided into two important phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>: the [[investment_and_payoff_phases_of_glycolysis | Investment Phase]] and the [[investment_and_payoff_phases_of_glycolysis | Payoff Phase]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

### [[investment_and_payoff_phases_of_glycolysis | Investment Phase]]

The [[investment_and_payoff_phases_of_glycolysis | investment phase]] of [[glycolysis | glycolysis]] consumes two ATP molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. The purpose of this initial investment is to break down the six-carbon glucose molecule into two 3-carbon compounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. These 3-carbon compounds, often referred to as PGAL (phosphoglyceraldehyde) or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, also acquire a phosphate group from the invested ATPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Each of these two PGAL molecules will then proceed into the payoff phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

### [[investment_and_payoff_phases_of_glycolysis | Payoff Phase]]

In the [[investment_and_payoff_phases_of_glycolysis | payoff phase]], each of the two PGAL molecules is converted into pyruvate (or pyruvic acid) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Pyruvate is another 3-carbon molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>, and it represents the end product of [[glycolysis | glycolysis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Since one glucose molecule yields two PGALs, the payoff phase ultimately produces two molecules of pyruvate for every starting glucose molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

During this phase, two key energy-carrying molecules are produced from each PGAL:
*   **ATP**: Each PGAL molecule yields two ATPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Since there are two PGAL molecules, a total of four ATPs are produced in the payoff phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
*   **NADH**: Each PGAL molecule also produces one NADH molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. This occurs as NAD+ is reduced by gaining a hydrogen atom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, essentially gaining electrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. Since there are two PGALs, a total of two NADHs are produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. These NADHs will later be used in the electron transport chain to generate additional ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

## [[atp_production_and_consumption_in_glycolysis | ATP Production and Consumption]]

When considering the [[atp_production_and_consumption_in_glycolysis | ATP production and consumption]] in [[glycolysis | glycolysis]]:
*   **Investment**: 2 ATPs are used in the [[investment_and_payoff_phases_of_glycolysis | investment phase]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   **Payoff**: 4 ATPs are produced in the [[investment_and_payoff_phases_of_glycolysis | payoff phase]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

This results in a **net gain of 2 ATPs** directly from [[glycolysis | glycolysis]] per molecule of glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

## Overall [[glycolysis_process_and_outcomes | Outcomes]]

The overall reaction and [[glycolysis_process_and_outcomes | outcomes]] of [[glycolysis | glycolysis]] starting with one glucose molecule can be summarized as follows:

**Inputs:**
*   1 Glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>
*   2 NAD+ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>
*   2 ATP (consumed in investment phase) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>
*   4 ADP (to be converted to ATP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>
*   4 Phosphate groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>

**Outputs:**
*   2 Pyruvates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>
*   2 NADH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>
*   2 ADP (from the initial ATP investment) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>
*   4 ATP (gross production from payoff phase) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>

**Net Outputs:**
*   2 ATP (net gain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>
*   2 NADH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>
*   2 Pyruvates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>

The two NADH molecules can subsequently be used in the electron transport chain to produce about three ATPs each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. The two pyruvate molecules will be re-engineered into acetyl-CoAs, which serve as the raw materials for the [[krebs_cycle | Krebs cycle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

During [[glycolysis | glycolysis]], the carbon in glucose gets split in half and becomes oxidized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. This oxidation involves the stripping of some hydrogens and the carbon atoms bonding more strongly with oxygen, implying a gain of electrons by oxygen from carbon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. More oxidation will occur in subsequent processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

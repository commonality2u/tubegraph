[[differential_calculus_and_its_applications | Differential calculus]] focuses on the fundamental question: what is the instantaneous rate of change of something? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a> This concept of instantaneous rates of change is at the core of [[differential_calculus_and_its_applications | differential calculus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Founding Fathers of Calculus

The field of calculus was largely founded by Isaac Newton, a British mathematician and physicist, and Gottfried Leibnitz, a German philosopher and mathematician who was a contemporary of Newton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. They conducted most of their major work in the late 1600s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Newton's original term for [[differential_calculus_and_its_applications | differential calculus]] was "the method of fluxions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Average vs. Instantaneous Rate of Change

The challenge [[differential_calculus_and_its_applications | differential calculus]] addresses is distinct from traditional algebra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. To illustrate, consider plotting Usain Bolt's distance as a function of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>:

*   **Average Speed**: Usain Bolt can travel 100 meters in 9.58 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. His average speed is calculated as the change in distance over the change in time (change in y over change in x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. This is equivalent to the slope of a line connecting two points on a graph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
    *   Change in distance (y) = 100 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>
    *   Change in time (x) = 9.58 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>
    *   Average Speed = 100 meters / 9.58 seconds â‰ˆ 10.4 meters per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. This is approximately 23.5 miles per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

*   **Instantaneous Speed**: Unlike average speed, instantaneous speed asks "How fast is he going right now?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. A runner like Usain Bolt doesn't maintain a constant speed; he accelerates and potentially slows down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Therefore, the plot of distance against time is a curve, not a straight line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. The slope of this curve, representing the rate of change of distance, varies at different moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Usain Bolt's peak instantaneous velocity is closer to 30 miles per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

## The [[Definition of the Derivative | Derivative]]

To find the instantaneous rate of change at a specific point on a curve, one must consider what happens as the change in x (or time) gets smaller and smaller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. This involves taking the limit as the change in x (delta x) approaches zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

$$ \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} $$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>

When this limit is taken, it approaches the instantaneous rate of change, also known as the instantaneous slope at that point on the curve, or the slope of the tangent line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. In [[introduction_to_derivatives_in_calculus | calculus]] terminology, this is called the [[definition_of_the_derivative | derivative]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

The notation for the [[definition_of_the_derivative | derivative]] is `dy/dx` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Here, `dy` is a differential (an infinitely small change in y) and `dx` is a differential (an infinitely small change in x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. By considering these infinitesimally small changes, one can determine the instantaneous slope or speed at a precise moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. It's crucial to take the limit as change in x approaches zero, because dividing by zero would result in an undefined value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

## Concept of Adding Fractions with Same Denominators

When adding fractions that have the same denominator, such as 1/4 plus 1/4, the process is straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

Consider a pie divided into four pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>:
*   If you eat 1/4 of the pie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   And then you eat another 1/4 of the pie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   You will have eaten a total of 2 out of the 4 pieces of the pie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.

Mathematically, this means:
1/4 + 1/4 = 2/4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

This result (2/4) can be [[simplifying_fractions | simplified]] to 1/2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.

### The Rule

When adding fractions with the same denominator:
*   The denominator (the bottom number) remains the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.
*   Only the numerators (the top numbers) are added together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.

For example, to add 2/5 plus 1/5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>:
1.  Check that the denominators are the same (both are 5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.
2.  The denominator of the answer will be 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.
3.  [[basic_arithmetic_operations_in_fraction_addition | Add the numerators]]: 2 + 1 = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.
4.  So, 2/5 + 1/5 = 3/5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

## Subtraction with Same Denominators

[[subtracting_fractions_with_same_denominators | Subtracting fractions with the same denominator]] works in the same way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>:
*   The denominator stays the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.
*   Only the numerators are subtracted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

For example, 3/7 minus 2/7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>:
3/7 - 2/7 = 1/7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.
If you have 3 out of 7 pieces of a pie and give away 2 out of 7 pieces, you are left with 1 out of 7 pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

## Key Terms

*   **Denominator:** The bottom number in a fraction, representing the total number of equal parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.
*   **Numerator:** The top number in a fraction, representing how many parts are being considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.

## Next Steps

When fractions have different denominators, a different approach is required, which involves [[finding_a_common_denominator_for_fractions | finding a common denominator]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.

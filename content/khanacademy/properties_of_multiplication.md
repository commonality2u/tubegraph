[[basic_multiplication_concepts | Multiplication]] is a fundamental arithmetic operation that can be understood by working through examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. An easy way to think about [[basic_multiplication_concepts | multiplication]] is that it is a simple way of doing [[multiplication_as_repeated_addition | addition]] over and over again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## [[multiplication_as_repeated_addition | Multiplication as Repeated Addition]]

When performing [[basic_multiplication_concepts | multiplication]], such as 2 times 3, you are not simply adding 2 to 3 (which equals 5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Instead, [[multiplication as repeated addition | multiplication]] means you add a number to itself a certain number of times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

There are two ways to interpret this for 2 times 3:
*   You can add 2 to itself three times: 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. The number '3' tells you how many 2's to add <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   You can add 3 to itself two times: 3 + 3 = 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. The number '2' tells you how many 3's to add <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

Regardless of which way you interpret the problem, the result is the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. Both 2 + 2 + 2 and 3 + 3 equal 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

## Commutative Property

One interesting property of [[basic_multiplication_concepts | multiplication]] is that the order of the numbers does not change the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. For example, 4 times 3 yields the same result as 3 times 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

Using the concept of [[multiplication_as_repeated_addition | repeated addition]]:
*   "Four 3's" means 3 + 3 + 3 + 3, which equals 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   "Three 4's" means 4 + 4 + 4, which also equals 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

This property is often expressed as "you can switch the order" of the numbers being multiplied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

## [[multiplication_with_1_and_0 | Multiplication with 1]]

When any number is multiplied by 1, the result is that same number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
*   3 times 1 can be seen as "three 1's" (1 + 1 + 1 = 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.
*   Alternatively, it can be seen as "3 one time," which is simply 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

> [!INFO] Identity Property of Multiplication
> Anything multiplied by 1, or 1 multiplied by anything, results in the 'anything' itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
> *   100 times 1 = 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>
> *   1 times 39 = 39 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>
> *   5,493,692 times 1 = 5,493,692 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>

## [[multiplication_with_1_and_0 | Multiplication with 0]]

When any number is multiplied by 0, the result is always 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. This is different from [[multiplication_as_repeated_addition | addition]], where 3 + 0 = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

*   4 times 0 can be interpreted as "0 four times" (0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.
*   It can also be interpreted as "4 zero times," which means there are no 4s present, resulting in nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

> [!INFO] Zero Property of Multiplication
> Any number, no matter how large, multiplied by 0 will always equal 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.
> *   5,493,692 times 0 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>
> *   0 times 17 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>

## [[using_multiplication_to_simplify_counting | Simplifying Counting]]

[[basic_multiplication_concepts | Multiplication]] is particularly useful for [[using_multiplication_to_simplify_counting | simplifying counting]], especially with larger quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

For example, to count lemons arranged in rows:
1.  Count the number of lemons in each row (e.g., 3 lemons per row) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
2.  Count the number of rows (e.g., 4 rows) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
3.  [[basic_multiplication_concepts | Multiply]] the number of lemons per row by the number of rows (e.g., 4 times 3) to find the total (12 lemons) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

While simply counting individual items works for small numbers, [[basic_multiplication_concepts | multiplication]] becomes essential when dealing with large quantities, such as 100 lemons per row and 100 rows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

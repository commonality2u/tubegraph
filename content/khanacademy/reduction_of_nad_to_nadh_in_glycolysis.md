During [[glycolysis | glycolysis]], a crucial biochemical pathway, NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) is reduced to NADH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This reduction process is fundamental for energy production and the continuation of [[glycolysis | glycolysis]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## The Reduction Process
Reduction is defined as the gaining of electrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. In the context of NAD, the NAD+ molecule gains a hydrogen and an electron, losing its positive charge to become NADH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. On a net basis, it can be thought of as gaining a hydride ion (a hydrogen with an extra electron) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This transformation is facilitated by dehydrogenase enzymes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

## Outcomes and Subsequent Use of NADH
For every molecule of glucose broken down, two molecules of NAD are reduced to two molecules of NADH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. These NADH molecules are vital because they can be used later to produce more ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

### Role in Cellular Respiration
NADH can be oxidized in the electron transport chain, a process known as oxidative phosphorylation, to generate a significant amount of ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. This occurs primarily if oxygen is present, allowing the products of [[glycolysis | glycolysis]] to move into the mitochondria for the [[krebs_cycle_and_pyruvate_oxidation | Krebs cycle]] and oxidative phosphorylation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

### Anaerobic Conditions and Fermentation
If oxygen is not available, cells engage in anaerobic respiration or fermentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. In these conditions, the primary goal is to replenish NAD+ from NADH to ensure that [[glycolysis | glycolysis]] can continue producing ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

The [[electron_transport_chain | electron transport chain]] (ETC) is a crucial phase in [[introduction_to_cellular_respiration | cellular respiration]], utilizing the 10 NADHs and 2 FADH2s generated from [[overview_of_glycolysis | glycolysis]] and the [[krebs_cycle | Krebs Cycle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These molecules reside in the matrix of the mitochondria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The primary purpose of the ETC is to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

While the general understanding of the ETC is well-established, some intricate details, such as the exact mechanisms of certain proteins, remain active areas of research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Observations are often based on indirect evidence due to the minuscule scale at which these processes occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## ATP Production

The ETC is highly efficient in producing ATP:
*   Each NADH is indirectly responsible for generating approximately three ATP molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>.
*   Each FADH2 is indirectly responsible for generating approximately two ATP molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>.
    *   FADH2 produces less ATP because its electrons start at a slightly lower energy state compared to NADH's electrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

From the initial 10 NADHs and 2 FADH2s:
*   10 NADH x 3 ATP/NADH = 30 ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>
*   2 FADH2 x 2 ATP/FADH2 = 4 ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>
*   Total ATP from ETC = 34 ATP.

Adding the directly produced ATP from other phases of [[cellular_respiration_phases | cellular respiration]]:
*   2 net ATP from [[overview_of_glycolysis | glycolysis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>
*   2 ATP from the [[krebs_cycle | Krebs Cycle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>
This leads to a theoretical total of 38 ATP molecules produced from one molecule of glucose under ideal conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>. However, in reality, efficiency can vary due to factors like proton leakage or electron energy loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

## Electron Transport and Energy Release

The [[oxidation_and_reduction_processes_in_the_electron_transport_chain | electron transport chain]] begins with the [[oxidation_and_reduction_processes_in_the_electron_transport_chain | oxidation]] of NADH, where it loses two electrons and a proton, forming NAD+ and a proton (H+) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. The NAD+ can then be recycled for use in [[overview_of_glycolysis | glycolysis]] and the [[krebs_cycle | Krebs Cycle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

These high-energy electrons are then transported through a series of "transition molecules" (like coenzyme Q and cytochrome C) within protein complexes embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane (cristae) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. As electrons move from one molecule to the next, they transition to slightly lower energy states, releasing energy in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

The final step of the [[electron_transport_chain | electron transport chain]] involves the [[oxidation_and_reduction_processes_in_the_electron_transport_chain | reduction]] of oxygen. Two electrons combine with two hydrogen protons and an oxygen atom (from half a molecular oxygen) to form water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. This means oxygen acts as the final electron acceptor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

## Proton Pumping and Gradient Formation

The energy released by the falling electrons is harnessed by protein complexes within the mitochondrial inner membrane (cristae) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. These proteins use this energy to actively pump hydrogen protons (H+) from the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space (outer compartment) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

This pumping action creates a proton gradient, where the intermembrane space accumulates a much higher concentration of hydrogen protons than the matrix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. This also means the outer compartment becomes more acidic and positively charged compared to the matrix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. This creates both a concentration gradient and an electrical potential across the inner membrane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

## ATP Synthase and Chemiosmosis

The inner mitochondrial membrane is largely impermeable to protons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. Therefore, the accumulated protons in the intermembrane space must pass back into the matrix through a special protein complex called ATP synthase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

ATP synthase acts like a molecular motor or turbine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. As protons flow down their electrochemical gradient back into the matrix through ATP synthase, they cause a part of the protein (an internal axle-like structure) to spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. This mechanical rotation induces conformational changes in another part of the ATP synthase, which then squeezes ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and an inorganic phosphate group (Pi) together to form ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. This process of [[electron_transport_chain_and_atp_production | ATP production]] driven by a proton gradient is known as chemiosmosis, a key component of [[energy_production_through_cellular_respiration | energy production through cellular respiration]].

ATP synthase is an actual visible protein structure, with a piece that holds its parts relatively stationary while the axle spins to push ADP and phosphate groups together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. This sophisticated mechanism operates in nearly all living systems, including prokaryotes, which perform it on their cellular membranes rather than in mitochondria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.

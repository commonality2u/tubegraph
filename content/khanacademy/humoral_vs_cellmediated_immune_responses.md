The immune system is broadly categorized into two main divisions: the nonspecific (or [[innate_immune_system | innate]]) immune system and the specific (or [[adaptive_immune_system | adaptive]]) immune system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Nonspecific Immune System
The [[innate_immune_system | nonspecific immune system]] acts as a general defense mechanism, not targeting particular pathogens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. It operates on the principle that "this thing looks shady" and needs to be dealt with, regardless of its specific identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

Components of the nonspecific immune system include:
*   **First Line Barriers** These are natural [[barrier_defenses_in_nonspecific_immunity | physical and chemical barriers]] that prevent pathogens from entering the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Examples include:
    *   Skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>
    *   Stomach acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>
    *   Acidity of oils on the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>
*   **Second Line of Defense** Once pathogens bypass the first line, these internal nonspecific responses come into play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>:
    *   [[phagocytes_and_their_role_in_immunity | Phagocytes]]: These are cells that engulf and destroy foreign invaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Examples include dendritic cells, macrophages, and neutrophils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. All [[phagocytes_and_their_role_in_immunity | phagocytes]] are types of white blood cells (leukocytes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
    *   [[immune_system_mechanisms_during_inflammation | Inflammatory response]]: This mechanism helps to bring immune cells and other substances to the site of infection or injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

The [[innate_immune_system | nonspecific immune system]] does not "remember" previous encounters with pathogens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. It acts immediately upon detecting general "shady" characteristics, such as the presence of double-stranded DNA (common in viruses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This type of immune system is found across many species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## Specific (Adaptive) Immune System
The [[adaptive_immune_system | specific immune system]], also known as the [[adaptive_immune_system | adaptive immune system]], is considered a newer adaptation in evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. It is characterized by its ability to recognize and remember specific pathogens, leading to a more targeted and effective response upon re-exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This system is crucial for developing resistance to specific bacteria or viruses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

The main cellular actors in the specific immune system are **lymphocytes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell (leukocyte) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

Lymphocytes are divided into two primary types:
*   **B lymphocytes (B cells)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>:
    *   Historically, B lymphocytes were first recognized in the bursa of Fabricius in birds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
    *   In humans, B lymphocytes are produced and developed in the bone marrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
    *   B lymphocytes are primarily responsible for the **humoral response** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   **T lymphocytes (T cells)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>:
    *   T lymphocytes originate in the bone marrow but mature in the thymus, which is where they get the "T" designation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
    *   T lymphocytes participate in the **cell-mediated response** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
    *   Classes of T lymphocytes include helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Helper T cells play a role in amplifying and activating the humoral response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## Humoral vs. Cell-Mediated Responses

The distinction between the humoral and cell-mediated responses lies in how they combat pathogens.

### Humoral Response
The **humoral response** (primarily involving B cells) targets pathogens that are free-floating in the body's fluids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. The term "humoral" refers to the bodily fluids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

This response is effective against:
*   Viruses that are circulating in the system but have not yet infected cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
*   Bacteria that are floating freely and have not infiltrated cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

### Cell-Mediated Response
The **cell-mediated response** (primarily involving T cells) deals with pathogens that have already infected cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

This response is crucial when:
*   Cells are infected with a virus and are using the cell's machinery to produce more viruses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   Cells have been colonized by bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

In such cases, the cell-mediated response aims to kill the infected cell itself to prevent further spread of the pathogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

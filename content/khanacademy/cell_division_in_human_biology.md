Cell division is a fundamental process in human biology, primarily occurring through two distinct mechanisms: [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]] and [[overview_of_meiosis | meiosis]]. These processes serve different biological purposes, leading to varied outcomes in terms of cell number, chromosome count, and genetic diversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## [[overview_of_mitosis | Mitosis]]

[[overview_of_mitosis | Mitosis]] is the process by which most cells in the human body divide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. It is crucial for growth, development from a single-cell organism, and the repair and replacement of somatic cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, which make up the bulk of the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

### Process and Outcome
The process of [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]] begins with a parent cell that has a diploid (2n) number of chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. For human beings, this means starting with 46 chromosomes, comprising 23 homologous pairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Prior to division, during interphase, the cell grows and replicates its [[dna_replication_process | DNA]] and centrosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

After undergoing [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]] and cytokinesis, the result is two daughter cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Each of these new cells contains the same genetic information and the same diploid number of chromosomes as the original parent cell (2n) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

### Mitotic Cycle
[[overview_of_mitosis | Mitosis]] is considered a cycle. The resulting daughter cells can themselves enter interphase, grow, [[dna_replication_process | replicate their DNA]], and then undergo [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]] again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This continuous process allows for the consistent proliferation of somatic cells.

## [[overview_of_meiosis | Meiosis]]

[[overview_of_meiosis | Meiosis]] is a specialized form of cell division that produces gametes, or sex cells, necessary for [[role_of_meiosis_in_sexual_reproduction | sexual reproduction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. Unlike [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]], [[overview_of_meiosis | meiosis]] is not a cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. The cells produced through [[overview_of_meiosis | meiosis]] are specialized for fertilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

### Process and Outcome
[[overview_of_meiosis | Meiosis]] also starts with a diploid cell (2n), containing 46 chromosomes in humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Like [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]], the cell replicates its [[dna_replication_process | DNA]] during interphase before division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. However, [[overview_of_meiosis | meiosis]] occurs in two distinct phases: Meiosis One and Meiosis Two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

1.  **Meiosis One**: In this first phase, a diploid cell divides into two cells, each of which now has a haploid (n) number of chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. For humans, this means each cell contains 23 chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. This reduction in chromosome number occurs because the homologous pairs of chromosomes are split <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
2.  **Meiosis Two**: Each of the two haploid cells from Meiosis One then undergoes a second division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This phase is similar to [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]] in that the sister chromatids separate, but it starts with haploid cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

The ultimate outcome of [[overview_of_meiosis | meiosis]] is four cells, each containing a haploid (n) number of chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. These resulting cells do not necessarily have identical genetic information due to the random splitting of homologous pairs in Meiosis One <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

### Location and Purpose
[[overview_of_meiosis | Meiosis]] occurs in germ cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. In males, this process takes place in the testes, producing sperm cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. In females, it occurs in the ovaries, producing egg cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. These haploid gametes are designed to fuse during fertilization, forming a fertilized egg (zygote) which can then undergo [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]] to develop into a new organism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Germ cells themselves can also undergo [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]] to produce more germ cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

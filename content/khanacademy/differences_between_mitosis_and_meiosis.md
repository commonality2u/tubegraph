This article details the [[comparison_between_mitosis_and_meiosis | differences between mitosis and meiosis]], building upon general ideas previously discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While a previous video covered [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]], this focuses on the details of [[overview_of_meiosis | meiosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Overview of Mitosis

[[overview_of_mitosis | Mitosis]] begins with a diploid cell and results in two diploid cells, essentially duplicating itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Formally, [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]] is the duplication of the nucleus, which typically concludes with two entire cells through cytokinesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The [[overview_of_mitosis | phases of mitosis]] include prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

[[overview_of_mitosis | Mitosis]] occurs in nearly all of our [[cell_division_in_somatic_and_germ_cells | somatic cells]], such as skin cells, hair cells, and other body tissues, as they replicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Overview of Meiosis

[[overview_of_meiosis | Meiosis]] occurs in [[cell_division_in_somatic_and_germ_cells | germ cells]] and primarily functions to produce gametes for [[role_of_mitosis_and_meiosis_in_human_reproduction | sexual reproduction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. A diploid [[cell_division_in_somatic_and_germ_cells | germ cell]] can undergo [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]] to produce more [[cell_division_in_somatic_and_germ_cells | germ cells]], but for gamete production, it undergoes two rounds of division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

The two rounds of [[overview_of_meiosis | meiosis]] are:
*   **Meiosis I (M1):** In this first round, a diploid cell splits into two haploid cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. If there are 23 pairs of chromosomes, these pairs are split during this stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.
*   **Meiosis II (M2):** The cells from Meiosis I then split further in a mechanism very similar to [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

The end product of [[overview_of_meiosis | meiosis]] is four haploid cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

### Phases of Meiosis

The general [[overview_of_mitosis | phases of mitosis]] (prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase) also exist within each stage of [[overview_of_meiosis | meiosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>:
*   Prophase I, Metaphase I, Anaphase I, Telophase I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>
*   Prophase II, Metaphase II, Anaphase II, Telophase II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>

## Key Differences

### 1. Cell Type and Purpose
*   **[[overview_of_mitosis | Mitosis]]:** Occurs in [[cell_division_in_somatic_and_germ_cells | somatic cells]] for duplication of tissue, skin, hair, etc. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>.
*   **[[overview_of_meiosis | Meiosis]]:** Occurs in [[cell_division_in_somatic_and_germ_cells | germ cells]] to produce gametes for [[role_of_mitosis_and_meiosis_in_human_reproduction | sexual reproduction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

### 2. Starting and Ending Cells
*   **[[overview_of_mitosis | Mitosis]]:** Starts with a diploid cell and ends with two diploid cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **[[overview_of_meiosis | Meiosis]]:** Starts with a diploid cell and ends with four haploid cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

### 3. Number of Divisions
*   **[[overview_of_mitosis | Mitosis]]:** Involves one round of division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **[[overview_of_meiosis | Meiosis]]:** Involves two rounds of division (Meiosis I and Meiosis II) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

### 4. Chromosome Behavior

#### Interphase S-Phase
Both [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]] and [[overview_of_meiosis | meiosis]] are preceded by interphase, during which DNA replication occurs in the S phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. This means that each chromosome replicates to form two sister chromatids, connected by a centromere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>. Centrosomes also duplicate during this time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>.

#### Prophase
*   **[[overview_of_mitosis | Mitosis]] (Prophase):** Chromatin condenses into visible chromosomes, and the nuclear envelope disappears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>.
*   **[[overview_of_meiosis | Meiosis]] (Prophase I):**
    *   The nuclear envelope starts disappearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>.
    *   The chromatin forms into more tightly wound structures of chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:00">[12:36:00]</a>.
    *   A key difference is that [[role_of_homologous_pairs_in_meiosis | homologous pairs]] of chromosomes line up next to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>.
    *   **Crossing Over (Genetic Recombination):** Homologous chromosomes can exchange genetic material at points called chiasmata <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>. This process is organized and exchanges similar genes, leading to new combinations of alleles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>. This is a key feature of [[overview_of_meiosis | meiosis]] that introduces variation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>.

#### Metaphase
*   **[[overview_of_mitosis | Mitosis]] (Metaphase):** Chromosomes align individually along the metaphase plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.
*   **[[overview_of_meiosis | Meiosis]] (Metaphase I):** [[role_of_homologous_pairs_in_meiosis | Homologous pairs]] (each composed of two sister chromatids) align along the metaphase plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a>. The orientation of these pairs is random, further adding to genetic variation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:00">[14:15:00]</a>.
*   **[[overview_of_meiosis | Meiosis]] (Metaphase II):** Chromosomes (each still composed of two sister chromatids) align individually, similar to [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:42:00">[20:42:00]</a>.

#### Anaphase
*   **[[overview_of_mitosis | Mitosis]] (Anaphase):** Sister chromatids separate and move to opposite poles of the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.
*   **[[overview_of_meiosis | Meiosis]] (Anaphase I):** The [[role_of_homologous_pairs_in_meiosis | homologous pairs]] separate and move to opposite poles, but the sister chromatids remain attached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:08:00">[15:08:00]</a>. This is a key distinguishing difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:23:00">[16:23:00]</a>.
*   **[[overview_of_meiosis | Meiosis]] (Anaphase II):** Sister chromatids finally separate and move to opposite poles, similar to [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:17:00">[22:17:00]</a>.

#### Telophase
*   **[[overview_of_mitosis | Mitosis]] (Telophase):** Two new nuclei form, and cytokinesis divides the cytoplasm, resulting in two identical diploid cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.
*   **[[overview_of_meiosis | Meiosis]] (Telophase I):** Two haploid cells are formed, each containing chromosomes that still consist of two sister chromatids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:48:00">[16:48:00]</a>. Nuclear envelopes may reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:42:00">[17:42:00]</a>.
*   **[[overview_of_meiosis | Meiosis]] (Telophase II):** Four haploid cells are formed, each with single, unreplicated chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:49:00">[24:49:00]</a>. Nuclear membranes reform around these chromosomes, and cytokinesis completes the division into four distinct gametes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:15:00">[25:15:00]</a>.

### 5. Genetic Variation
*   **[[overview_of_mitosis | Mitosis]]:** Produces genetically identical daughter cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.
*   **[[overview_of_meiosis | Meiosis]]:** Produces genetically diverse haploid cells (gametes) due to:
    *   **Crossing Over:** Exchange of genetic material between [[role_of_homologous_pairs_in_meiosis | homologous chromosomes]] during Prophase I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>.
    *   **Independent Assortment:** Random alignment of [[role_of_homologous_pairs_in_meiosis | homologous pairs]] during Metaphase I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:00">[14:15:00]</a>.

In summary, the first stage of [[overview_of_meiosis | meiosis]] splits [[role_of_homologous_pairs_in_meiosis | homologous pairs]] with genetic recombination, while the second stage separates sister chromatids, similar to [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:52:00">[26:52:00]</a>. This entire process leads to significant variation in the gene pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:01:00">[27:01:00]</a>.

The processes of [[Process and phases of mitosis | mitosis]] and [[Process and phases of meiosis | meiosis]] are fundamental to cell division, but they serve distinct purposes and result in different genetic outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Mitosis Overview
[[Process and phases of mitosis | Mitosis]] is the process where a diploid cell duplicates itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. It begins with a diploid cell and results in two diploid cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Formally, [[Process and phases of mitosis | mitosis]] is the duplication of the nucleus, which typically leads to two entire cells through a process called cytokinesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

[[Process and phases of mitosis | Mitosis]] occurs in nearly all somatic cells, such as skin cells, hair cells, and other body tissues as they replicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The [[Process and phases of mitosis | phases of mitosis]] include prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Meiosis Overview
[[Process and phases of meiosis | Meiosis]] takes place in germ cells and is primarily used to produce gametes for [[Role of meiosis in sexual reproduction | sexual reproduction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Starting with a diploid germ cell, [[Process and phases of meiosis | meiosis]] involves two rounds of division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

The first round, [[Phases of meiosis | Meiosis I]], sees the diploid cell split into two haploid cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. For example, if a cell starts with 23 pairs of chromosomes, [[Phases of meiosis | Meiosis I]] splits these pairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. The second round, [[Phases of meiosis | Meiosis II]], then splits these haploid cells further in a mechanism very similar to [[Process and phases of mitosis | mitosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. The end result of [[Process and phases of meiosis | meiosis]] is four haploid cells, known as gametes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Key Differences in Cell Division

The primary [[Differences in genetic outcomes between mitosis and meiosis | differences in genetic outcomes between mitosis and meiosis]] arise from their distinct processes and purposes.

### Preparatory Phase (Interphase)
Before either [[Process and phases of mitosis | mitosis]] or [[Process and phases of meiosis | meiosis]] begins, cells spend most of their time in interphase, performing normal cell functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. A key event during the S phase of interphase for both processes is the replication of DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Chromosomes, normally unwound as chromatin, condense and replicate during this phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Additionally, centrosomes, which help organize microtubules, also replicate during interphase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

### Phasing and Rounds of Division
Both [[Process and phases of mitosis | mitosis]] and [[Process and phases of meiosis | meiosis]] utilize phases named prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. However:
*   **Mitosis** involves a single set of these phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   **Meiosis** involves two complete sets: [[Phases of meiosis | Prophase I]], [[Phases of meiosis | Metaphase I]], [[Phases of meiosis | Anaphase I]], [[Phases of meiosis | Telophase I]], followed by [[Phases of meiosis | Prophase II]], [[Phases of meiosis | Metaphase II]], [[Phases of meiosis | Anaphase II]], and [[Phases of meiosis | Telophase II]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

### Behavior of Homologous Chromosomes

[[Detailed cell division process in meiosis | Meiosis I]] introduces significant differences compared to [[Process and phases of mitosis | mitosis]]:

#### Prophase I (Meiosis) vs. Prophase (Mitosis)
*   **Nuclear Envelope:** In both prophases, the nuclear envelope begins to disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Chromosomes condense from chromatin into tighter structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
*   **Homologous Pairing:** A unique feature of [[Detailed cell division process in meiosis | Prophase I]] in [[Process and phases of meiosis | meiosis]] is the alignment of homologous pairs of chromosomes next to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>, forming a tetrad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. This does not typically happen in [[Process and phases of mitosis | mitosis]].
*   **Genetic Recombination (Crossing Over):** Within these homologous pairs, genetic recombination (crossing over) can occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. This is where segments of DNA are exchanged between homologous chromosomes at points called chiasmata <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. This process generates new combinations of alleles, contributing significantly to [[Differences in genetic outcomes between mitosis and meiosis | genetic variation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. This key feature is absent in [[Process and phases of mitosis | mitosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.

#### Metaphase I (Meiosis) vs. Metaphase (Mitosis)
*   In [[Phases of meiosis | Metaphase I]], the homologous pairs align at the metaphase plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. The orientation of these pairs is random, further adding to [[Differences in genetic outcomes between mitosis and meiosis | genetic variation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.
*   In [[Process and phases of mitosis | mitosis]]'s metaphase, individual replicated chromosomes (sister chromatids) align at the metaphase plate.

#### Anaphase I (Meiosis) vs. Anaphase (Mitosis)
*   **Anaphase I:** In [[Detailed cell division process in meiosis | Anaphase I]] of [[Process and phases of meiosis | meiosis]], the homologous chromosomes separate and are pulled to opposite poles of the cell, but the sister chromatids remain attached at their centromeres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. This is a crucial distinction.
*   **Anaphase (Mitosis):** In [[Process and phases of mitosis | mitosis]]'s anaphase, the sister chromatids themselves separate and are pulled to opposite poles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

### Meiosis II: Similar to Mitosis

After [[Detailed cell division process in meiosis | Meiosis I]] concludes with telophase I and cytokinesis, forming two haploid cells, these cells then proceed into [[Phases of meiosis | Meiosis II]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>. [[Phases of meiosis | Meiosis II]] is very similar to [[Process and phases of mitosis | mitosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>:
*   **Prophase II:** The nuclear envelope (if re-formed) disintegrates, and centrosomes migrate to opposite poles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>.
*   **Metaphase II:** Chromosomes (each still composed of two sister chromatids) align at the metaphase plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>.
*   **Anaphase II:** Sister chromatids separate and move to opposite poles, now considered individual chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>.
*   **Telophase II:** Nuclear envelopes reform around the separated chromosomes at each pole, and cytokinesis divides the cytoplasm, resulting in a total of four haploid cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>.

The process of [[Process and phases of meiosis | meiosis]], particularly its first stage, ensures the creation of genetically diverse gametes, which is essential for [[Role of meiosis in sexual reproduction | sexual reproduction]] and introducing [[Differences in genetic outcomes between mitosis and meiosis | variation]] into a population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>.

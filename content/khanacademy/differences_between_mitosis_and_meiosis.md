[[Overview of mitosis and meiosis | Mitosis]] and [[Overview of meiosis | meiosis]] are fundamental processes of cell division, but they serve different purposes and have distinct outcomes. While both involve the duplication of genetic material and subsequent cell division, their key differences lie in the number of divisions, the type of cells they affect, and the genetic makeup of their resulting daughter cells.

## Overview of Mitosis

[[Overview of mitosis | Mitosis]] is a process where a single diploid cell divides into two identical diploid daughter cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. It essentially duplicates itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Formally, [[Overview of mitosis | mitosis]] is the duplication of the nucleus, which normally results in two entire cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This process includes cytokinesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

[[Overview of mitosis | Mitosis]] occurs in almost all somatic cells in the body, such as skin cells, hair cells, and other tissues, as they replicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The phases of [[Overview of mitosis | mitosis]] include prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. A key event during the S phase of interphase, before [[Overview of mitosis | mitosis]] or [[Overview of meiosis | meiosis]], is the replication of DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. In [[Overview of mitosis | mitosis]], the sister chromatids separate during anaphase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

## Overview of Meiosis

[[Overview of meiosis | Meiosis]] occurs in germ cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a> and is primarily used to produce gametes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, which facilitate [[Role of meiosis in sexual reproduction | sexual reproduction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Starting with a diploid germ cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, [[Overview of meiosis | meiosis]] involves two rounds of division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>: [[Stages and process of meiosis | Meiosis I]] and [[Stages and process of meiosis | Meiosis II]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. The end product of [[Overview of meiosis | meiosis]] is four haploid cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, known as gametes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>.

## Key Differences

The primary distinctions between [[Overview of mitosis | mitosis]] and [[Overview of meiosis | meiosis]] are summarized below:

### Number of Divisions and Outcome
*   **[[Overview of mitosis | Mitosis]]**: Involves one round of division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. A diploid cell produces two diploid daughter cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The chromosome number is preserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   **[[Overview of meiosis | Meiosis]]**: Involves two distinct rounds of division, [[Stages and process of meiosis | Meiosis I]] and [[Stages and process of meiosis | Meiosis II]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. A diploid cell produces four haploid cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, each with half the number of chromosomes of the original diploid cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>.

### Location and Purpose
*   **[[Overview of mitosis | Mitosis]]**: Occurs in somatic cells for growth, repair, and asexual reproduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   **[[Overview of meiosis | Meiosis]]**: Occurs in germ cells to produce gametes for [[Role of meiosis in sexual reproduction | sexual reproduction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### Genetic Variation
*   **[[Overview of mitosis | Mitosis]]**: Produces genetically identical daughter cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   **[[Overview of meiosis | Meiosis]]**: Introduces [[Genetic variation through meiotic processes | genetic variation]] through two key mechanisms:
    *   **Crossing Over (Prophase I)**: Homologous chromosomes exchange genetic material, leading to [[Genetic variation through meiotic processes | genetic recombination]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. This organized process ensures the exchange of similar genes but different alleles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
    *   **Independent Assortment (Metaphase I)**: The random alignment of homologous pairs at the metaphase plate ensures that the resulting haploid cells receive a unique combination of paternal and maternal chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

### Chromosome Behavior in Anaphase
*   **Anaphase (Mitosis)**: Sister chromatids separate and move to opposite poles of the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.
*   **Anaphase I (Meiosis)**: Homologous chromosomes separate and move to opposite poles, but sister chromatids remain attached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.
*   **Anaphase II (Meiosis)**: Sister chromatids finally separate and move to opposite poles, similar to anaphase in [[Overview of mitosis | mitosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>.

### Phases
Both processes share similar phases (prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase), but [[Overview of meiosis | meiosis]] repeats these phases twice, designated with 'I' and 'II' (e.g., [[Stages and process of meiosis | Prophase I]], [[Stages and process of meiosis | Metaphase I]], [[Stages and process of meiosis | Anaphase I]], [[Stages and process of meiosis | Telophase I]], and then [[Stages and process of meiosis | Prophase II]], etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. The events within [[Stages and process of meiosis | Meiosis I]] (especially Prophase I and Anaphase I) are distinct from [[Overview of mitosis | mitosis]]. [[Stages and process of meiosis | Meiosis II]] is very similar to [[Overview of mitosis | mitosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

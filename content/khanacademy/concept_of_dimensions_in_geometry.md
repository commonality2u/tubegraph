[[introduction_to_geometry_terminology | Geometry]] is the study and understanding of how shapes, space, and things we see relate to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54"></a>. The word "geometry" itself originates from "geo" (referring to the earth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17"></a> and "metry" (meaning measurement) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32"></a>, essentially translating to "earth measurement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47"></a>. This field encapsulates various visual mathematical concepts, including [[line_segments_rays_and_lines_in_geometry | lines]], triangles, circles, angles, patterns, and three-dimensional shapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08"></a>.

## Zero Dimensions: The Point
A point is defined as a simple dot, specifying only a position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40"></a>.

> A point is just a position where you cannot move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05"></a>. If you move in any direction, you are no longer at that point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10"></a>.

A point has zero dimensions because there are no options to travel within it (no movement up, down, left, right, in, or out) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33"></a>. Points are typically labeled with letters, such as Point A, Point B, Point C, or Point D, to differentiate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40"></a>.

## One Dimension: [[line_segments_rays_and_lines_in_geometry | Line Segments]], [[line_segments_rays_and_lines_in_geometry | Rays]], and [[line_segments_rays_and_lines_in_geometry | Lines]]

### [[line_segments_rays_and_lines_in_geometry | Line Segment]]
A [[line_segments_rays_and_lines_in_geometry | line segment]] consists of all points connecting two specific points along a straight path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14"></a>. These two specific points are called "endpoints" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09"></a>.

> Endpoints are the start and end points of a [[line_segments_rays_and_lines_in_geometry | line segment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19"></a>.

A [[line_segments_rays_and_lines_in_geometry | line segment]] is a one-dimensional object because you can only move back and forth along its length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50"></a>. It has no width and only possesses length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28"></a>. The length of a [[line_segments_rays_and_lines_in_geometry | line segment]] is denoted by writing its endpoints without the line symbol above (e.g., AB = five units) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02"></a>.
Line segments are referred to by their endpoints with a line drawn above them (e.g., $\overline{AB}$ or $\overline{BA}$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49"></a>.

### [[line_segments_rays_and_lines_in_geometry | Ray]]
A [[line_segments_rays_and_lines_in_geometry | ray]] starts at one point (called the vertex) and extends infinitely in one direction past another point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24"></a>. Like a [[line_segments_rays_and_lines_in_geometry | line segment]], a [[line_segments_rays_and_lines_in_geometry | ray]] is one-dimensional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07"></a>. It is denoted by its starting point and another point it passes through, with an arrow indicating the direction of infinite extension (e.g., $\overrightarrow{AD}$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15"></a>. The order of letters matters for [[line_segments_rays_and_lines_in_geometry | rays]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24"></a>.

### [[line_segments_rays_and_lines_in_geometry | Line]]
In [[introduction_to_geometry_terminology | geometry]], a [[line_segments_rays_and_lines_in_geometry | line]] extends infinitely in both directions through two given points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00"></a>. Unlike a [[line_segments_rays_and_lines_in_geometry | line segment]], a [[line_segments_rays_and_lines_in_geometry | line]] never ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11"></a>. It is denoted by two points on the [[line_segments_rays_and_lines_in_geometry | line]] with arrows over them indicating infinite extension in both directions (e.g., $\overleftrightarrow{EF}$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23"></a>.

### Collinear Points and Midpoint
Points are considered **collinear** if they all lie on the same [[line_segments_rays_and_lines_in_geometry | line]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21"></a>.
A **midpoint** (e.g., Z) of a [[line_segments_rays_and_lines_in_geometry | line segment]] (e.g., XY) is a point that is exactly halfway between its two endpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09"></a>. This means the [[concept_of_distance_and_displacement | distance]] from one endpoint to the midpoint is the same as the [[concept_of_distance_and_displacement | distance]] from the midpoint to the other endpoint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52"></a>.

## Two Dimensions: The Plane
To have two dimensions means movement is possible backward and forward in two different directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33"></a>. A flat surface, like a screen or a piece of paper, is a two-dimensional object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37"></a>. You can move left/right and up/down on such a surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44"></a>.
Geometrically, a **plane** is an idea of a flat surface that extends infinitely in every direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00"></a>. A physical piece of paper could be considered a "plane segment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22"></a>.

## Three Dimensions and Beyond
Three-dimensional space allows for movement in three independent directions: left/right, up/down, and in/out of the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28"></a>. While difficult to visualize, higher mathematics can study concepts with more than three dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47"></a>.

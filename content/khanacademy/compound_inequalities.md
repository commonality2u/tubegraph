[[Absolute value inequalities | Absolute value inequalities]], particularly [[solving_inequalities_with_absolute_values | solving inequalities with absolute values]], often result in compound inequalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While this topic can be confusing, understanding the meaning of absolute value helps simplify it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Absolute Value and Compound Inequalities

The absolute value of a number represents its distance from zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This understanding is key to converting [[absolute_value_inequalities | absolute value inequalities]] into compound inequalities. It is beneficial to visualize solutions on a number line rather than memorizing rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### Case 1: Absolute Value Less Than a Number

When an absolute value is *less than* a certain number (e.g., `|x| < 12`), it means that the expression inside the absolute value must be less than that number *away from zero* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

Consider the example: `|x| < 12` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
This translates to: "What are all the `x`'s that are less than 12 away from 0?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

On a number line, numbers less than 12 away from zero fall between -12 and 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   This means `x` must be greater than -12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **AND** `x` must be less than 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

This forms a compound inequality with an "and" condition: `-12 < x < 12` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
The solution set in interval notation is (-12, 12) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

Another example: `|5x + 3| < 7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.
*   The expression `5x + 3` must be less than 7 away from zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
*   This means `5x + 3` must be greater than -7 **and** less than 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

This translates to the compound inequality: `-7 < 5x + 3 < 7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
To solve:
1.  Subtract 3 from all parts: `-7 - 3 < 5x < 7 - 3` → `-10 < 5x < 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
2.  Divide all parts by 5: `-10/5 < x < 4/5` → `-2 < x < 4/5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
The solution set is `x` greater than -2 and less than 4/5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

### Case 2: Absolute Value Greater Than a Number

When an absolute value is *greater than* a certain number (e.g., `|7x| >= 21`), it means that the expression inside the absolute value must be 21 or more away from zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

Consider the example: `|7x| >= 21` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
On a number line, numbers 21 or more away from zero are those greater than or equal to 21, or less than or equal to -21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   This means `7x` needs to be less than or equal to -21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   **OR** `7x` needs to be greater than or equal to 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

This forms a [[compound_inequality_with_multiple_conditions | compound inequality]] with an "or" condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
To solve:
1.  Solve `7x <= -21`: Divide by 7 to get `x <= -3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
2.  Solve `7x >= 21`: Divide by 7 to get `x >= 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
The solution set is `x <= -3` **OR** `x >= 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

Another example: `|2x/7 + 9| > 5/7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
*   The expression `2x/7 + 9` must be more than 5/7 away from zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
*   This means `2x/7 + 9` is greater than 5/7 **OR** `2x/7 + 9` is less than -5/7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

Solve each part:
1.  `2x/7 + 9 > 5/7`
    *   Multiply by 7: `2x + 63 > 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>
    *   Subtract 63: `2x > -58` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>
    *   Divide by 2: `x > -29` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>
2.  `2x/7 + 9 < -5/7`
    *   Multiply by 7: `2x + 63 < -5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>
    *   Subtract 63: `2x < -68` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>
    *   Divide by 2: `x < -34` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>
The solution set is `x > -29` **OR** `x < -34` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.

## General Rules for Absolute Value Inequalities

While visualization is preferred, these general rules convert [[absolute_value_inequalities | absolute value inequalities]] into compound inequalities:

*   If `|f(x)| < a` (where `a` is a positive number), then `f(x)` must be greater than `-a` **and** less than `a` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
    *   This is written as: `-a < f(x) < a` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   If `|f(x)| > a` (where `a` is a positive number), then `f(x)` must be greater than `a` **or** less than `-a` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
    *   This is written as: `f(x) > a` **OR** `f(x) < -a` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

Understanding that the first case means "less than `a` away from 0" and the second means "more than `a` away from 0" helps reinforce the logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

## Converting Fractions to Decimals

The method for converting any fraction to a decimal involves taking the denominator and dividing it into the numerator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This process often requires adding a decimal point and trailing zeros to the numerator to facilitate the division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Examples

#### Example 1: 1/2
To convert 1/2 to a decimal:
1.  Divide the denominator (2) into the numerator (1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
2.  Add a decimal point and trailing zeros to 1, making it 1.0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
3.  Place the decimal point in the quotient directly above the decimal point in the dividend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
4.  2 goes into 10 five times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
5.  5 multiplied by 2 is 10, leaving a remainder of 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
    *   Therefore, 1/2 is equal to 0.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

#### Example 2: 1/3
To convert 1/3 to a decimal:
1.  Divide the denominator (3) into the numerator (1), adding trailing zeros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
2.  3 does not go into 1, so consider 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
3.  3 goes into 10 three times (3 x 3 = 9) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
4.  Subtracting 9 from 10 leaves 1, and bringing down another zero forms 10 again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
5.  This process continues indefinitely, resulting in a repeating pattern of threes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
    *   1/3 is equal to 0.3333... and it goes on forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

[[understanding_repeating_decimals | Repeating decimals]] are represented by placing a line over the repeating digit(s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. For example, 0.333... can be written as 0.3 repeating or 0.33 repeating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

#### Example 3: 17/9 (Improper Fraction)
When the numerator is larger than the denominator (an [[converting_improper_fractions_to_mixed_numbers | improper fraction]]), the decimal will be greater than 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
1.  Divide 9 into 17, adding trailing zeros for the decimal part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
2.  9 goes into 17 one time (1 x 9 = 9) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
3.  17 minus 9 is 8; bring down a 0 to make it 80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
4.  9 goes into 80 eight times (8 x 9 = 72) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
5.  Subtracting 72 from 80 leaves 8, and bringing down another 0 again forms 80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
6.  This also forms a repeating pattern.
    *   17/9 is equal to 1.888... where the 8 repeats indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
    *   This can be written as 1.8 repeating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
    *   If [[approximating_decimals_during_conversion | approximating decimals during conversion]] is required, it could be rounded to roughly 1.89 (to the hundredths place) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

#### Example 4: 17/93
1.  Set up the division of 93 into 17, adding multiple trailing zeros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
2.  93 goes into 17 zero times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
3.  93 goes into 170 one time (1 x 93 = 93) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
4.  Subtracting 93 from 170 leaves 77; bring down a 0 to make 770 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
5.  93 goes into 770 approximately eight times (8 x 93 = 744) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
6.  Subtracting 744 from 770 leaves 26; bring down a 0 to make 260 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
7.  93 goes into 260 approximately two times (2 x 93 = 186) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
    *   This process can continue indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
    *   An approximation of 17/93 is 0.182 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
    *   On an exam, you would likely be told to round to a specific decimal place, such as the hundredths or thousandths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

## Converting Decimals to Fractions

Converting decimals to fractions is generally simpler.
1.  Identify the place value of the last significant digit in the decimal.
2.  Write the decimal digits as the numerator.
3.  Use the identified place value (e.g., tenths, hundredths, thousandths) as the denominator.

### Examples

#### Example 1: 0.035
1.  The last significant digit (5) is in the thousandths place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
2.  The number formed by the digits is 35.
3.  Write 35 over 1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
    *   So, 0.035 = 35/1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
4.  To [[simplifying_fractions | simplify fractions]] to their simplest form, divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor. In this case, both are divisible by 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
    *   35 รท 5 = 7
    *   1,000 รท 5 = 200
    *   Thus, 0.035 simplifies to 7/200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

#### Example 2: 0.030 and 0.03
1.  For 0.030, the last significant digit (0) is in the thousandths place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
2.  This can be written as 30/1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
3.  Alternatively, 0.030 is equivalent to 0.03, as the trailing zero does not add value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
4.  For 0.03, the last significant digit (3) is in the hundredths place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
5.  This converts to 3/100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
6.  Both 30/1,000 and 3/100 are equivalent; dividing both the numerator and denominator of 30/1,000 by 10 yields 3/100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

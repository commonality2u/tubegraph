To convert a fraction into a decimal, a consistent method involves dividing the fraction's denominator into its numerator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This method is universally applicable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Method Steps

1.  **Set up the Division**: Place the denominator as the divisor and the numerator as the dividend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
2.  **Add Decimals and Zeros**: If the denominator is larger than the numerator (meaning the result will be less than 1), add a decimal point and several trailing zeros to the numerator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This does not change the number's value but allows for decimal precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
3.  **Perform Long Division**: Continue the division process until the remainder is zero or a repeating pattern is identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Examples

### Example 1: Converting 1/2 to a Decimal

To convert 1/2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>:
Divide 2 (denominator) into 1 (numerator) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
1.  Add a decimal point and a trailing zero to 1, making it 1.0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
2.  2 goes into 10 five times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
3.  5 times 2 is 10, with a remainder of 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
Therefore, 1/2 is equal to 0.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### Example 2: Converting 1/3 to a Decimal (Repeating Decimal)

To convert 1/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>:
Divide 3 (denominator) into 1 (numerator) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
1.  Add a decimal point and trailing zeros to 1, making it 1.000... <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
2.  3 goes into 10 three times (3 x 3 = 9), with a remainder of 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
3.  Bring down another zero, making it 10 again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
This process continues indefinitely, resulting in a repeating pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
1/3 is equal to 0.3333... <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

#### Representing Repeating Decimals
When a decimal pattern repeats indefinitely, it is called a [[Repeating decimals as rational numbers | repeating decimal]]. This can be represented by drawing a line (or bar) over the repeating digits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. For 1/3, this is written as 0.33 repeating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

### Example 3: Converting 17/9 to a Decimal (Improper Fraction)

This is an [[Working with improper fractions | improper fraction]] because the numerator (17) is larger than the denominator (9) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This means the resulting decimal will be greater than 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
Divide 9 into 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
1.  9 goes into 17 one time (1 x 9 = 9), with a remainder of 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
2.  Add a decimal point to the quotient and numerator (17.000...) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
3.  Bring down a zero to make it 80. 9 goes into 80 eight times (8 x 9 = 72), with a remainder of 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
4.  This pattern of getting an 8 remainder and bringing down a zero will continue indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
So, 17/9 is equal to 1.88, where the 0.88 part repeats forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Rounding
> For repeating decimals, it's possible to round the number to a specific decimal place, such as to the hundredths place (e.g., 1.89 for 1.88 repeating) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. However, the repeating decimal notation is the exact answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

### Example 4: Converting 17/93 to a Decimal

Divide 93 (denominator) into 17 (numerator) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
1.  93 goes into 17 zero times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. Add a decimal point and trailing zeros to 17.
2.  93 goes into 170 one time (1 x 93 = 93), remainder 77 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
3.  Bring down a zero to make it 770. 93 goes into 770 eight times (8 x 93 = 744), remainder 26 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
4.  Bring down another zero to make it 260. 93 goes into 260 two times (2 x 93 = 186), remainder 74 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
This process could continue indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
An approximation for 17/93 would be 0.182, with more decimals possible if continued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. On an exam, you might be asked to round to a specific place, like the hundredths or thousandths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

## Converting Decimals to Fractions

Converting decimals to fractions is generally simpler than the reverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. This process is covered in more detail in [[converting_decimals_to_fractions | Converting Decimals to Fractions]].
For example, to convert 0.035 to a fraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>:
1.  Identify the place value of the last digit. In 0.035, the 5 is in the thousandths place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
2.  Write the number after the decimal point as the numerator, and the corresponding place value (e.g., 10, 100, 1000) as the denominator. So, 0.035 is 35/1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
3.  [[Simplifying fractions | Simplify the fraction]] to its simplest form by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. For 35/1,000, both can be divided by 5, resulting in 7/200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
The resulting fraction is a [[Simplifying fractional representations | simplified fractional representation]].

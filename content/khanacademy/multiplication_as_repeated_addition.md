[[basic_multiplication_concepts | Multiplication]] is a mathematical operation that can be understood as a simplified way of performing [[commutative_property_of_addition | addition]] repeatedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. This concept simplifies the process of adding the same number multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.

## Understanding Multiplication

To grasp [[basic_multiplication_concepts | multiplication]], it's helpful to compare it with addition:

### Addition Review
For example, 2 plus 3 (2 + 3) equals 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. This can be visualized as combining 2 items with 3 items to get a total of 5 items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. Alternatively, on a [[number_line_for_addition | number line]], starting at 2 and moving 3 spaces to the right leads to 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

### Multiplication as Repeated Addition
Consider the expression 2 times 3 (2 x 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. This means adding the number 2 to itself three times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>:
```
2 + 2 + 2 = 6
```
The "3" in "2 times 3" indicates how many times the number 2 should be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

### Commutative Property of Multiplication
An interesting aspect of multiplication is that the order of the numbers does not change the result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. This is known as one of the [[properties_of_multiplication | properties of multiplication]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. So, 2 times 3 can also be interpreted as adding the number 3 to itself two times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>:
```
3 + 3 = 6
```
Both interpretations yield the same answer, 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>. In some systems, this is phrased as "four 3's" (4 x 3) or "three 4's" (3 x 4), which can be more intuitive for understanding the repeated addition concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>.

## [[using_multiplication_to_simplify_counting | Using Multiplication to Simplify Counting]]

[[using_multiplication_to_simplify_counting | Multiplication]] is particularly useful for efficiently counting items arranged in a grid or array <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.

Consider an arrangement of lemons:
```
üçã üçã üçã
üçã üçã üçã
üçã üçã üçã
üçã üçã üçã
```
By direct counting, there are 12 lemons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>.
Using multiplication, we can count the lemons more quickly:
*   There are 3 lemons in each row <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>.
*   There are 4 rows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>.
Therefore, the total number of lemons is 4 times 3 (4 x 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>.
As repeated addition:
```
3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12
```
Or, by applying the [[properties_of_multiplication | commutative property]], it can be 3 times 4 (3 x 4):
```
4 + 4 + 4 = 12
```
While direct counting might seem faster for small numbers, [[using_multiplication_to_simplify_counting | multiplication]] becomes invaluable for larger quantities, such as 100 lemons in 100 rows, where repeated addition would be impractical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>.

## [[multiplication_with_1_and_0 | Special Cases of Multiplication]]

### Multiplying by 1
When any number is multiplied by 1, the result is that same number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[00:59:00]</a>.
*   3 times 1 (3 x 1) means "three 1's" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>:
    ```
    1 + 1 + 1 = 3
    ```
*   Alternatively, it can be seen as "3 one time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>, which is simply 3.
Examples:
*   100 x 1 = 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>
*   1 x 39 = 39 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>

### Multiplying by 0
Any number multiplied by 0 results in 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>.
*   4 times 0 (4 x 0) means "four 0's" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:00">[11:59:00]</a>:
    ```
    0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0
    ```
*   Or, it can be viewed as "4 zero times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:00">[12:15:00]</a>, meaning the number 4 appears zero times, resulting in nothing.
Examples:
*   5,493,692 x 0 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>
*   0 x 17 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:00">[13:07:00]</a>

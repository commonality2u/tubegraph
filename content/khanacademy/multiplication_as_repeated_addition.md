[[basics_of_multiplication | Multiplication]] is fundamentally a simplified way of performing [[understanding_multiplication_using_examples | addition]] repeatedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. It allows for efficient counting, especially when dealing with larger quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

## Understanding the Concept

To grasp [[visualizing_multiplication_in_equations | multiplication]], it's helpful to compare it to [[understanding_multiplication_using_examples | addition]].

For example, `2 + 3` equals `5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This can be visualized by combining two items with three other items, resulting in a total of five items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. On a number line, starting at `2` and moving `3` spaces to the right also leads to `5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

Now, consider `2 times 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This operation can be interpreted in two ways:

1.  **Adding the first number to itself the number of times indicated by the second number**:
    *   `2 times 3` means `2` added to itself three times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
    *   This is written as `2 + 2 + 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
    *   Calculating this: `2 + 2 = 4`, and `4 + 2 = 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

2.  **Adding the second number to itself the number of times indicated by the first number**:
    *   `2 times 3` can also mean `3` added to itself two times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
    *   This is written as `3 + 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
    *   Calculating this: `3 + 3 = 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

Notice that both interpretations yield the same answer (`6`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. This property, where changing the order of the numbers in [[basics_of_multiplication | multiplication]] does not change the result, is similar to the [[commutative_property_of_addition | commutative property of addition]] and is a key characteristic of multiplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

## Practical Utility: Counting Lemons

[[importance_and_utility_of_multiplication | Multiplication]] is useful for simplifying counting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

Consider a grid of lemons:
```
üçã üçã üçã
üçã üçã üçã
üçã üçã üçã
üçã üçã üçã
```

By direct counting, there are `12` lemons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

Using multiplication, we can count more efficiently:
*   There are `3` lemons in each row <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   There are `4` rows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

Therefore, the total number of lemons can be found by `4 times 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.
This can be expressed as:
*   `3 + 3 + 3 + 3` (four `3`s) = `12` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   Or, `4 + 4 + 4` (three `4`s) = `12` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

While this example might seem easily counted directly, the power of [[basics_of_multiplication | multiplication]] becomes evident with larger numbers, such as `100` lemons per row and `100` rows, where direct counting would be impractical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

## Special Cases

### Multiplying by One

Multiplying any number by `1` results in the original number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
For example, `3 times 1`:
*   Can be interpreted as three `1`s: `1 + 1 + 1 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.
*   Can also be interpreted as `3` taken one time: `3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

So, `3 times 1 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. This holds true for any number, e.g., `100 times 1 = 100` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a> or `1 times 39 = 39` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

### Multiplying by Zero

Multiplying any number by `0` results in `0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.
For example, `4 times 0`:
*   Can be interpreted as four `0`s: `0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.
*   Can also be interpreted as `4` taken zero times, meaning no `4`s at all, which is `0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

Thus, a large number like `5,493,692 times 0` also equals `0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

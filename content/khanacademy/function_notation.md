<h2>Function Notation</h2>

Function notation is a powerful and general tool used to describe relationships between inputs and outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

<blockquote>
A function is defined as something that takes an input, processes it, and then produces a single, given output based on that input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. For any specific input, there can only be one possible output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

<h3>Standard Notation</h3>
The most common way to denote a function is `f(x)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   `x` is typically used as the variable for the input into the function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   `f` is frequently used as the name of the function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   Both the input variable and the function name can be represented by other letters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   The variable acts as a placeholder; to evaluate the function, you replace the placeholder with the specific input value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

<h3>Examples of Function Notation</h3>

<h4>Piecewise Function Example</h4>
Consider a function `f(x)` defined as:
*   `f(x) = x^2` if `x` is even <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>
*   `f(x) = x + 5` if `x` is odd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>

To evaluate this function for specific inputs:
*   **Evaluating `f(2)`:**
    *   Since 2 is an even number, we use the first rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
    *   `f(2) = 2^2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
    *   `f(2) = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **Evaluating `f(3)`:**
    *   Since 3 is an odd number, we use the second rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
    *   `f(3) = 3 + 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
    *   `f(3) = 8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

<h4>Abstract Function Example</h4>
Functions can be defined in very abstract ways, not just with traditional [[mathematical_expressions | mathematical expressions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
Let's define a function `h(a)` as:
*   `h(a)` is the next largest number that starts with the same letter as variable `a` (assuming numbers are spelled out in English) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

To evaluate `h(a)`:
*   **Evaluating `h(2)`:**
    *   "2" starts with 'T' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
    *   The next largest number starting with 'T' is "3" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
    *   So, `h(2) = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **Evaluating `h(8)`:**
    *   "8" starts with 'E' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
    *   The next largest number starting with 'E' is "11" (not "9" or "10") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
    *   So, `h(8) = 11` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

<h4>Relating to Traditional Equations</h4>
You may have already encountered functions without realizing it. An equation like `y = x + 1` can be viewed as a function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. It can be written in function notation as `y = f(x) = x + 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

For example, when `x` is 0, `f(0) = 0 + 1 = 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. When `x` is 2, `f(2) = 2 + 1 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. This is analogous to creating a table of `x` and `y` values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

Function notation makes it explicitly clear that the function takes an input, processes it (e.g., `x` becomes `x + 1`), and produces a single output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

<h3>What Is Not a Function?</h3>
A relationship is **not** a function if a single input can lead to multiple possible outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

<h4>Circle Equation Example</h4>
Consider the equation of a circle centered at the origin with a radius of 2: `x^2 + y^2 = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

If we look at the graph of this circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>:
*   Pick an input value for `x`, for example, `x = 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
*   Visually, for `x = 1`, there are two corresponding `y` values: one above the x-axis and one below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

Algebraically, we can verify this:
1.  Substitute `x = 1` into the equation: `1^2 + y^2 = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
2.  Simplify: `1 + y^2 = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
3.  Subtract 1 from both sides: `y^2 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
4.  Solve for `y`: `y = sqrt(3)` or `y = -sqrt(3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

Since a single input (`x = 1`) yields two different outputs (`sqrt(3)` and `-sqrt(3)`), this relationship is **not** a function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

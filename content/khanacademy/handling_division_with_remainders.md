Division involves splitting a total number into equal groups or finding how many times one number fits into another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. While some division problems result in a whole number, others may have a portion left over, known as a remainder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

## Prerequisite: Multiplication Tables

To effectively [[division_with_larger_numbers|divide into larger numbers]], it is essential to have a strong knowledge of [[importance_of_multiplication_tables_in_division|multiplication tables]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Specifically, memorizing tables from 1x1 up to at least 10x10 (or even 12x12, as traditionally taught) is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This foundation helps to quickly solve basic division problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

For instance:
*   To divide 25 by 5, one can think "5 times what equals 25?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Knowing the 5-multiplication table tells us that 5 times 5 is 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. So, 25 divided by 5 is 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. The 5 should be written in the ones place for correct place notation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   Similarly, for 49 divided by 7, the question is "7 times what equals 49?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Since 7 times 7 is 49, 49 divided by 7 is 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   To find how many times 9 goes into 54, we ask "9 times what equals 54?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. If 9 times 5 is 45, then 9 times 6 is 9 more, which is 54 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Therefore, 9 goes into 54 six times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## Introducing Remainders

Not all division problems result in a whole number. When a number does not divide cleanly, there is a remainder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

### Example: 23 divided by 3

To divide 23 by 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>:
1.  List multiples of 3: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
2.  Notice that 23 is not a multiple of 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
3.  Find the largest multiple of 3 that is less than or equal to 23. This is 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
4.  Determine how many times 3 goes into 21. Since 3 times 7 is 21, 3 goes into 21 seven times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
5.  Subtract 21 from 23 to find the remainder: 23 - 21 = 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

Therefore, 23 divided by 3 is 7 with a remainder of 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## Division with Larger Numbers (Long Division)

The concept of remainders is crucial when performing [[introduction_to_long_division|long division]] with [[division_with_larger_numbers|larger numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. Even if the overall division results in no remainder, intermediate steps may produce them.

### Example: 344 divided by 4

To divide 344 by 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>:
1.  **Check the first digit**: How many times does 4 go into 3? It goes in 0 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, so you move to the next digit.
2.  **Consider the first two digits**: How many times does 4 go into 34? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>
    *   Recall 4-multiplication tables: 4 times 8 is 32, and 4 times 9 is 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
    *   Since 36 is greater than 34, 4 goes into 34 eight times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Write the '8' in the tens place above the 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
    *   Multiply 8 by 4 to get 32 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Write 32 below 34 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
    *   Subtract: 34 - 32 = 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. This is the remainder from this step, representing 2 tens or 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
3.  **Bring down the next digit**: Bring down the '4' from 344 next to the remainder '2', forming 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
4.  **Divide the new number**: How many times does 4 go into 24? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>
    *   Recall: 4 times 6 is 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
    *   Write '6' in the ones place above the 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
    *   Multiply 6 by 4 to get 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Write 24 below the 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
    *   Subtract: 24 - 24 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

Since the remainder is 0, 4 goes into 344 exactly 86 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

### Example: 91 divided by 7

To divide 91 by 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>:
1.  **First digit**: How many times does 7 go into 9? One time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. Write '1' above the 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
2.  **Multiply and Subtract**: 1 times 7 is 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Subtract 7 from 9 to get 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. (This represents 2 tens, or 20) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
3.  **Bring down**: Bring down the '1', forming 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
4.  **Divide new number**: How many times does 7 go into 21? Three times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>, because 7 times 3 is 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. Write '3' above the 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
5.  **Multiply and Subtract**: 3 times 7 is 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. Subtract 21 from 21 to get 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

So, 91 divided by 7 is 13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

### Example: 608 divided by 8

To divide 608 by 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>:
1.  **First digit**: 8 goes into 6 zero times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
2.  **First two digits**: How many times does 8 go into 60? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>
    *   Recall 8-multiplication tables: 8 times 7 is 56, and 8 times 8 is 64 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
    *   Since 64 is too large, 8 goes into 60 seven times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. Write '7' above the 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
    *   Multiply 7 by 8 to get 56 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. Write 56 below 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
    *   Subtract: 60 - 56 = 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
3.  **Bring down**: Bring down the '8' from 608, forming 48 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
4.  **Divide new number**: How many times does 8 go into 48? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>
    *   Recall: 8 times 6 is exactly 48 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.
    *   Write '6' above the 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.
    *   Multiply 6 by 8 to get 48 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. Write 48 below the 48 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
    *   Subtract: 48 - 48 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

With a remainder of 0, 608 divided by 8 is 76 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

Understanding how to find the largest multiple that fits within a number and then calculating the remainder is key to solving division problems, especially those involving [[introduction_to_long_division|long division]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. In later stages, these remainders can be expressed as [[adding_fractions_with_different_denominators|fractions]] or decimals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

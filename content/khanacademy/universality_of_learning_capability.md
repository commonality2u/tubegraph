The fundamental premise of human learning asserts that no individual is born inherently smart; instead, everyone begins their [[the_journey_of_learning | journey of learning]] at a baseline, starting at zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Everyone Starts at Zero

Initially, individuals cannot talk, walk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, or perform complex tasks like algebra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, reading, or riding a bike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The concept extends to historical figures, as even Albert Einstein once couldn't count to ten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, and William Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs like everyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This highlights that proficiency in any skill is developed, not innate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## The Innate Capacity for Learning

Humans are inherently "born to learn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. [[The journey of learning | The learning process]] is incremental, characterized by stumbling, slipping, crawling, falling, and even failing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This struggle, despite its frustration, is integral to development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### The Role of Failure and Growth

Every "wrong answer" contributes to strengthening the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. In this context, [[the_importance_of_failure_in_learning | failing is redefined as growing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, emphasizing a [[growth_mindset | growth mindset]] where persistence is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. True learning involves the conviction that understanding will eventually come, even if it hasn't yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Building Complex Ideas from Simple Foundations

The most intricate and beautiful concepts in the universe are fundamentally constructed upon basic ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. These foundational principles are accessible and understandable to anyone, anywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This aligns with [[the_learning_process_from_simple_to_complex | the learning process from simple to complex]].

Regardless of an individual's background or location, the ultimate takeaway is that "you can learn anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This principle underpins the idea of [[global_education_and_accessibility | global education and accessibility]].

This article outlines various techniques to practice and understand [[basic_addition_concepts | basic addition]]. While addition might initially seem challenging, with practice, it will become basic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## [[using_objects_for_addition | Using Objects]]

One fundamental way to understand addition is by using objects.
*   **Example: 1 plus 1**
    If you have 1 avocado and are given another avocado, you will have 2 avocados total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Thus, 1 plus 1 equals 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   **Example: 3 plus 4**
    Starting with 3 avocados and adding 4 more results in a total of 7 avocados <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. So, 3 plus 4 equals 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
    This method involves drawing circles or objects to count the total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

## The [[number_line_technique_for_addition_and_subtraction | Number Line]]

The [[number_line_for_addition | number line]] is another effective method for visualizing addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Concept**: A number line lists numbers in order, starting from 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. To add, you start at the first number and move to the right (or "go up") on the number line by the amount of the second number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Example: 3 plus 4**
    Start at 3 on the number line and move 4 steps to the right (1, 2, 3, 4). You will land on 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Example: 8 plus 1**
    Starting at 8 and adding 1 means moving one step to the right, which lands you on 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. So, 8 plus 1 equals 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Example: 5 plus 6**
    Start at 5 and move 6 steps to the right. You will land on 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Thus, 5 plus 6 equals 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   **Example: 8 plus 7**
    Starting at 8 and moving 7 steps to the right will land you on 15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. So, 8 plus 7 is 15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

## [[commutative_property_of_addition | Commutative Property]]

An important concept in addition is that the order of the numbers does not change the sum. This is known as the [[commutative_property_of_addition | commutative property]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   **Example: 5 plus 6 vs. 6 plus 5**
    As seen with the number line, both 5 plus 6 and 6 plus 5 yield the same result of 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. This also makes sense when using objects: having 5 avocados and getting 6 more, or having 6 avocados and getting 5 more, both result in a total of 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

## Practice and Memorization

Initially, you can use techniques like drawing circles or the [[number_line_for_addition | number line]] to solve problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. With consistent practice, you will eventually memorize the sums and be able to solve problems very quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. [[multiplication_as_repeated_addition | Multiplication]] also requires similar practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

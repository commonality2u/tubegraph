This article explores two distinct methods for solving quadratic equations: [[Completing the square as a technique for solving quadratic equations | completing the square]] and [[Solving quadratic equations by factoring | factoring]]. While both aim to find the solutions to quadratic equations, they differ significantly in their applicability and complexity, especially when dealing with various types of coefficients.

## Completing the Square: A Universal Technique

[[Completing the square as a technique for solving quadratic equations | Completing the square]] is a powerful technique applicable to any quadratic equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. It is also the fundamental basis for the [[Completing the square and derivation of the quadratic formula | derivation of the quadratic formula]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, which further underscores its universal utility. The core idea behind [[Completing the square as a technique for solving quadratic equations | completing the square]] is to manipulate the quadratic equation to transform one side into a perfect square trinomial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This is achieved by adding the appropriate constant term to both sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

To make an expression like `x² + bx` a perfect square, one must add `(b/2)²` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This value is derived from the pattern `(x + a)² = x² + 2ax + a²`, where `b` corresponds to `2a`, meaning `a` is `b/2`, and the added constant is `a²` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Comparison Through Examples

### Example 1: `x² - 4x = 5`

This quadratic equation can be solved using both methods.

#### Using Completing the Square

1.  **Prepare the equation**: Start with `x² - 4x = 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
2.  **Identify the constant to add**: Take half of the coefficient of `x` (`-4`), which is `-2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Square this value: `(-2)² = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
3.  **Add to both sides**: Add `4` to both sides of the equation to maintain balance: `x² - 4x + 4 = 5 + 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
4.  **Form a perfect square**: The left side becomes a perfect square: `(x - 2)² = 9` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
5.  **Solve**: Take the square root of both sides: `x - 2 = ±3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
6.  **Isolate `x`**: `x = 2 ± 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
7.  **Solutions**: `x = 5` or `x = -1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

#### Using Factoring

1.  **Standard form**: Rearrange the equation to `x² - 4x - 5 = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
2.  **Find factors**: Look for two numbers whose product is `-5` and whose sum is `-4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. These numbers are `-5` and `1`.
3.  **Factor the trinomial**: `(x - 5)(x + 1) = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
4.  **Set factors to zero**: Apply the zero product property: `x - 5 = 0` or `x + 1 = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
5.  **Solutions**: `x = 5` or `x = -1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

For this specific example, [[Solving quadratic equations by factoring | factoring]] was arguably a faster method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

### Example 2: `10x² - 30x - 8 = 0`

This equation is more challenging for [[Factoring in algebra | factoring]].

1.  **Simplify coefficients**: Divide the entire equation by `2`: `5x² - 15x - 4 = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
2.  **Normalize leading coefficient**: For [[Completing the square as a technique for solving quadratic equations | completing the square]], it's beneficial to have a leading coefficient of `1`. Divide by `5`: `x² - 3x - 4/5 = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
3.  **Difficulty with Factoring**: At this point, attempting to [[Factoring quadratic expressions | factor]] would require finding two numbers whose [[Product and sum relationships in factoring | product is -4/5]] and whose [[Product and sum relationships in factoring | sum is -3]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Dealing with fractions makes this "super hard to do just using [[Factoring in algebra | factoring]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

#### Using Completing the Square

1.  **Isolate x-terms**: Move the constant term to the right side: `x² - 3x = 4/5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
2.  **Identify the constant to add**: Take half of the coefficient of `x` (`-3`), which is `-3/2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. Square this value: `(-3/2)² = 9/4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
3.  **Add to both sides**: `x² - 3x + 9/4 = 4/5 + 9/4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
4.  **Simplify the right side**: Find a common denominator for the right side (20): `16/20 + 45/20 = 61/20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.
5.  **Form a perfect square**: `(x - 3/2)² = 61/20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
6.  **Solve**: Take the square root of both sides: `x - 3/2 = ±√(61/20)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
7.  **Isolate `x`**: `x = 3/2 ± √(61/20)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

The resulting solutions are complex, demonstrating that [[Completing the square as a technique for solving quadratic equations | completing the square]] "will always work no matter what the coefficients are or no matter how crazy the problem is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. It provides a reliable method even when [[Factoring in algebra | factoring]] is impractical or impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

## Conclusion

While [[Solving quadratic equations by factoring | factoring]] can be a quicker path to solutions for easily factorable quadratic equations, [[Completing the square as a technique for solving quadratic equations | completing the square]] offers a universally applicable method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Its reliability makes it indispensable, especially for equations that do not easily factor into integers or simple fractions, and it forms the basis for the powerful [[Relation between completing the square and the quadratic formula | quadratic formula]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

Geometry is a branch of mathematics concerned with the properties and relations of points, lines, surfaces, and solids. The word "geometry" itself is derived from the root word "geo," which refers to the earth, and "metry," which comes from measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. You might see "metry" in words like [[introduction_to_trigonometry | trigonometry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Therefore, geometry literally means "earth measurement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Geometry is the study of shapes, space, and how objects relate to each other visually and mathematically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

Common elements studied in geometry include lines, triangles, circles, angles, patterns, and three-dimensional shapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Fundamental Geometric Concepts

### Point
A **point** is defined as a specific position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. You cannot move on a point; if you move in any direction, you are no longer at that point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Points are typically labeled with letters (e.g., Point A, Point B) to distinguish them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### Dimensions
A point has [[concept_of_dimensions_in_geometry | zero dimensions]] because you cannot travel in any direction while staying on the point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

### Line Segment
A **line segment** is a collection of all points that connect two specific points, called **endpoints**, along a straight path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. For example, if points A and B are endpoints, the line segment connecting them is denoted as $\overline{AB}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. The order of the endpoints does not matter for a line segment; $\overline{AB}$ is the same as $\overline{BA}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

A line segment is considered a [[concept_of_dimensions_in_geometry | one-dimensional]] object because you can only move back and forth along its length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. Geometrically, a pure line segment has no width, only length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. The length of a line segment is denoted by simply writing the endpoints without the line symbol above them (e.g., $AB = 5$ units means the length of line segment AB is 5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

### Ray
A **ray** is a [[line_segments_rays_and_lines_in_geometry | one-dimensional]] object that starts at a specific point, called the **vertex**, and extends infinitely in one direction through another point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. For example, a ray starting at point A and going through point D is denoted as $\overrightarrow{AD}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. The order of the points matters for a ray; $\overrightarrow{AD}$ is different from $\overrightarrow{DA}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

### Line
A **line** is a [[line_segments_rays_and_lines_in_geometry | one-dimensional]] object that extends infinitely in both directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Unlike a line segment, a line has no endpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. If a line passes through points E and F, it is denoted as $\overleftrightarrow{EF}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

### Collinear Points
Points are **collinear** if they all lie on the same line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. For example, if points X, Y, and Z are on the same line, they are collinear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

### Midpoint
The **midpoint** of a line segment is the point that is exactly halfway between its two endpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. If point Z is the midpoint of line segment XY, then the distance from X to Z is equal to the distance from Z to Y (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>).

### Plane
A **plane** is a [[concept_of_dimensions_in_geometry | two-dimensional]] object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. On a plane, you can move in two different directions, such as right/left and up/down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. The surface of a screen or a piece of paper extending infinitely in every direction can be thought of as a plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. A finite piece of a plane, like a physical sheet of paper, could be considered a "plane segment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

### Three-Dimensional Space
**Three-dimensional space** adds a third dimension, allowing movement not only left/right and up/down but also in/out (or depth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. Beyond three dimensions, it becomes difficult to visualize, but higher dimensions are studied in mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

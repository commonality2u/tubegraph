The [[mode|Mode]] is defined as the number that appears most frequently within a given dataset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:42">[03:33:42]</a>.

## Identifying the Mode

To find the mode, you observe which number shows up the greatest number of times in the data set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:42">[03:35:42]</a>.

## Example Calculation

For the set of numbers provided (23, 29, 20, 32, 23, 21, 33, 25) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>:
*   Most numbers appear only once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:42">[03:37:42]</a>.
*   The number 23 appears twice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:42">[03:41:42]</a>.
*   Since 23 appears more often than any other number, it is the mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:42">[03:47:42]</a>.

The [[mode|mode]] is one of the measures used to understand the [[mean_or_central_tendency_in_statistics|central tendency]] or the "middle" of a dataset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

[[understanding_relationships_and_equations_in_algebra | Understanding relationships and equations in algebra]] can be made clearer by [[visual_representation_of_equations | visualizing]] the operations being performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This approach helps to intuitively grasp what is allowed and what isn't, rather than simply memorizing rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The goal in solving an equation is to [[understanding_like_terms_in_algebra | isolate]] the variable, typically 'x', to find its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Solving an Equation Through Visualization

Consider the equation: `2x + 3 = 5x - 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

### Initial Visual Representation
*   **Left-hand side (2x + 3)**: Represented as two 'x' units (e.g., orange 'x's) plus three '+1' units (e.g., individual squares or circles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Right-hand side (5x - 2)**: Represented as five 'x' units (e.g., blue 'x's) minus two '-1' units (e.g., pink '-1's) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

While solving, only the [[understanding_algebraic_expressions | algebraic steps]] are necessary, but the visualization helps in [[visual_representation_of_equations | understanding what the equation says]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

### Isolating the Variable

The principle is to perform operations on both sides of the equation to maintain balance, eventually isolating 'x' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

#### Step 1: Moving 'x' Terms
To gather 'x' terms on one side, you can [[performing_legitimate_algebraic_operations | subtract 2x from both sides]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Visual**: Removing two 'x' units from the left side and two 'x' units from the right side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   **Algebraic**:
    ```
    2x + 3 - 2x = 5x - 2 - 2x
    3 = 3x - 2
    ```
    On the left, the '2x' terms cancel out, leaving '3' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. On the right, `5x - 2x` becomes `3x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

#### Step 2: Moving Constant Terms
To get rid of the constant on the side with 'x', [[performing_legitimate_algebraic_operations | add 2 to both sides]] of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   **Visual**: Adding two '+1' units to both sides. On the right, the two added '+1's cancel out the existing two '-1's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   **Algebraic**:
    ```
    3 + 2 = 3x - 2 + 2
    5 = 3x
    ```
    On the left, `3 + 2` equals `5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. On the right, the '-2' and '+2' cancel out, leaving '3x' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

#### Step 3: Dividing by the Coefficient
To solve for 'x', [[performing_legitimate_algebraic_operations | divide both sides by the coefficient]] of 'x', which is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
*   **Visual**: This is harder to visualize with whole units, but conceptually, you are dividing 5 units into 3 equal groups and 3 'x' units into 3 equal groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
*   **Algebraic**:
    ```
    5 / 3 = 3x / 3
    5/3 = x
    ```
    The 3s on the right cancel out, leaving 'x' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. The result is `x = 5/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

The solution `x = 5/3` can also be written as a mixed number, `x = 1 2/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. [[visualizing_multiplication_in_equations | Visualizing multiplication in equations]] and division with fractions can be more complex, but the core idea of maintaining balance across the equals sign remains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

This visual process reinforces that any [[performing_legitimate_algebraic_operations | legitimate operation]] applied to one side of an equation must also be applied to the other side to keep the equation balanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

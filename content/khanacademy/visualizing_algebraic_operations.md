When solving algebraic equations, visualizing the operations can provide common sense as to what manipulations are allowed, rather than just memorizing rules or steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. The ultimate goal is to [[understanding_equality_in_algebra|isolate the variable]] (e.g., `x`) to determine its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Example: Solving `2x + 3 = 5x - 2`

Let's solve a more involved equation: `2x + 3 = 5x - 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This equation has `x` terms on both sides, along with constant terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

### Initial Visualization

To visualize, we can represent variables and constants:
*   `2x` is two `x` units (`x + x`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   `+3` is three `+1` units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   `5x` is five `x` units (`x + x + x + x + x`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   `-2` is two `-1` units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

So, the equation `2x + 3 = 5x - 2` can be seen as two `x`'s and three `+1`'s on the left, being equal to five `x`'s and two `-1`'s on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### Step 1: Consolidate `x` Terms

To [[combining_like_terms_in_algebra|isolate the x's]] on one side, we can subtract `2x` from both sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

Algebraically:
`2x + 3 - 2x = 5x - 2 - 2x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>

Visually, this means removing two `x` units from both the left and right sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   On the left, `2x` and `-2x` cancel out, leaving `3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   On the right, `5x - 2x` results in `3x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

The equation simplifies to:
`3 = 3x - 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>

### Step 2: Consolidate Constant Terms

Now, we need to [[understanding_equality_in_algebra|isolate the x's]] further by getting rid of the `-2` on the right side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. We can do this by adding `2` to both sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

Algebraically:
`3 + 2 = 3x - 2 + 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>

Visually, adding two `+1` units to both sides:
*   On the left, `3 + 2` equals `5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   On the right, `-2` and `+2` cancel out, leaving `3x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Visually, two `-1` units and two `+1` units would cancel each other out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

The equation simplifies to:
`5 = 3x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>

### Step 3: Solve for a Single `x`

The final step is to solve for `x` by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of `x`, which is `3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. The coefficient is the number multiplying the variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

Algebraically:
`5 / 3 = 3x / 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>

*   On the left, we have the fraction `5/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   On the right, the `3`'s cancel out, leaving `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

So, the solution is:
`5/3 = x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>

This can also be written as a mixed number: `1 2/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. The order of `x` on the left or right side does not change the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

#### Visualizing Division with Fractions

Visualizing this final step with fractions can be more challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. If `5` units are equal to `3x` units, then dividing `5` into `3` equal groups means each group would be `1 2/3` units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

By following these steps, we arrive at `x = 5/3` or `x = 1 2/3`. This solution can be substituted back into the original equation to verify its correctness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. While the [[algebraic_solution_techniques_vs_graphing|algebraic steps]] are usually sufficient for solving, visualizing the process helps to understand why each operation is valid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

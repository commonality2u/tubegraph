Converting between fractions and decimals involves specific methods that can sometimes lead to [[simplifying fractions|simplified fractional representations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>.

## Converting Fractions to Decimals

To convert a fraction into a decimal, divide the numerator by the denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. This method consistently works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. When performing the division, decimal points and trailing zeros can be added to the numerator to maintain precision without changing the number's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.

### Examples:

*   **1/2** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>
    *   Divide 1 by 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>.
    *   2 goes into 10 five times (after adding a decimal and zero) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.
    *   Result: 0.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>.

*   **1/3** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>
    *   Divide 1 by 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a>.
    *   3 goes into 10 three times, leaving a remainder of 1, which continues to repeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:27">[01:27:27]</a>.
    *   Result: 0.3333... which repeats indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:45">[01:45:45]</a>. This can be represented as 0.3 with a line over the 3, or 0.33 with a line over both 3s, indicating the pattern repeats indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:11">[02:11:11]</a>.

*   **17/9** (Improper Fraction) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:41">[02:41:41]</a>
    *   Since the numerator is larger than the denominator, the decimal will be greater than 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:50">[02:50:50]</a>.
    *   Divide 17 by 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:55">[02:55:55]</a>.
    *   9 goes into 17 one time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:06">[03:06:06]</a>, with a remainder of 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:11">[03:11:11]</a>.
    *   After adding a decimal and zeros, 9 goes into 80 eight times, leaving a remainder of 8, which continues to repeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:16">[03:16:16]</a>.
    *   Result: 1.888... where the 8 repeats indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:46">[03:46:46]</a>. This can be written as 1.8 with a line over the 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:11">[04:11:11]</a>. It could be rounded to approximately 1.89 if rounding to the hundredths place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:02">[04:02:02]</a>.

*   **17/93** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:29">[04:29:29]</a>
    *   Divide 17 by 93 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:50">[04:50:50]</a>.
    *   93 goes into 17 zero times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:59">[04:59:59]</a>.
    *   93 goes into 170 one time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:04">[05:04:04]</a>, then 93 goes into 770 approximately eight times, and so on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:20">[05:20:20]</a>.
    *   Result: Approximately 0.182 with further decimals if computed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:12">[06:12:12]</a>. In exams, you might be asked to round to a specific decimal place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:27">[06:27:27]</a>.

## Converting Decimals to Fractions

Converting decimals to fractions is generally simpler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:37">[06:37:37]</a>.

The method involves identifying the place value of the last significant digit in the decimal.

### Examples:

*   **0.035** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:42">[06:42:42]</a>
    *   The "5" is in the thousandths place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:21">[07:21:21]</a>.
    *   This means 0.035 can be written as 35 over 1,000 (35/1,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:06">[07:06:06]</a>.

*   **0.030** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:29">[07:29:29]</a>
    *   This can be expressed as 30/1,000 because the '0' is in the thousandths place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:43">[07:43:43]</a>.
    *   Alternatively, 0.030 is equivalent to 0.03, as the trailing zero after the last non-zero digit doesn't add value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:55">[07:55:55]</a>.
    *   For 0.03, the '3' is in the hundredths place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:02">[08:02:02]</a>, so it can be written as 3/100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:05">[08:05:05]</a>.
    *   Both 30/1,000 and 3/100 are equivalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:11">[08:11:11]</a>.

## [[simplifying_fractions|Simplifying Fractional Results]]

After converting a decimal to a fraction, the resulting fraction can often be [[simplifying_fractions|simplified]] to its lowest terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:32">[08:32:32]</a>. This involves dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:17">[08:17:17]</a>.

### Example:

*   **35/1,000** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:06">[07:06:06]</a>
    *   This fraction can be [[simplifying_fractions|simplified]] by dividing both the numerator (35) and the denominator (1,000) by 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:32">[08:32:32]</a>.
    *   35 รท 5 = 7
    *   1,000 รท 5 = 200
    *   The [[simplifying_fractions|simplified]] form is 7/200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:40">[08:40:40]</a>.
    *   To verify, converting 7/200 back to a decimal should yield 0.035 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:47">[08:47:47]</a>.

*   **30/1,000** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:43">[07:43:43]</a>
    *   This fraction can be [[simplifying_fractions|simplified]] by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:17">[08:17:17]</a>.
    *   30 รท 10 = 3
    *   1,000 รท 10 = 100
    *   The [[simplifying_fractions|simplified]] form is 3/100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:20">[08:20:20]</a>.

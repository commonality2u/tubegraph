Gametogenesis is the process by which gametes (sex cells) are produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02"></a>. This process occurs in the [[cell_division_in_somatic_and_germ_cells | germ cells]] and is essential for [[role_of_mitosis_and_meiosis_in_human_reproduction | sexual reproduction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00"></a>. Unlike [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]], which produces two diploid cells, gametogenesis involves [[overview_of_meiosis | meiosis]], resulting in four haploid cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00"></a>.

## Starting Point: Interphase

Before [[overview_of_meiosis | meiosis]] begins, the diploid [[cell_division_in_somatic_and_germ_cells | germ cell]] spends most of its time in interphase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00"></a>. During the S phase of interphase, the cell undergoes [[process_of_dna_replication | DNA replication]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00"></a>. This means each chromosome, including [[role_of_homologous_pairs_in_meiosis | homologous pairs]] (one from each parent), duplicates to form two sister chromatids joined at a centromere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00"></a>. The centrosomes also replicate during this phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00"></a>.

## Meiosis I

Meiosis involves two rounds of division, with the first being Meiosis I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00"></a>. This round reduces the chromosome number from diploid to haploid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00"></a>.

### [[phases_of_meiosis | Prophase I]]
Similar to prophase in [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]], the nuclear envelope begins to disappear, and the chromatin condenses into visible chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00"></a>. The centrosomes move to opposite poles, beginning to form spindle fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00"></a>. A key difference in [[phases_of_meiosis | Prophase I]] is that [[role_of_homologous_pairs_in_meiosis | homologous pairs]] of chromosomes line up next to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00"></a>. This alignment allows for [[genetic_recombination_and_crossing_over | genetic recombination]], also known as crossing over, where analogous segments of non-sister chromatids are exchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00"></a>. This process generates significant genetic variation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:36"></a>.

### [[phases_of_meiosis | Metaphase I]]
In [[phases_of_meiosis | Metaphase I]], the [[role_of_homologous_pairs_in_meiosis | homologous pairs]] align along the metaphase plate (the cell's equator) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00"></a>. Spindle fibers from the centrosomes attach to the kinetochores located at the centromeres of each homologous chromosome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00"></a>. The orientation of each homologous pair at the metaphase plate is random, further contributing to genetic variation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:15"></a>.

### [[phases_of_meiosis | Anaphase I]]
During [[phases_of_meiosis | Anaphase I]], the [[role_of_homologous_pairs_in_meiosis | homologous pairs]] separate and are pulled to opposite poles of the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:08"></a>. Crucially, the sister chromatids remain attached to each other and move as a single unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:22"></a>. This is a key distinction from anaphase in [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]], where sister chromatids separate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:13"></a>.

### [[phases_of_meiosis | Telophase I]]
In [[phases_of_meiosis | Telophase I]], the chromosomes arrive at opposite poles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:48"></a>. The nuclear envelope may reform around the separated sets of chromosomes, and cytokinesis (division of the cytoplasm) occurs, resulting in two haploid cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:29"></a>. Each of these cells now contains half the original number of chromosomes, but each chromosome still consists of two sister chromatids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:02"></a>.

## Meiosis II

Following Meiosis I, the two haploid cells enter Meiosis II, which is very similar to [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00"></a>.

### [[phases_of_meiosis | Prophase II]]
The nuclear envelope, if it reformed, disintegrates again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00"></a>. Centrosomes replicate and move to opposite poles of each cell, preparing to form new spindle fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00"></a>.

### [[phases_of_meiosis | Metaphase II]]
In each of the two haploid cells, the chromosomes (each still composed of two sister chromatids) align individually along the metaphase plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:42"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00"></a>. Spindle fibers attach to the kinetochores on each sister chromatid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00"></a>.

### [[phases_of_meiosis | Anaphase II]]
During [[phases_of_meiosis | Anaphase II]], the sister chromatids finally separate and are pulled to opposite poles of the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:17"></a>. Once separated, each chromatid is considered a full chromosome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00"></a>.

### [[phases_of_meiosis | Telophase II]]
In [[phases_of_meiosis | Telophase II]], the separated chromosomes arrive at opposite poles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00"></a>. Nuclear envelopes reform around each set of chromosomes, and cytokinesis takes place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00"></a>.

The end result of gametogenesis is four haploid cells, known as gametes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00"></a>. Each gamete contains a unique combination of chromosomes due to the random assortment of [[role_of_homologous_pairs_in_meiosis | homologous pairs]] in Meiosis I and [[genetic_recombination and_crossing_over | crossing over]] in [[phases_of_meiosis | Prophase I]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00"></a>.

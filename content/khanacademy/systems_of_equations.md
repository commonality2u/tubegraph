A [[solving_systems_of_equations|system of equations]] consists of two or more equations that share variables and are intended to be solved simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While previously discussed methods involved [[graphical_representation_of_linear_equations|graphing]] to find the intersection point, algebraic techniques offer an exact solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This article focuses on the [[solving_linear_systems_by_substitution|substitution method]].

## The Substitution Method

The [[solving_linear_systems_by_substitution|substitution method]] is an algebraic technique for [[solving_systems_of_equations|solving systems of equations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. It involves using one equation to solve for one variable and then substituting that expression into the other equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This process transforms a [[solving_systems_of_equations|system of equations]] into a single equation with one unknown, which can then be solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### Steps for Solving with Substitution

1.  **Isolate a Variable**: Choose one of the equations and solve for one of its variables (e.g., solve for `x` in terms of `y`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
2.  **Substitute**: Substitute the expression found in step 1 into the *other* equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. This will result in a [[solving_equations_with_variables|single linear equation]] with only one variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
3.  **Solve for the First Variable**: [[solving_simple_linear_equations|Solve]] this new equation to find the value of the remaining variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
4.  **Solve for the Second Variable**: Substitute the numerical value found in step 3 back into the expression from step 1 (or either of the original equations) to find the value of the other variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
5.  **Verify**: Check the solution by substituting both values into both original equations to ensure they are satisfied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### Example 1: Basic System

Consider the following [[solving_systems_of_equations|system of equations]]:
1.  `x + 2y = 9` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
2.  `3x + 5y = 20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>

1.  **Isolate `x` from the first equation**:
    `x + 2y = 9`
    Subtract `2y` from both sides:
    `x = 9 - 2y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>

2.  **Substitute `(9 - 2y)` for `x` in the second equation**:
    `3(9 - 2y) + 5y = 20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>

3.  **Solve for `y`**:
    `27 - 6y + 5y = 20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>
    `27 - y = 20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>
    Subtract `27` from both sides:
    `-y = -7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>
    Multiply by `-1`:
    `y = 7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>

4.  **Solve for `x`**:
    Substitute `y = 7` into `x = 9 - 2y`:
    `x = 9 - 2(7)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>
    `x = 9 - 14` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>
    `x = -5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>

The solution to the [[solving_systems_of_equations|system of equations]] is `x = -5` and `y = 7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. If these [[representation_of_linear_equations|linear equations]] were graphed, they would intersect at the point `(-5, 7)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

## Word Problems Involving Systems of Equations

The [[solving_linear_systems_by_substitution|substitution method]] is also useful for [[word_problems_involving_systems_of_equations|word problems involving systems of equations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. The first step is to translate the problem's conditions into a [[solving_systems_of_equations|system of algebraic equations]].

### Example 2: Sum and Difference

**Problem**: The sum of two numbers is 70, and they differ by 11. What are the numbers? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>

1.  **Define Variables**: Let `x` be the larger number and `y` be the smaller number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

2.  **Formulate Equations**:
    *   "The sum of two numbers is 70": `x + y = 70` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>
    *   "They differ by 11": `x - y = 11` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>

    This forms a [[solving_systems_of_equations|system of two equations]] with two unknowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

3.  **Isolate a Variable**: Isolate `x` from the second equation:
    `x - y = 11`
    Add `y` to both sides:
    `x = 11 + y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>

4.  **Substitute**: Substitute `(11 + y)` for `x` into the first equation:
    `(11 + y) + y = 70` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>

5.  **Solve for `y`**:
    `11 + 2y = 70` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>
    Subtract `11` from both sides:
    `2y = 59` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>
    Divide by `2`:
    `y = 59 / 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>
    `y = 29.5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>

6.  **Solve for `x`**:
    Substitute `y = 29.5` into `x = 11 + y`:
    `x = 11 + 29.5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>
    `x = 40.5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>

The two numbers are `40.5` and `29.5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

```ad-note
**Verification**:
*   Sum: `40.5 + 29.5 = 70` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a> (Correct)
*   Difference: `40.5 - 29.5 = 11` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a> (Correct)
```

The [[solving_linear_systems_by_substitution|substitution method]] ensures an exact algebraic answer, which is often difficult to obtain precisely through [[graphical_representation_of_linear_equations|graphing]] alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

Vectors and scalars are fundamental concepts in mathematics and physics, often sounding complicated but being quite simple ideas in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The distinction between them becomes clear through examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## What is a Vector?
A vector is a quantity that possesses both a magnitude (or size) and a specific direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

### Examples of Vectors
*   **Displacement:** When discussing the change in position of an object, if both the distance moved and the direction of movement are specified, it is a vector quantity called displacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. For instance, moving a brick 5 meters to the right is a displacement, as it includes a magnitude (5 meters) and a direction (to the right) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   **Velocity:** Velocity describes how fast something is going while also indicating the direction of its movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. For example, a brick moving at 2.5 meters per second to the right is a velocity, as it includes both a speed (magnitude) and a direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

## What is a Scalar?
A scalar is a quantity that has only a magnitude (or size) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. It does not have a direction associated with it.

### Examples of Scalars
*   **Distance:** Distance refers to the total length of the path traveled by an object, without specifying the direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. If one simply states that a brick moved 5 meters, it is a scalar quantity because only the size of the movement is known, not its direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Speed:** Speed measures how fast an object is moving without indicating its direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. For instance, stating that a brick moved at 2.5 meters per second is a speed, as it only provides the magnitude of how fast it went <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.
*   **Time:** Time is generally considered a scalar quantity in simple physics, as it is understood to progress in only one direction (positive) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. For example, a duration of 2 seconds is a scalar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

> This article highlights the key [[difference_between_vectors_and_scalars | difference between vectors and scalars]]: vectors have both magnitude and direction, while scalars have only magnitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

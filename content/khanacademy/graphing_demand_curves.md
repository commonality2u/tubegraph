In microeconomics, understanding the relationship between the price of a product and the amount consumers are willing to buy is fundamental. This relationship is often visualized using a [[demand schedule and demand curve | demand curve]].

## The [[law of demand | Law of Demand]]

The [[law of demand | law of demand]] is a core idea in microeconomics, stating that if the price of a product is raised, the [[effects of price changes on quantity demanded | quantity demanded]] for that product will decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Conversely, if the price of a product is lowered, the [[effects of price changes on quantity demanded | quantity demanded]] will increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. While generally true, there are some exceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## [[demand vs quantity demanded | Demand vs. Quantity Demanded]]

It is important to distinguish between "demand" and "quantity demanded" in economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **Quantity Demanded**: Refers to a specific amount of a product that people are willing to buy at a given price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Demand**: Refers to the entire relationship, all else equal (ceteris paribus), between price and [[demand vs quantity demanded | quantity demanded]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This relationship can be represented by a [[demand schedule and demand curve | demand schedule]] or a [[demand schedule and demand curve | demand curve]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

When only price changes, it results in a change in [[demand vs quantity demanded | quantity demanded]], which is observed as a movement along the [[demand schedule and demand curve | demand curve]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. If other factors besides price were to change, the entire "demand" would shift, resulting in a new [[demand schedule and demand curve | demand curve]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

## The [[demand schedule and demand curve | Demand Schedule]]

A [[demand schedule and demand curve | demand schedule]] is a table that illustrates the relationship between price and [[demand vs quantity demanded | quantity demanded]], assuming all other factors remain constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

### Example: "Space Whatever" Ebook
Consider a hypothetical ebook, "Space Whatever," and its market study results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>:

| Scenario | Price ($) | Quantity Demanded (Units) |
| :------- | :-------- | :------------------------ |
| A        | $2        | 60,000                    |
| B        | $4        | 40,000                    |
| C        | $6        | 30,000                    |
| D        | $8        | 25,000                    |
| E        | $10       | 23,000                    |

This table directly demonstrates the [[law of demand | law of demand]]: as the price increases, the [[demand vs quantity demanded | quantity demanded]] decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

## Graphing the [[demand schedule and demand curve | Demand Curve]]

A [[demand schedule and demand curve | demand curve]] is a visual representation of the [[demand schedule and demand curve | demand schedule]]. It plots the price against the [[demand vs quantity demanded | quantity demanded]] to show the continuous relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

### Axis Convention
In economics, a common convention (though sometimes seen as counter-intuitive as it differs from typical mathematical [[graphing equations | graphing]] where the independent variable is on the horizontal axis) is to place:
*   **Price** on the **vertical axis** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>
*   **Quantity Demanded** on the **horizontal axis** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>

### Plotting the Points
Using the "Space Whatever" ebook example:

1.  **Scenario A**: At a price of $2, 60,000 units are demanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This is plotted as (60,000, $2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
2.  **Scenario B**: At $4, 40,000 units are demanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. This is plotted as (40,000, $4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
3.  **Scenario C**: At $6, 30,000 units are demanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. This is plotted as (30,000, $6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
4.  **Scenario D**: At $8, 25,000 units are demanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. This is plotted as (25,000, $8) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
5.  **Scenario E**: At $10, 23,000 units are demanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. This is plotted as (23,000, $10) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

Connecting these points, and assuming that prices in between are also possible (e.g., $2.01 or $4.50) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, forms a continuous downward-sloping curve. This curve represents the entire "demand" for the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

While this video focuses on how the [[demand vs quantity demanded | quantity demanded]] changes relative to price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, future discussions will explore how "demand" (the entire relationship or curve) might shift due to other factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

[[basic_concepts_in_probability_and_statistics | Statistics]] is a method for understanding and interpreting data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. It is fundamentally centered around data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Types of Statistics

The study of [[basic_concepts_in_probability_and_statistics | statistics]] often begins with [[descriptive_statistics | descriptive statistics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

*   **[[descriptive_statistics | Descriptive Statistics]]**: This involves summarizing a large set of data with a smaller set of numbers without presenting all of the raw data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The goal is to describe the data effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   **Inferential Statistics**: After building a toolkit in [[descriptive_statistics | descriptive statistics]], one can start making inferences, conclusions, and judgments about the data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Describing Data

To describe a set of numbers, such as the heights of plants in a garden, the aim is often to find a single number that represents the entire set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This representative number might be a "typical" number, a "middle" number, or the "most frequent" number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This concept is formalized as a measure of [[central_tendency_in_statistics | central tendency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

### Measures of [[central_tendency_in_statistics | Central Tendency]]

The term "average" in [[basic_concepts_in_probability_and_statistics | statistics]] is a general concept referring to a typical, middle, or center number within a data set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. There are several types of averages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

Consider the following data set, representing plant heights in inches: 4, 3, 1, 6, 1, 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

#### Arithmetic Mean

The arithmetic mean, often simply called "the average" in everyday language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, is calculated by summing all the numbers in a data set and dividing by the count of numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. This is a human-constructed definition found to be useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

For the plant height data set:
Sum = 4 + 3 + 1 + 6 + 1 + 7 = 22 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>
Number of data points = 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>
Arithmetic Mean = 22 / 6 = 3 and 4/6 = 3 and 2/3 â‰ˆ 3.6 repeating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

#### Median

The median is the literal middle number in a data set once all numbers are ordered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

To find the median of the plant height data set (4, 3, 1, 6, 1, 7):
1.  Order the numbers: 1, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
2.  Since there is an even number of data points (6), there isn't one single middle number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. The two middle numbers are 3 and 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
3.  The median is the arithmetic mean (halfway point) of these two middle numbers: (3 + 4) / 2 = 3.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

For a data set with an odd number of values, the median is the single middle number. For example, in the data set 0, 7, 50, 10,000, 1,000,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>, the median is 50, as it is the number with two values less than it and two values greater than it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

#### Mode

The mode is the most common number in a data set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. If all numbers appear with equal frequency, there is no mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

For the plant height data set (4, 3, 1, 6, 1, 7):
*   4 appears once.
*   3 appears once.
*   1 appears twice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
*   6 appears once.
*   7 appears once.
The number that appears most frequently is 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Therefore, the mode is 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

These different measures of [[central_tendency_in_statistics | central tendency]] provide varied insights into the "typical" or "middle" value of a data set and are useful in different contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. The median, for instance, can be particularly useful when a data set contains extreme values that might "skew" the arithmetic mean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

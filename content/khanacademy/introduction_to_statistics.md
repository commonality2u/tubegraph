[[introduction_to_statistics | Statistics]] is a discipline focused on understanding and making sense of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. It provides methods to comprehend and get insights from various datasets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Types of Statistics

The study of statistics typically begins with two main approaches:

### [[descriptive_statistics | Descriptive Statistics]]
[[descriptive_statistics | Descriptive statistics]] involves summarizing and describing a large set of data using a smaller, more manageable set of numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. The goal is to convey information about the entire dataset without presenting all the individual data points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.

### [[introduction_to_inferential_statistics | Inferential Statistics]]
After building a toolkit in [[descriptive_statistics | descriptive statistics]], the next step is [[introduction_to_inferential_statistics | inferential statistics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. This branch involves making inferences, conclusions, and judgments about data, often based on samples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.

## Measures of [[introduction_to_variables | Central Tendency]] (Averages)

When describing data, especially with a single number, one common approach is to find a "typical" or "middle" value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. In statistics, the term "average" is more general than its everyday usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. It refers to any measure that attempts to find a [[introduction_to_variables | central tendency]] within a dataset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.

Consider a dataset of plant heights (in inches): 4, 3, 1, 6, 1, 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.

### Arithmetic Mean
The arithmetic mean is the most common interpretation of "average" in daily language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. It is defined as the sum of all numbers in a dataset divided by the total number of numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. This definition is a human-constructed concept found to be useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.

For the plant height data set (4, 3, 1, 6, 1, 7) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>, with six data points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>:
$$
\frac{4 + 3 + 1 + 6 + 1 + 7}{6} = \frac{22}{6} = 3 \frac{4}{6} = 3 \frac{2}{3} \approx 3.6\overline{6}
$$
The arithmetic mean is approximately 3.67 inches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>.

### Median
The median is the literal middle number in a dataset once all numbers have been ordered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.

To find the median for the plant heights (4, 3, 1, 6, 1, 7) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>:
1.  Order the data: 1, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>.
2.  Since there is an even number of data points (six), there are two middle numbers: 3 and 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>.
3.  The median is the arithmetic mean of these two middle numbers, or halfway between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>: $(3+4)/2 = 3.5$.
The median is 3.5 inches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>.

If there is an odd number of data points, the median is simply the single middle number. For example, in the dataset 0, 7, 50, 10000, 1000000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>, with five numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>, the median is 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>. The median is particularly useful when a dataset contains extreme values that could skew the arithmetic mean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>.

### Mode
The mode is the most common number in a dataset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>. If all numbers appear with equal frequency, or if there isn't a single most common number, then there is no mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>.

For the plant height data set (4, 3, 1, 6, 1, 7) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>:
*   The number 1 appears twice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>.
*   Other numbers (3, 4, 6, 7) appear only once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>.
Therefore, the mode is 1 inch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>. The mode can also be useful in situations where one number appears significantly more often than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>.

These different measures provide varying perspectives on the "typical" or "central" value of a dataset and are suitable for different analytical purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>.

Statistics is fundamentally a method for comprehending and interpreting data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The field is entirely centered around data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

The journey into statistics often begins with [[Descriptive statistics | descriptive statistics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This involves summarizing a large dataset with a smaller collection of numbers without presenting all the original data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Once a foundation in [[Descriptive statistics | descriptive statistics]] is established, the next step is [[Descriptive statistics | inferential statistics]], where one begins to draw conclusions, make judgments, and infer information about the data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Measures of Central Tendency

To describe a dataset, one often seeks a single number that can represent the entire collection of data points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This single number could represent a "typical" value, a "middle" value, the "most frequent" value, or the "center" of all numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This concept is a core part of [[Descriptive statistics | descriptive statistics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

The idea of "average" serves as a starting point for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. While in everyday language "average" often refers specifically to the arithmetic mean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, in statistics, "average" is a broader term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. It refers to a "typical" or "middle" number, or more broadly, a measure of **central tendency** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. There are several types of averages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>:

### Arithmetic Mean
The arithmetic mean is a human-constructed definition that has proven useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. It is calculated as the sum of all numbers in a dataset divided by the total count of numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

```
Arithmetic Mean = (Sum of all numbers) / (Number of numbers)
```

**Example Data Set**: Plant heights (inches): 4, 3, 1, 6, 1, 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>

The sum of the heights is 4 + 3 + 1 + 6 + 1 + 7 = 22 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
There are 6 data points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
Arithmetic Mean = 22 / 6 = 3 and 4/6 = 3 and 2/3 (or 3.6 repeating) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

### Median
The median is the literal middle number in a dataset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. To find the median, the numbers must first be ordered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

**Example Data Set (Ordered)**: Plant heights (inches): 1, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

*   If there is an even number of data points (e.g., six numbers in the example), there will be two middle numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. In this case, the middle numbers are 3 and 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. The median is found by taking the arithmetic mean of these two middle numbers, which is halfway between them: (3 + 4) / 2 = 3.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   If there is an odd number of data points, it is easier to find the median <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. For example, in the ordered dataset: 0, 7, 50, 10,000, 1,000,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>, there are five numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. The middle number is 50, as it is greater than two numbers and less than two numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

### Mode
The mode is the most common number in a dataset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. If all numbers are represented equally, or if there isn't a single most common number, then there is no mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

**Example Data Set**: Plant heights (inches): 4, 3, 1, 6, 1, 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>

In this set, the number 1 appears twice, while all other numbers (3, 4, 6, 7) appear only once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
The mode is 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

## Utility of Different Measures

Each measure of central tendency provides a different way to represent a typical, middle, or central value of a dataset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. They are useful in different contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>:
*   The **arithmetic mean** is used very frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
*   The **median** is particularly useful when a dataset contains extreme values (outliers) that could significantly skew the arithmetic mean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   The **mode** can also be valuable in situations with outliers, especially if one number appears significantly more frequently than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

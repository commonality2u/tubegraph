[[Introduction to Geometry | Area]] is a measure of how much space a two-dimensional figure occupies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. It can be visualized by determining how many 1-by-1 squares can fit within the figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. A 1-by-1 square is a square where each side has a length of 1 unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

The notation used to denote the area of a figure is often by placing the figure's name within brackets, such as `[ABCD]` for the area of rectangle ABCD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

## Area of a Rectangle

A rectangle is a four-sided figure with four right angles, where opposite sides are equal in length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

To find the area of a rectangle, you can multiply one dimension (e.g., length) by the other dimension (e.g., width) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

### Example: Rectangle ABCD

Consider a rectangle ABCD where side AB is 7 units long and side BC is 5 units long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

To find the area of rectangle ABCD, you can envision fitting 1-by-1 squares inside it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   You can fit 7 squares along the length (AB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
*   You can fit 5 squares along the width (BC), creating 5 rows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

The total number of 1-by-1 squares that can fit is the product of the number of squares in each dimension: 5 rows multiplied by 7 columns, which equals 35 total squares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

```
Area of ABCD = Length × Width
Area of ABCD = 7 × 5
Area of ABCD = 35
```

For instance, a rectangle with dimensions 1/2 by 2 would have an area of 1/2 multiplied by 2, resulting in an area of 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

## Area of a Square

A square is a special type of rectangle where all four sides are equal in length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

To find the area of a square, you multiply its length by its width, which are the same value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. This is why it's called "squaring" a number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

### Example: Square XYZS

If a square XYZS has one side length of 2 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>, then all its sides are 2 units long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

```
Area of XYZS = Side × Side
Area of XYZS = 2 × 2
Area of XYZS = 4
```

This means that 4 1-by-1 squares can easily fit onto a 2-by-2 square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

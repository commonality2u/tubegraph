The [[mean_and_central_tendency | mean]] is a common measure of [[central_tendency_in_statistics | central tendency]] in statistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. When someone simply refers to "the mean," they are generally talking about what is typically known as the average in everyday language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This specific type of mean is also known as the [[arithmetic_mean | arithmetic mean]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. It's important to note that there are other ways to calculate a mean, though they are not discussed here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Calculation of the Mean

To calculate the [[arithmetic_mean | arithmetic mean]], you sum all the numbers in a dataset and then divide that sum by the total count of numbers in the dataset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

### Example Calculation

Given the numbers: 23, 29, 20, 32, 23, 21, 33, 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>

1.  **Sum the numbers**:
    23 + 29 + 20 + 32 + 23 + 21 + 33 + 25 = 206 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>
2.  **Count the numbers**:
    There are 8 numbers in the set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
3.  **Divide the sum by the count**:
    206 / 8 = 25.75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>

Thus, the mean for this set of numbers is 25.75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Mean as a Measure of Central Tendency

The [[mean_and_central_tendency | mean]] is considered one way to measure the "center" or [[central_tendency_in_statistics | central tendency]] of a dataset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. It aims to represent the dataset with a single number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Other common measures of [[central_tendency_in_statistics | central tendency]] include the [[median | median]] and the mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. There isn't one "correct" way to define the middle of a dataset, as different measures serve different purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

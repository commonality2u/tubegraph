The word "algebra," especially in association with the ideas it now represents, originates from the title of a significant book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This book, *The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing*, was penned by a Persian mathematician, al-Khwarizmi, around 820 AD while he resided in Baghdad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Etymology of "Algebra"

The term "algebra" is the Arabic word for "restoration" or "completion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Al-Khwarizmi used it in his book to describe the specific operation of moving terms from one side of an equation to the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

The full Arabic title of his work is *Al-kitab al-mukhtasar fihisab al-gabr wa'l-muqabala* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   "Al-kitab" means "book" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   "Al-mukhtasar" is translated as "compendious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   "Fihisab" means "calculation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   "Al-gabr" is the root of "algebra" and means "completion" or "restoration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   "Wa'l-muqabala" translates to "balancing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

Thus, the title translates to "The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Major Contributions to the [[origins_of_algebra | Origins of Algebra]]

The history of [[introduction_to_algebra | algebra]] involves contributions from various civilizations and mathematicians over millennia.

### Ancient Babylon (c. 2000 BCE)
The earliest known records of people exploring [[algebraic methods in algebra | algebraic ideas]] come from ancient Babylon, around 2000 years before the Common Era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Stone tablets from this period suggest that Babylonians were working on fundamental [[algebraic methods in algebra | ideas of algebra]], even though they did not use the same symbols or numerical representations we use today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Babylon was part of Mesopotamia, a region between two rivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

### Diophantus (c. 200-300 AD)
Around 200 to 300 AD, a Greek mathematician named Diophantus, who lived in Alexandria (then part of the Roman Empire), made significant contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Diophantus is sometimes considered the "father of [[introduction_to_algebra | algebra]]" by Western historians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. However, his work focused more on specific problems rather than the abstract approach seen later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

### Brahmagupta (c. 600 AD)
Around 600 AD, another notable mathematician, Brahmagupta, emerged in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. He also made significant contributions to the field of [[brahmaguptas_influence_on_algebra | algebra]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

### Al-Khwarizmi (c. 820 AD)
Al-Khwarizmi, living in Baghdad in the 8th or 9th century (specifically 820 AD), is widely credited with the naming of [[introduction_to_algebra | algebra]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. His book is considered foundational because it was not only the first to use the word "algebra" but also the first to present many of its modern ideas, such as balancing equations and approaching problems in an abstract manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. He is often considered one of the "fathers of [[introduction_to_algebra | algebra]]" for thinking about it in the abstract sense, similar to how modern mathematicians approach the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

While the Babylonians, Diophantus, and Brahmagupta made unique contributions, al-Khwarizmi's work significantly shaped the modern understanding and terminology of [[introduction_to_algebra | algebra]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

The [[understanding_the_concept_of_slope | slope]] of a line indicates how steep it is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. For a straight line, the [[consistency_in_calculating_slope | slope]] remains [[consistency_in_calculating_slope | constant]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Definition and Formula

[[understanding_the_concept_of_slope | Slope]] is defined as the [[understanding_slope_as_change_in_y_over_change_in_x | change in y over change in x]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This can be written using the capital delta ($\Delta$) symbol, which means "change in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>:

> Slope = $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>

## Calculating Slope from a Graph

To [[finding_the_slope_of_a_line | find the slope of a line]] from a graph, you can choose any two distinct points on the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. It's often easiest to select points with integer coordinates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

### Steps:

1.  **Select Two Points**: Pick two points on the line. For example, let's start with a point that's easy to read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
2.  **Determine Change in X ($\Delta x$)**: Count the horizontal distance (right for positive, left for negative) between the two points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
3.  **Determine Change in Y ($\Delta y$)**: Count the vertical distance (up for positive, down for negative) between the two points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
4.  **Calculate Slope**: Divide the [[understanding_slope_as_change_in_y_over_change_in_x | change in y by the change in x]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

### Example 1

Consider a line passing through the points (-3, -3) and (0, -1).

*   **Change in X ($\Delta x$)**: Moving from x = -3 to x = 0, the horizontal change is 3 units to the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. So, $\Delta x = 3$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Change in Y ($\Delta y$)**: Moving from y = -3 to y = -1, the vertical change is 2 units up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. So, $\Delta y = 2$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   **Slope**: $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{2}{3}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

### Example 2 (Demonstrating Consistency)

The [[consistency_in_calculating_slope | slope]] will be the same regardless of which two points you choose on the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Let's use points (3, 1) and (-3, -3) for the same line.

If we start at (3, 1) and move to (-3, -3):

*   **Change in Y ($\Delta y$)**: Moving from y = 1 to y = -3, the vertical change is 4 units down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. So, $\Delta y = -4$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Change in X ($\Delta x$)**: Moving from x = 3 to x = -3, the horizontal change is 6 units to the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. So, $\Delta x = -6$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   **Slope**: $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{-4}{-6}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
    The negatives cancel out, resulting in $\frac{4}{6}$, which simplifies to $\frac{2}{3}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

The key is to be [[consistency_in_calculating_slope | consistent]] in your direction when calculating $\Delta x$ and $\Delta y$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. If you define one point as the "start" and another as the "end," always subtract the start coordinates from the end coordinates for both x and y. Regardless of the points chosen, the [[Slope of a Straight Line | slope]] for a straight line will always be the same value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

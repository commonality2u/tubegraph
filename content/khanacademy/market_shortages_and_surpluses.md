In a given market, such as the apple market, [[supply_and_demand_curves | supply and demand curves]] illustrate how prices affect both the quantity consumers wish to purchase and the quantity producers are willing to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This relationship is often visualized on a graph where the vertical axis represents price per pound, and the horizontal axis represents the quantity of apples in thousands of pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Demand and Supply Curves

The demand curve shows that if the price of apples is very high, the quantity demanded by consumers will be low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. For instance, at $5 per pound, the [[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] might only be 500 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Conversely, at a lower price like $1 per pound, the [[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] could increase to 4,000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. It's important to distinguish between [[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] (a specific amount at a specific price) and [[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | demand]] (the entire relationship between price and quantity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This creates a downward-sloping [[demand_schedule_and_demand_curve | demand curve]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

The supply curve, representing all suppliers in the market, indicates the quantity producers are willing to provide at different prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. There is a minimum price below which producers are not willing to supply apples, for example, 50 cents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. As the price increases, producers are willing to supply more apples; at $1, they might supply 1,000 pounds, and at higher prices, the quantity supplied increases further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This results in an upward-sloping supply curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## Market Shortages

A market shortage occurs when the [[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] exceeds the quantity supplied at a particular price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

### Scenario: Low Initial Price
If apple suppliers anticipate selling apples at $1 per pound and only supply 1,000 pounds based on their supply curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, a shortage will arise. At this price, the [[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] is 4,000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. This creates a shortage of 3,000 pounds of apples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

### Market Response to Shortage
In a situation of shortage, consumers will likely "bid up" the price of apples because there are many people who want apples but only a limited supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. As prices rise, producers are incentivized to increase the quantity they produce and supply, moving up along their supply curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Simultaneously, as prices increase, the [[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] by consumers will decrease, moving up along their [[demand_schedule_and_demand_curve | demand curve]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. These [[price_adjustments_and_market_dynamics | price adjustments]] and changes in [[consumer_and_producer_behavior_in_response_to_price_changes | consumer and producer behavior]] naturally work to reduce the shortage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

## Market Surpluses

A market surplus occurs when the quantity supplied exceeds the [[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] at a particular price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

### Scenario: High Initial Price
If suppliers set a high price, such as $3 per pound, hoping to sell a large quantity, they might produce 3,000 pounds of apples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. However, at this high price, the [[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] might be much lower, perhaps 1,300 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. This results in a surplus of 1,700 pounds of apples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

### Market Response to Surplus
In a surplus situation, especially with perishable goods like apples, producers may become "desperate" to sell their excess stock before it spoils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. They will start reducing the price to attract consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. As prices decrease, producers will also reduce the quantity they supply, moving down along their supply curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Concurrently, as prices fall, the [[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] by consumers will increase, moving down along their [[demand_schedule_and_demand_curve | demand curve]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. These [[price_adjustments_and_market_dynamics | price adjustments]] and changes in [[consumer_and_producer_behavior_in_response_to_price_changes | consumer and producer behavior]] help to eliminate the surplus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

## Equilibrium Price and Quantity

The natural adjustments from shortages (prices rising) and surpluses (prices falling) lead the market towards a specific point where the [[supply_and_demand_curves | supply and demand curves]] intersect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

This intersection represents the [[Equilibrium price and quantity | equilibrium price]] and [[Equilibrium price and quantity | equilibrium quantity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. The [[Equilibrium price and quantity | equilibrium price]] is the price at which the quantity supplied is exactly equal to the [[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. For the apple market example, this might be around $2.15 per pound, resulting in an [[Equilibrium price and quantity | equilibrium quantity]] of approximately 2,200 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. At this point, all apples produced are sold, and none go to waste, creating a stable and favorable scenario for both consumers and producers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

In any given market, such as the [[supply_and_demand_curves_for_apples | apple market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, understanding the interplay between demand and supply is crucial for determining how prices and quantities adjust over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The horizontal axis of a market graph represents the quantity of apples, while the vertical axis represents the price per pound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Prices can range from $1 to $5 a pound, and quantities from 1000 to 5000 pounds per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Demand and Supply Curves

The **demand curve** illustrates consumer behavior: if the price of apples is high, consumers will demand less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. For example, at $5 a pound, the quantity demanded might be around 500 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Conversely, at a lower price like $1 a pound, the quantity demanded could be 4000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. It's important to distinguish between "demand" (the entire relationship) and "quantity demanded" (a specific quantity at a specific price) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

The **supply curve** shows producer behavior: below a certain price (e.g., $0.50), producers may not even be willing to produce apples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. As the price increases, the quantity producers are willing to supply also increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. For example, at $1, suppliers might be willing to supply 1000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## Market Shortage

A market experiences a shortage when the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied at a given price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

### Example Scenario: Price too Low
If suppliers initially set the price at $1 per pound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>:
*   The **quantity supplied** based on their plan would be 1000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:02">[03:02:02]</a>.
*   However, the **quantity demanded** at $1 per pound is 4000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.
*   This results in a **shortage** of 3000 pounds of apples (4000 - 1000) at that price point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.

### Market Adjustment to Shortage
In a situation of shortage, several things naturally begin to happen:
*   **Price Increases:** Consumers, eager to buy apples, will start bidding up the price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.
*   **Quantity Supplied Increases:** As prices rise, producers are incentivized to increase the quantity they produce, moving up along the supply curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.
*   **Quantity Demanded Decreases:** Simultaneously, as the price increases, the quantity demanded by consumers will start to decrease, moving up along the demand curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>.
*   This adjustment helps the market move away from the shortage situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.

## Market Surplus

A market experiences a surplus when the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded at a given price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>.

### Example Scenario: Price too High
If suppliers set the price high, perhaps at $3 per pound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>:
*   The **quantity supplied** at $3 per pound would be 3000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>.
*   However, the **quantity demanded** at $3 per pound is much lower, appearing to be about 1300 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>.
*   This creates a **surplus** of 1700 pounds of apples (3000 - 1300) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>.

### Market Adjustment to Surplus
In a situation of surplus, the following adjustments occur:
*   **Price Decreases:** Since apples won't last forever, producers become desperate and start reducing prices to attract consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:40]</a>.
*   **Quantity Supplied Decreases:** As prices fall and unsold inventory accumulates, producers will reduce the quantity they produce, moving down along the supply curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>.
*   **Quantity Demanded Increases:** As the price decreases, the quantity demanded by consumers will increase, moving down along the demand curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>.

## [[equilibrium_price_and_quantity | Equilibrium Price and Quantity]]

Both shortages and surpluses naturally push the market towards a specific point where the demand and supply curves intersect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>. This point represents market [[equilibrium_price_and_quantity | equilibrium]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>.

*   The **[[equilibrium_price_and_quantity | equilibrium price]]** is the price at which the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>. In the apple market example, this is approximately $2.15 per pound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>.
*   The **[[equilibrium_price_and_quantity | equilibrium quantity]]** is the specific quantity where supply meets demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:00">[09:45:00]</a>. For apples, this looks to be about 2200 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>.

At [[equilibrium_price_and_quantity | equilibrium]], assuming no other changes, the market is stable: all apples produced are sold, and none go to waste, benefiting both consumers and producers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:03]</a>.

## Introduction to [[basics_of_trigonometry | Trigonometry]]
[[basics_of_trigonometry | Trigonometry]] may sound complicated, but it is fundamentally the study of the ratios of sides of triangles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The word "trig" literally means "triangle," and "metry" means "measure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## [[right_triangles_and_trigonometry | Right Triangles]] Basics
[[basics_of_trigonometry | Trigonometry]], as introduced here, primarily focuses on [[right_triangles_and_trigonometry | right triangles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. A [[right_triangles_and_trigonometry | right triangle]] is defined by having one angle that measures 90 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

### Hypotenuse
In a [[right_triangles_and_trigonometry | right triangle]], the **hypotenuse** is:
*   The side opposite the 90-degree angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   The longest side of a [[right_triangles_and_trigonometry | right triangle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   Only present in a [[right_triangles_and_trigonometry | right triangle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### Pythagorean Theorem
The sides of a [[right_triangles_and_trigonometry | right triangle]] satisfy the Pythagorean theorem: the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides (legs) equals the square of the hypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. For example, in a 3-4-5 [[right_triangles_and_trigonometry | right triangle]], `3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Core [[introduction_to_basic_trigonometric_functions | Trigonometric Functions]]
The [[introduction_to_basic_trigonometric_functions | core trigonometric functions]] are [[sine_cosine_and_tangent_functions | sine]], [[sine_cosine_and_tangent_functions | cosine]], and [[sine_cosine_and_tangent_functions | tangent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. They are commonly abbreviated as `sin`, `cos`, and `tan` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. These functions specify the ratios of certain sides for any given angle within a triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

### [[trigonometric_ratios_and_soh_cah_toa_mnemonic | SOH CAH TOA Mnemonic]]
A useful mnemonic to remember the definitions of these functions is [[trigonometric_ratios_and_soh_cah_toa_mnemonic | SOH CAH TOA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>:

*   **SOH**: **S**ine = **O**pposite / **H**ypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>
*   **CAH**: **C**osine = **A**djacent / **H**ypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>
*   **TOA**: **T**angent = **O**pposite / **A**djacent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>

## Identifying Sides Relative to an Angle
To apply [[trigonometric_ratios_and_soh_cah_toa_mnemonic | SOH CAH TOA]], it's crucial to correctly identify the opposite, adjacent, and hypotenuse sides relative to the specific angle being considered.

*   **Hypotenuse**: Always the side opposite the 90-degree angle, and the longest side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Its identification does not change based on which acute angle is chosen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   **Opposite Side**: The side directly across from the angle you are focusing on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   **Adjacent Side**: The side next to the angle you are focusing on that is *not* the hypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. It's one of the sides that forms the angle's vertex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

It is important to note that the "opposite" and "adjacent" sides change depending on which acute angle in the [[right_triangles_and_trigonometry | right triangle]] you are referring to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

## Calculating [[trigonometric_ratios_and_angle_identification | Trigonometric Ratios]] (Examples)
Let's consider a [[right_triangles_and_trigonometry | right triangle]] with sides 3, 4, and 5.

```
      /|
     / |
    /  | 3 (opposite to theta, adjacent to x)
   /   |
  /    |
 /_____|
4 (adjacent to theta, opposite to x)
```
The hypotenuse is 5.

### Example 1: Angle Theta
Let's define `theta` (θ) as the angle between the side of length 4 and the side of length 5 (the hypotenuse) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

*   **Opposite** side to θ: 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>
*   **Adjacent** side to θ: 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>
*   **Hypotenuse**: 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>

Using [[trigonometric_ratios_and_soh_cah_toa_mnemonic | SOH CAH TOA]]:
*   **Sine of θ (sin θ)** = Opposite / Hypotenuse = 3 / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>
*   **Cosine of θ (cos θ)** = Adjacent / Hypotenuse = 4 / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>
*   **Tangent of θ (tan θ)** = Opposite / Adjacent = 3 / 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>

### Example 2: Angle X
Now, let's define `x` as the angle between the side of length 3 and the side of length 5 (the hypotenuse) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

*   **Opposite** side to x: 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>
*   **Adjacent** side to x: 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>
*   **Hypotenuse**: 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>

Using [[trigonometric_ratios_and_soh_cah_toa_mnemonic | SOH CAH TOA]]:
*   **Sine of x (sin x)** = Opposite / Hypotenuse = 4 / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>
*   **Cosine of x (cos x)** = Adjacent / Hypotenuse = 3 / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>
*   **Tangent of x (tan x)** = Opposite / Adjacent = 4 / 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>

Notice how the opposite and adjacent sides swap roles when moving from angle θ to angle x, leading to different trigonometric ratios.

## Future Considerations
The [[trigonometric_ratios_and_soh_cah_toa_mnemonic | SOH CAH TOA]] definitions are highly effective for angles between 0 and 90 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. For angles outside this range (e.g., greater than 90 degrees), a more generalized definition of [[sine_cosine_and_tangent_functions | sine]], [[sine_cosine_and_tangent_functions | cosine]], and [[sine_cosine_and_tangent_functions | tangent]] is introduced, derived from these basic concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

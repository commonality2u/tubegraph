The journey of [[lifelong_learning | learning]] begins at birth, with individuals starting at a baseline of zero knowledge and ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Initially, no one can talk, walk, or perform complex tasks like algebra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Basic skills such as [[introduction_to_basic_addition | adding]], reading, writing, or riding a bike are not innate; everyone must learn them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Even renowned figures like Albert Einstein had to learn to count to ten, and William Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs, just like everyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## The Learning Process

Humans are inherently designed to learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This process is gradual and often involves stumbling, slipping, crawling, falling, and experiencing failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. It can be frustrating and confusing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. However, persistent effort leads to breakthroughs, such as learning to walk one foot in front of the other, or building one idea upon the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

### The Role of Failure

Every incorrect answer or mistake contributes to strengthening the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Failing is merely another term for growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The continuous process of trying and persevering is fundamental to learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Foundations of Knowledge

The most intricate and profound concepts in the universe are constructed upon fundamental ideas that are accessible and understandable to anyone, anywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Regardless of an individual's background or location, the core principle remains: anyone can learn anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

[[Solving equations with variables | Solving a more involved equation]] often requires isolating the variable, such as 'x' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This means getting the variable alone on one side of the equation, resulting in a solution like "x equals something" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Once isolated, the equation is solved, and the answer can be checked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

The fundamental principle for isolating a variable is to perform [[operations_on_both_sides_of_an_equation | operations on both sides of the equation]] to maintain equality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Visualizing the equation can help understand why certain operations are allowed and make the process more intuitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Example: Solving `2x + 3 = 5x - 2`

Consider the equation `2x + 3 = 5x - 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This equation has 'x' on both sides and involves addition and subtraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

### Step 1: [[Combining like terms in equations | Combine Variable Terms]]

The first step is to gather all the variable terms onto one side of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

*   To do this, subtract `2x` from both sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
    *   On the left side, `2x + 3 - 2x` simplifies to `3` (the `2x` terms cancel out) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
    *   On the right side, `5x - 2 - 2x` simplifies to `3x - 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   The equation becomes `3 = 3x - 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

### Step 2: Eliminate Constant Terms from Variable Side

Next, move the constant terms away from the side containing the variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

*   To eliminate the `-2` on the right side, add `2` to both sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
    *   On the left side, `3 + 2` equals `5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
    *   On the right side, `3x - 2 + 2` simplifies to `3x` (the `2`s cancel out) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   The equation now is `5 = 3x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

### Step 3: Solve for the Variable

The final step is to isolate 'x' by addressing its coefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

*   Since 'x' is being multiplied by `3` (its coefficient), [[dividing_both_sides_of_an_equation | divide both sides]] by `3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
    *   On the left side, `5 / 3` is `5/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
    *   On the right side, `3x / 3` simplifies to `x` (the `3`s cancel out) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   The solution is `5/3 = x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

### Expressing the Solution

The solution `5/3 = x` is completely equivalent to `x = 5/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. This fractional answer can also be expressed as a mixed number: `1 2/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

> [!TIP]
> You can always substitute the derived value of 'x' back into the original equation to verify that it works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

[[glycolysis | Glycolysis]] is a crucial biochemical pathway present in nearly all forms of life, focusing on breaking down glucose as a fuel source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The [[glycolysis_process_and_outcomes | process]] involves breaking glucose (a six-carbon molecule) into two pyruvate molecules (each a three-carbon molecule) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This yields a net production of two ATP molecules and the [[reduction_of_nad_to_nadh_in_glycolysis | reduction of NAD to NADH]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## Net ATP Yield
Directly from [[glycolysis | glycolysis]], there is a net production of two ATP molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Although four ATPs are produced, two ATPs are consumed during the initial stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, resulting in a net gain of two ATPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Investment Phase
The initial stages of [[glycolysis | glycolysis]] are known as the [[investment_and_payoff_phases_of_glycolysis | investment phase]], where ATP is consumed to prepare the glucose molecule for cleavage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
1.  **First ATP Consumption**: Glucose is phosphorylated, utilizing one ATP molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. This reaction is facilitated by the enzyme hexokinase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
2.  **Second ATP Consumption**: After an isomerization step, another ATP molecule is used to phosphorylate fructose 6-phosphate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. This step is catalyzed by phosphofructokinase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
    *   *Total ATP consumed in investment phase:* 2 ATPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

## Payoff Phase
Following the investment phase, the six-carbon molecule, now phosphorylated at two positions, is broken down into two three-carbon molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. From this point, the reactions effectively occur twice for each initial glucose molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. This is the [[investment_and_payoff_phases_of_glycolysis | payoff phase]], where ATP is produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
1.  **First ATP Production**: Two ATP molecules are produced when a phosphate group is removed from 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (derived from glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. This reaction is catalyzed by phosphoglycerate kinase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
2.  **Second ATP Production**: Two additional ATP molecules are generated as phosphoenolpyruvate is converted to pyruvate, facilitated by pyruvate kinase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
    *   *Total ATP produced in payoff phase:* 4 ATPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Role of NADH
Beyond direct ATP production, [[glycolysis | glycolysis]] also involves the [[reduction_of_nad_to_nadh_in_glycolysis | reduction of NAD+ to NADH]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. This happens twice per glucose molecule, resulting in two NADH molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. These NADH molecules can then be oxidized in the [[electron_transport_chain_and_atp_production | electron transport chain]] during oxidative phosphorylation to yield even more ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

While [[glycolysis | glycolysis]] provides a direct, albeit small, ATP yield, its products (pyruvate and NADH) are crucial for further ATP generation in subsequent stages of [[energy_efficiency_and_atp_yield_of_cellular_respiration | cellular respiration]] if oxygen is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

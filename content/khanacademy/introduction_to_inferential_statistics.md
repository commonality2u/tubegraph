[[introduction_to_statistics | Statistics]] broadly involves understanding data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a> and can be classified into several categories, including [[descriptive_statistics | descriptive statistics]] and [[probability_in_inferential_statistics | inferential statistics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## What is Inferential Statistics?

[[probability_in_inferential_statistics | Inferential statistics]] is the process of using data to draw conclusions about broader phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This often involves taking sampled data from a larger group (a population) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a> and then performing mathematical operations on that sample to make [[probability_in_inferential_statistics | inferences]] or conclusions about the entire population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### Samples vs. Populations

A key distinction in [[probability_in_inferential_statistics | inferential statistics]] is between a "sample" and a "population" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Population** refers to the entire group one wishes to study.
*   **Sample** refers to a smaller, representative subset of that population from which data is collected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

For example, if surveying people who will vote for president, surveying only three individuals means collecting data from a sample, not the entire population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The goal of [[probability_in_inferential_statistics | inferential statistics]] in this scenario would be to use the sample's data to understand the voting patterns of the entire population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

> "What inferential statistics are all about are if we can do some math on the samples, maybe we can make inferences or conclusions about the population as a whole." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>

While [[descriptive_statistics | descriptive statistics]] focuses on summarizing a dataset without generalizing beyond it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, [[probability_in_inferential_statistics | inferential statistics]] extends this by allowing predictions and generalizations about a larger group based on smaller observations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

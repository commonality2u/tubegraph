[[rational_numbers_and_integer_representation | Rational expressions]] are algebraic expressions that are essentially the same concept as [[rational_numbers_and_integer_representation | rational numbers]], but instead of having numbers in the numerator and denominator, they involve expressions with variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:10">[01:10:10]</a>.

## Simplifying Rational Expressions

The process of [[simplifying_expressions | simplifying rational expressions]] is analogous to putting [[rational_numbers_and_integer_representation | fractions]] in their lowest terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:10">[01:04:10]</a>. This involves factoring both the numerator and the denominator to identify and cancel out common factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.

### Core Idea

When simplifying a fraction like 3/6, we recognize that 3 and 6 share a common factor of 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. By writing 6 as 2 × 3, we can cancel the common factor of 3, leaving 1/2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. Similarly, for 8/24, it simplifies to 1/3 by canceling the common factor of 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. This same principle applies to rational expressions, even when the common factor is a variable expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

### Examples

#### Example 1: Factoring Common Monomials

To simplify an expression like `(9x + 3) / (12x + 4)`:
1.  Factor the numerator: `3(3x + 1)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.
2.  Factor the denominator: `4(3x + 1)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.
3.  The common factor `(3x + 1)` can be cancelled out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.
4.  The simplified expression is `3/4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

#### Example 2: Factoring Differences of Squares

Consider `(x² - 9) / (5x + 15)`:
1.  Factor the numerator using the [[understanding_quadratic_expressions | difference of squares]] formula: `(x + 3)(x - 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.
2.  Factor the denominator: `5(x + 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.
3.  Cancel the common factor `(x + 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.
4.  The simplified expression is `(x - 3) / 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.

#### Example 3: Factoring Trinomials

To simplify `(x² + 6x + 5) / (x² - x - 2)`:
1.  Factor the numerator: `(x + 5)(x + 1)` (find two numbers that multiply to 5 and add to 6: 5 and 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.
2.  Factor the denominator: `(x - 2)(x + 1)` (find two numbers that multiply to -2 and add to -1: -2 and 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>.
3.  Cancel the common factor `(x + 1)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>.
4.  The simplified expression is `(x + 5) / (x - 2)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>.

#### Example 4: Factoring by Grouping (for [[understanding_quadratic_expressions | quadratic expressions]] with leading coefficients)

To simplify `(3x² + 3x - 18) / (2x² + 5x - 3)`:
1.  **Factor the numerator `3x² + 3x - 18`:**
    *   Look for two numbers that multiply to (3 * -18) = -54 and add to 3. These are 9 and -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>.
    *   Rewrite `3x` as `9x - 6x`: `3x² + 9x - 6x - 18` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>.
    *   Group terms: `(3x² + 9x) + (-6x - 18)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>.
    *   Factor out common terms from each group: `3x(x + 3) - 6(x + 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>.
    *   Factor out the common binomial: `(3x - 6)(x + 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12:00">[10:12:00]</a>.
2.  **Factor the denominator `2x² + 5x - 3`:**
    *   Look for two numbers that multiply to (2 * -3) = -6 and add to 5. These are 6 and -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>.
    *   Rewrite `5x` as `6x - x`: `2x² + 6x - x - 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:28:00">[13:28:00]</a>.
    *   Group terms: `(2x² + 6x) + (-x - 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:00">[13:53:00]</a>.
    *   Factor out common terms: `2x(x + 3) - 1(x + 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:57:00">[13:57:00]</a>.
    *   Factor out the common binomial: `(2x - 1)(x + 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11:00">[14:11:00]</a>.
3.  **Combine and Simplify:**
    *   The original expression becomes `(3x - 6)(x + 3) / (2x - 1)(x + 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:28:00">[14:28:00]</a>.
    *   Cancel the common factor `(x + 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>.
    *   The simplified expression is `(3x - 6) / (2x - 1)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:02:00">[15:02:00]</a>.

## Domain Restrictions

When [[simplifying_expressions | simplifying rational expressions]], it's crucial to remember that the simplified expression is only truly an [[understanding_equivalent_expressions_in_algebra | equivalent expression]] to the original one if the domain restrictions are maintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. This means excluding any values of the variable that would make the original denominator equal to zero, as this would make the expression undefined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.

For example:
*   In `(x² - 9) / (5x + 15)`, the original denominator `5(x + 3)` would be zero if `x = -3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. Therefore, even though the simplified form `(x - 3) / 5` is defined at `x = -3`, the condition `x ≠ -3` must be explicitly stated for the expressions to be truly [[understanding_equivalent_expressions_in_algebra | equivalent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.
*   Similarly, for `(9x + 3) / (12x + 4)`, the original denominator `4(3x + 1)` would be zero if `x = -1/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>. Thus, the simplified form `3/4` must include the condition `x ≠ -1/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.
*   In the case of `(x² + 6x + 5) / (x² - x - 2)`, the common factor `(x + 1)` means `x ≠ -1` must be excluded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>.
*   For `(3x² + 3x - 18) / (2x² + 5x - 3)`, the common factor `(x + 3)` indicates `x ≠ -3` must be excluded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47:00">[14:47:00]</a>.

These excluded values represent "holes" in the graph of the rational expression if it were plotted as a function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.

In mathematics, while basic arithmetic deals with concrete numbers like 23 + 5, where the values are known and calculable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, algebra introduces the concept of variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## What are Variables?
Variables are values within expressions that can change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Their value depends on the context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Expressions vs. Equations
It's important to understand the distinction between an expression and an equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

### Expressions
An expression is a statement of value or quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. The value of an expression changes based on the value of its variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

*   **Example 1: `x + 5`**
    *   If `x` equals 1, then `x + 5` evaluates to 1 + 5 = 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
    *   If `x` equals -7, then `x + 5` evaluates to -7 + 5 = -2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   **Example 2: `y + z`**
    *   If `y` equals 1 and `z` equals 2, it evaluates to 1 + 2 = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **Example 3: `x^y`**
    *   If `x` equals 5 and `y` equals 2, it evaluates to 5^2 = 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
    *   If `x` equals -2 and `y` equals 3, it evaluates to (-2)^3 = -8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   **Example 4: `sqrt(x + y) - x`**
    *   If `x` equals 1 and `y` equals 8, the expression becomes `sqrt(1 + 8) - 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
    *   `sqrt(9) - 1` = `3 - 1` = 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

### Equations
An equation involves setting two expressions equal to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. This "equating" action constrains the value a variable can take <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

*   **Example 1: `x + 3 = 1`**
    *   In this equation, `x` must be -2 because -2 + 3 equals 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This is an example of [[solving_simple_linear_equations | solving a simple linear equation]].
*   **Example 2: `x + y + z = 5`**
    *   This equation has multiple unknowns. If `y` is given as 3 and `z` as 2, then the equation becomes `x + 3 + 2 = 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
    *   This simplifies to `x + 5 = 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
    *   To satisfy the equation, `x` would have to be 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

In summary, a variable's value can change depending on whether it's part of an expression or an equation, and what other values or constraints are present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

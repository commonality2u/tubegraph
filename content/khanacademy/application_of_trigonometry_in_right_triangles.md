## Introduction to [[introduction_to_trigonometry | Trigonometry]]

[[introduction_to_trigonometry | Trigonometry]], derived from Ancient Greek, is understood to mean "triangle measure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Fundamentally, [[introduction_to_basic_trigonometry | basic trigonometry]] is the study of [[right_triangles_and_their_properties | right triangles]] and the relationships between their sides and angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. It helps in understanding what various buttons on a calculator, like "sin," "cos," and "tan," actually do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## [[understanding_right_triangles | Understanding Right Triangles]]

A [[understanding_right_triangles | right triangle]] is a triangle that contains a right angle (90 degrees) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. For illustrative purposes, consider a right triangle with side lengths 3, 4, and a hypotenuse of 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The hypotenuse is always the longest side and is found opposite the right angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>, a concept familiar from [[applying_the_pythagorean_theorem | applying the Pythagorean Theorem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

## [[trigonometric_functions_and_their_definitions | Trigonometric Functions]]

[[trigonometric_functions_and_their_definitions | Trigonometric functions]] express the ratios of the sides of a triangle relative to a specific angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. The common angle symbol used in trigonometry is theta (θ), a Greek letter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

### The SOH CAH TOA Mnemonic

To remember the definitions of sine, cosine, and tangent, the mnemonic **SOH CAH TOA** is commonly used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>:

*   **SOH**: **S**ine = **O**pposite / **H**ypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>
*   **CAH**: **C**osine = **A**djacent / **H**ypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>
*   **TOA**: **T**angent = **O**pposite / **A**djacent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>

### Calculating Sine

Sine (sin) of an angle is defined as the ratio of the length of the side **opposite** the angle to the length of the **hypotenuse** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

*   **Example**: For an angle θ in a right triangle where the side opposite is 4 and the hypotenuse is 5:
    sin(θ) = Opposite / Hypotenuse = 4 / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

### Calculating Cosine

Cosine (cos) of an angle is defined as the ratio of the length of the side **adjacent** to the angle to the length of the **hypotenuse** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

*   **Example**: For the same angle θ, where the adjacent side is 3 and the hypotenuse is 5:
    cos(θ) = Adjacent / Hypotenuse = 3 / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

### Calculating Tangent

Tangent (tan) of an angle is defined as the ratio of the length of the side **opposite** the angle to the length of the side **adjacent** to the angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

*   **Example**: For the same angle θ, where the opposite side is 4 and the adjacent side is 3:
    tan(θ) = Opposite / Adjacent = 4 / 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

## [[applying_trigonometry_to_different_angles_in_a_triangle | Angle Dependence of Trigonometric Ratios]]

It is crucial to note that the "opposite" and "adjacent" sides are relative to the specific angle being considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

*   **Example**: If another angle in the same triangle, labeled 'x', is considered:
    *   The side opposite angle 'x' would be 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
    *   The side adjacent to angle 'x' would be 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
    *   Therefore, tan(x) = Opposite / Adjacent = 3 / 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

> [!INFO]
> This shows that the tangent of one non-right angle in a right triangle can be the inverse of the tangent of the other non-right angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

## Practical Uses of Trigonometry

Trigonometry enables the calculation of unknown sides or angles within a right triangle if certain information is already known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. For instance, if an angle and a side are known, other sides can be determined. Conversely, if two sides are known, the angles can be figured out using trigonometric tables or calculators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. This capability makes [[applying_trigonometry_to_different_angles_in_a_triangle | trigonometry]] a fundamental tool in various fields.

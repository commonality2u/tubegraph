The immune system is broadly categorized into the [[innate_immune_system_and_first_line_barriers | nonspecific (innate) immune system]] and the [[specific_immune_system_and_lymphocytes | specific (adaptive) immune system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. The [[specific_immune_system_and_lymphocytes | specific immune system]] is an adaptive response that is based on prior exposure to pathogens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.

The main actors in the [[specific_immune_system_and_lymphocytes | specific immune system]] are [[specific_immune_system_and_lymphocytes | lymphocytes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. [[specific_immune_system_and_lymphocytes | Lymphocytes]] are a type of [[role_of_neutrophils_and_other_white_blood_cells | white blood cell]] (leukocyte) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

## T Lymphocytes

[[specific_immune_system_and_lymphocytes | Lymphocytes]] are divided into [[humoral_response_and_b_lymphocytes | B lymphocytes]] (B cells) and T lymphocytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>. T lymphocytes derive their name "T" from the thymus, where they mature after starting in the bone marrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.

T lymphocytes can be further classified into different types, including helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>. Helper T cells have a role in amplifying and activating the [[humoral_response_and_b_lymphocytes | humoral response]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>.

## Cell-Mediated Response

T lymphocytes primarily participate in the cell-mediated response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>. This response is distinct from the [[humoral_response_and_b_lymphocytes | humoral response]], which targets pathogens floating freely in the body's fluids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>.

The cell-mediated response is crucial when viruses or bacteria have already infiltrated and infected cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>. In such cases, the infected cell itself needs to be targeted and destroyed, even if it is one of the body's own cells that is now helping to produce more viruses or has been colonized by bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>. Further details on the cell-mediated response will be discussed in future explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>.

**Completing the Square** is a technique used to [[solving_quadratic_equations|solve quadratic equations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This method is universally applicable to any [[understanding_quadratic_expressions|quadratic equation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a> and forms the fundamental basis for the [[quadratic_formula_introduction|quadratic formula]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The concept builds upon previously discussed methods of [[solving_quadratic_equations|solving quadratics]] that utilize perfect squares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

The core idea behind completing the square is to transform a [[understanding_quadratic_expressions|quadratic equation]] into a perfect square expression by adding and subtracting terms from both sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Methodology

To make the left-hand side of a quadratic equation into a perfect square, particularly in the form of `x² - 2ax + a²`, which equals `(x - a)²`, a specific number needs to be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

The process involves:
1.  Identifying the coefficient of the `x` term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
2.  Taking half of that coefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This value corresponds to `a` (or `-a` if the `x` term is negative) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
3.  Squaring this half-coefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
4.  Adding this squared value to both sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. It's crucial to add the value to both sides to maintain the equality of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

### Example 1: x² - 4x = 5

Consider the equation `x² - 4x = 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
To make `x² - 4x` a perfect square, we look at the coefficient of `x`, which is -4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
1.  Half of -4 is -2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. So, `a` = -2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
2.  Square -2: `(-2)² = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
3.  Add 4 to both sides of the equation:
    `x² - 4x + 4 = 5 + 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>
    `x² - 4x + 4 = 9` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>

Now, the left-hand side is a perfect square: `(x - 2)²` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
So, the equation becomes: `(x - 2)² = 9` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

To [[solving_quadratic_equations|solve]] for `x`:
1.  Take the square root of both sides, remembering the positive and negative roots:
    `x - 2 = ±√9` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>
    `x - 2 = ±3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>
2.  Add 2 to both sides:
    `x = 2 ± 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>

This yields two solutions:
*   `x = 2 + 3 = 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>
*   `x = 2 - 3 = -1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>

> [!NOTE] Comparison with [[factoring_quadratic_equations|Factoring]]
> For this specific problem, [[factoring_quadratic_equations|factoring]] would have been a quicker method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. By rearranging the equation to `x² - 4x - 5 = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, it can be [[factoring_quadratic_polynomials|factored]] into `(x - 5)(x + 1) = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>, leading to `x = 5` or `x = -1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. However, [[solving_difficult_quadratic_equations|completing the square]] is guaranteed to work for *any* quadratic equation, regardless of its coefficients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

### Example 2: 10x² - 30x - 8 = 0 (A More Difficult Case)

Consider the equation `10x² - 30x - 8 = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

1.  **Simplify by dividing by a common factor:** Divide the entire equation by 2 to simplify the coefficients:
    `5x² - 15x - 4 = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>

2.  **Make the leading coefficient 1:** Divide the entire equation by 5 to ensure the `x²` term has a coefficient of 1. This is a common strategy when using completing the square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
    `x² - 3x - 4/5 = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>
    This form makes [[factoring_quadratic_equations|factoring]] very challenging due to the fraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

3.  **Isolate the x-terms:** Move the constant term to the right side of the equation by adding `4/5` to both sides:
    `x² - 3x = 4/5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>

4.  **Complete the square:**
    *   Take half of the `x` coefficient (-3): `-3/2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
    *   Square this value: `(-3/2)² = 9/4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
    *   Add `9/4` to both sides of the equation:
        `x² - 3x + 9/4 = 4/5 + 9/4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>

5.  **Simplify the right side:** Find a common denominator (20) for the fractions on the right side:
    `4/5 = 16/20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>
    `9/4 = 45/20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>
    `16/20 + 45/20 = 61/20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>
    So, the equation becomes: `x² - 3x + 9/4 = 61/20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>

6.  **Rewrite the left side as a perfect square:**
    `(x - 3/2)² = 61/20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>

7.  **Solve for x:**
    *   Take the square root of both sides:
        `x - 3/2 = ±√(61/20)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>
    *   Add `3/2` to both sides:
        `x = 3/2 ± √(61/20)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>

The exact solutions are `x = 3/2 + √(61/20)` and `x = 3/2 - √(61/20)`.
Using a calculator, these approximate to:
*   `x ≈ 3.246` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>
*   `x ≈ -0.246` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>

Completing the square is a powerful method for [[solving_difficult_quadratic_equations|solving difficult quadratic equations]] and is particularly useful when [[factoring_quadratic_equations|factoring]] is not straightforward or possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. This technique will be used to derive the [[quadratic_formula_introduction|quadratic formula]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

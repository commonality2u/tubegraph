Absolute value is a concept in algebra that can sometimes be confusing, but it becomes clearer by understanding its fundamental meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The absolute value of a number represents its distance from zero on a number line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. For example, the absolute value of -6 is 6, as it is 6 units away from 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Similarly, the absolute value of -11 is 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## [[solving_absolute_value_inequalities | Solving Absolute Value Inequalities]]

When working with inequalities involving absolute values, visualizing a number line can prevent confusion and is often more effective than memorizing rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### Case 1: Absolute Value Less Than a Number

When an absolute value is *less than* a number, it means that the expression inside the absolute value sign must be closer to zero than that number.

**Example 1: The absolute value of x is less than 12**
`|x| < 12` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>

This inequality asks for all x values that are less than 12 units away from 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
On a number line, this range spans from -12 to +12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Any number between these two points will have an absolute value less than 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

*   This can be expressed as: `x > -12` AND `x < 12` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   In interval notation, the solution is `(-12, 12)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   A concise way to write this is: `-12 < x < 12` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

**Example 2: The absolute value of 5x + 3 is less than 7**
`|5x + 3| < 7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>

This means that `5x + 3` must be less than 7 units away from 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Therefore, `5x + 3` must be between -7 and 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

*   Set up the compound inequality: `-7 < 5x + 3 < 7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
*   Subtract 3 from all parts: `-7 - 3 < 5x + 3 - 3 < 7 - 3` which simplifies to `-10 < 5x < 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   Divide all parts by 5: `-10/5 < 5x/5 < 4/5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
*   Solution: `-2 < x < 4/5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   In interval notation, the solution is `(-2, 4/5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

### Case 2: Absolute Value Greater Than or Equal to a Number

When an absolute value is *greater than or equal to* a number, it means the expression inside the absolute value sign must be further from zero than that number.

**Example 3: The absolute value of 7x is greater than or equal to 21**
`|7x| >= 21` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>

This means that `7x` must be 21 or more units away from 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
On a number line, this includes numbers at or beyond +21, and numbers at or beyond -21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

*   This leads to two separate inequalities:
    *   `7x >= 21` (if `7x` is positive or zero) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>
    *   OR `7x <= -21` (if `7x` is negative, so its distance from zero is greater than 21) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>
*   Solve the first inequality: Divide both sides by 7, `x >= 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
*   Solve the second inequality: Divide both sides by 7, `x <= -3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   The solution set is `x >= 3` OR `x <= -3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

**Example 4: The absolute value of 2x/7 + 9 is greater than 5/7**
`|2x/7 + 9| > 5/7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>

This means `2x/7 + 9` must be more than 5/7 units away from 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

*   Set up two separate inequalities:
    *   `2x/7 + 9 > 5/7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>
    *   OR `2x/7 + 9 < -5/7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>
*   To simplify, multiply all terms by 7 in both inequalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>:
    *   `2x + 63 > 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>
    *   `2x + 63 < -5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>
*   Solve the first inequality:
    *   Subtract 63: `2x > 5 - 63` -> `2x > -58` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>
    *   Divide by 2: `x > -29` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>
*   Solve the second inequality:
    *   Subtract 63: `2x < -5 - 63` -> `2x < -68` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>
    *   Divide by 2: `x < -34` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>
*   The solution set is `x > -29` OR `x < -34` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.

## General Rules for Absolute Value Inequalities

While understanding the visualization on a number line is key, these general rules can be observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>:

*   **If `|f(x)| < a` (where `a` is a positive number):**
    This translates to `-a < f(x) < a` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   **If `|f(x)| > a` (where `a` is a positive number):**
    This translates to `f(x) > a` OR `f(x) < -a` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

> [!INFO] Key takeaway
> Always remember that absolute value represents distance from zero. Use a number line to visualize the conditions of the inequality, and this will guide you in setting up the correct compound or disjoined inequalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

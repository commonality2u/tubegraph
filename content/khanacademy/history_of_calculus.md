[[Calculus]] is a branch of mathematics primarily concerned with instantaneous rates of change and the accumulation of quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Founding Fathers

The foundational concepts of calculus were largely established in the late 1600s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a> by two prominent figures:
*   **[[Isaac Newton]]** (British mathematician and physicist) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>
*   **Gottfried Leibnitz** (German philosopher and mathematician), a contemporary of Newton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>

Together, these two gentlemen are considered the "founding fathers of calculus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## The Fundamental Question

Both Newton and Leibnitz were driven by a shared fundamental question: "What is the instantaneous rate of change of something?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This question is precisely what [[Differential Calculus and Its Applications | differential calculus]] aims to answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

For instance, in the context of a sprinter like [[Usain Bolt and Calculus | Usain Bolt]], the question is: "How fast is he going *right now*?" This differs from average speed calculated over a period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

Newton's original term for [[Differential Calculus and Its Applications | differential calculus]] was "the method of fluxions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Instantaneous Rate of Change vs. Average Rate of Change

To understand the core concept of [[Differential Calculus and Its Applications | differential calculus]], it's helpful to distinguish between average and instantaneous rates of change.

### Average Rate of Change
Traditional [[origins_of_algebra | algebra]] can calculate an average speed or rate of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   **Calculation:** Average speed is determined by the total change in distance divided by the total change in time (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Delta y%2F\Delta x" title="\Delta y%2F\Delta x" />) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Graphical Representation:** On a distance-time graph, this represents the slope of a line connecting two distinct points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   **Example (Usain Bolt):** [[Usain Bolt and Calculus | Usain Bolt]] ran 100 meters in 9.58 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. His average speed was approximately 10.4 meters per second, or about 23.5 miles per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

### Instantaneous Rate of Change
The instantaneous rate of change is different from the average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. An object's speed or rate of change is rarely constant; it accelerates and decelerates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

*   **Challenge with Algebra:** It is not straightforward to address instantaneous change with traditional [[origins_of_algebra | algebra]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. If one simply sets the change in time to zero, the calculation becomes undefined (division by zero) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
*   **Graphical Representation:** On a distance-time curve, the instantaneous speed at any given moment corresponds to the slope of the tangent line at that specific point on the curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
    *   [[Usain Bolt and Calculus | Usain Bolt's]] peak instantaneous velocity was closer to 30 miles per hour, significantly higher than his average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

## Introduction to Derivatives

[[Introduction to derivatives in calculus | Derivatives]] are the core concept in [[Differential Calculus and Its Applications | differential calculus]] used to find instantaneous rates of change.

The process involves taking the limit of the average rate of change as the change in the independent variable (e.g., time) approaches zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>:
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>
<br>
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}" title="\lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}" />
<br>

This limit allows for the calculation of the instantaneous slope or rate of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

*   **Terminology:** This instantaneous slope is called the [[Introduction to derivatives in calculus | derivative]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   **Notation:** The notation for the [[Introduction to derivatives in calculus | derivative]] is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?dy%2Fdx" title="dy%2Fdx" /> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. The terms "dy" and "dx" are referred to as differentials, representing infinitely small changes in y and x, respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. This approach enables the determination of instantaneous speed or other rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

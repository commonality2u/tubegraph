The number of COVID-19 cases reported daily often significantly understates the actual number of infections in an area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This discrepancy arises because [[impact_of_testing_on_reported_covid19_case_numbers | reported cases]] are based only on individuals who have been tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Many infected individuals may not have symptoms, or their symptoms might not be severe enough to warrant testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, leading to a much larger number of [[estimating_actual_covid19_cases_from_deaths | actual cases]] than confirmed ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

The analysis presented is largely based on work by Thomas Pueyo, who published an insightful blog post on Medium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Case Study: Hubei Province, China

A diagram illustrating the situation in Hubei Province (where Wuhan is located) highlights the difference between confirmed and actual cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

*   **Yellow Bars**: Represent the number of [[impact_of_testing_on_reported_covid19_case_numbers | confirmed new cases]] reported daily, based on positive tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   **Gray Bars**: Show the [[estimating_actual_covid19_cases_from_deaths | actual number of new cases]] per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

On January 23rd, for example, the reported [[impact_of_testing_on_reported_covid19_case_numbers | confirmed new cases]] were around 300, while the [[estimating_actual_covid19_cases_from_deaths | actual new cases]] were close to 2,500 â€“ roughly eight times higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

### How Actual Cases Were Estimated

Chinese officials were able to determine the actual number of cases in hindsight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. When an individual tested positive, they were asked about the date of their first symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. If symptoms began 10 days prior, that individual's case was retroactively counted as an actual new case on that earlier date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

### Impact of Shutdown

Wuhan was shut down on January 23rd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   Before the shutdown, as city officials observed increasing [[impact_of_testing_on_reported_covid19_case_numbers | confirmed cases]], [[estimating_actual_covid19_cases_from_deaths | actual cases]] were already significantly higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   The shutdown significantly slowed the spread rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   A few days later, the [[estimating_actual_covid19_cases_from_deaths | actual cases]] began to flatten and then decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   However, [[impact_of_testing_on_reported_covid19_case_numbers | confirmed new cases]] continued to rise for a period due to a delay between symptom onset and testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### Cumulative Totals (as of January 22nd)

As of January 22nd, before the shutdown:
*   Total [[estimating_actual_covid19_cases_from_deaths | actual cases]]: Approximately 12,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   Total [[impact_of_testing_on_reported_covid19_case_numbers | confirmed cases]]: Roughly 444 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

This demonstrates that even with "reasonably good testing" by Chinese standards at the time, the [[understanding_ratios_in_different_scenarios | ratio]] of [[estimating_actual_covid19_cases_from_deaths | actual cases]] to [[impact_of_testing_on_reported_covid19_case_numbers | confirmed cases]] was significantly skewed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. In other geographies, this [[understanding_ratios_in_different_scenarios | ratio]] is likely higher due to less extensive testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>, as seen in countries like the United States as of early March <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

## [[estimating_actual_covid19_cases_from_deaths | Estimating Actual Cases]] from Deaths

One way to [[estimating_actual_covid19_cases_from_deaths | estimate the actual number of cases]] is by using the number of deaths and several key estimations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>:

1.  **[[factors_influencing_covid19_mortality_rates | Mortality Rate]]**: Assumed at 1% for calculation purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Reported rates vary from 0.6% (South Korea) to about 5% (Iran), with higher rates often linked to an [[factors_influencing_covid19_mortality_rates | overwhelmed hospital system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
2.  **[[time_from_infection_to_death_estimation_in_covid19_cases | Time from Infection to Death]]**: Estimated at 20 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
    *   Incubation period (infection to symptoms): Approximately 5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
    *   Symptoms to death: Approximately 15 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
3.  **Days to Doubling**: This refers to how long it takes for infections to double in the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. It is highly dependent on population density and interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. A conservative estimate of 5 days is used for calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

### Example Calculation

Let's assume one death is reported in a region today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
*   **20 days ago**: Given the 20-day [[time_from_infection_to_death_estimation_in_covid19_cases | time from infection to death]] estimate, that person likely contracted the virus 20 days prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
*   **Initial Infections**: With a 1% [[factors_influencing_covid19_mortality_rates | mortality rate]], one death implies that approximately 100 people were infected on that day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
    *   *Note*: If the [[factors_influencing_covid19_mortality_rates | mortality rate]] was 0.5%, it would imply 200 initial infections; if 5%, it would imply 20 initial infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
*   **Infection Doubling**: Assuming a 5-day doubling rate for infections:
    *   15 days ago (5 days after initial infection): 100 infections double to **200 cases** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
    *   10 days ago (10 days after initial infection): 200 cases double to **400 cases** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
    *   5 days ago (15 days after initial infection): 400 cases double to **800 cases** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.
    *   Today (20 days after initial infection): 800 cases double to approximately **1,600 cases** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.

Therefore, one death reported today suggests approximately 1,600 [[estimating_actual_covid19_cases_from_deaths | actual cases]] currently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

## Real-World Implications

This estimation method provides a sobering perspective on how seriously the situation should be taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. The [[impact_of_testing_on_reported_covid19_case_numbers | reported data]] consistently lags behind the true circumstances, especially in areas with limited testing, like the United States in the early stages of the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

For instance, in Santa Clara County, California, with a total of two reported deaths, the [[impact_of_testing_on_reported_covid19_case_numbers | reported cases]] were under a hundred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. However, based on this analysis, the [[estimating_actual_covid19_cases_from_deaths | actual number of infected persons]] was likely at least ten times higher, possibly ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Take the situation seriously.
> The [[factors_influencing_covid19_mortality_rates | mortality rate]] of COVID-19 can increase if the [[factors_influencing_covid19_mortality_rates | hospital system]] becomes overwhelmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. Social isolation and proper precautions can lower the spread rate, preventing hospitals from being overwhelmed and keeping the [[factors_influencing_covid19_mortality_rates | mortality rate]] as low as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. Complacency due to lagging [[impact_of_testing_on_reported_covid19_case_numbers | reported data]] (especially due to a [[impact_of_testing_on_reported_covid19_case_numbers | lack of testing]]) risks overwhelming the [[factors_influencing_covid19_mortality_rates | hospital system]] and causing the [[factors_influencing_covid19_mortality_rates | mortality rate to go higher]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

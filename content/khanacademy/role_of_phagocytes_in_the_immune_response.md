Phagocytes are a crucial component of the [[innate_immune_system_and_its_components | innate immune system]], acting as a second line of defense against pathogens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. They are a type of [[functions_of_lymphocytes_b_and_t_cells | white blood cell]], also known as leukocytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Nonspecific Defense Mechanism

Phagocytes are considered **nonspecific** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This means they do not differentiate between specific types of viruses, proteins, or bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Their primary function is to recognize foreign or "shady" entities and "eat them up" or "kill them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. For example, if they detect double-stranded DNA floating around, which is characteristic of viruses, they will engulf it without knowing the specific virus type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

### Examples of Phagocytes
Key examples of phagocytes include:
*   [[role_of_mast_cells_and_dendritic_cells | Dendritic cells]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>
*   Macrophages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>
*   Neutrophils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>

All these cells are types of [[functions_of_lymphocytes_b_and_t_cells | white blood cells]] or leukocytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Connection to the Adaptive Immune System
While primarily part of the nonspecific immune response, phagocytes also play a role in the [[difference_between_innate_and_adaptive_immune_systems | specific or adaptive immune system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. They act as "antigen presenting molecules," which is a process that feeds into the specific immune response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

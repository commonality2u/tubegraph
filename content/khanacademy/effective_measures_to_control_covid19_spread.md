Estimating the actual number of new COVID-19 cases in a given area is crucial for understanding the true spread of the virus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article is based on an [[Analysis of COVID19 spread rates and mortality | analysis]] by Thomas Pueyo, who published a blog post on Medium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## The Challenge of Lagging Data
The number of COVID-19 cases reported daily is often based on confirmed cases from individuals who have been tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. However, many people may not have symptoms or their symptoms are not severe enough to warrant testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>, meaning the [[difference_between_reported_and_actual_covid19_cases | actual cases]] are likely much larger than the reported numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. This [[impact_of_testing_limitations_on_reported_covid19_cases | impact of testing limitations]] makes the reported data lag significantly behind the real situation on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>, especially in regions with limited testing capabilities, such as the United States as of March 3rd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.

## Hubei Province Case Study: The Impact of Shutdown
A graphical representation of the situation in Hubei Province (where Wuhan is located) illustrates this difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. For example, on January 23rd, 2020, there were approximately 300 confirmed new cases, but the actual number of new cases was estimated to be close to 2,500 â€“ roughly eight times higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. This "actual" number was determined in hindsight by Chinese officials who asked tested individuals when they first experienced symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

Wuhan was shut down on January 23rd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. Before the shutdown, the actual cases were significantly higher than confirmed cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. After the city's closure, the spread rate was significantly slowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. A few days later, the actual cases, calculated in hindsight, began to flatten and then decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. However, confirmed new cases continued to rise due to the delay between symptom onset and testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

Without this serious shutdown, the exponential growth of cases would have continued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. As of January 22nd, before the city went into shutdown, the total actual number of cases was approximately 12,000, compared to only about 444 confirmed cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.

## The Importance of Precautionary Measures
The significant takeaway is to take the situation very seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>. The mortality rate can fluctuate based on the healthcare system's capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:00]</a>.

> "If we all socially isolate and take the proper precaution, the spread rate will lower and we won't overwhelm the hospital system and will hopefully be able to keep the mortality rate as low as possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>.

Conversely, complacency, driven by lagging reported data due to insufficient testing, risks overwhelming the hospital system in a matter of weeks, which could lead to a higher mortality rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>.

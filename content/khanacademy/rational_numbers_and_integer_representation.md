Rational numbers are defined as any number that can be represented as the ratio of two integers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Integer Representation
Any integer is a rational number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. For example, the number 1 can be represented in multiple ways as the ratio of two integers, such as:
*   1/1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>
*   -2/-2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>
*   10,000/10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>

There are an infinite number of such representations for any given integer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Similarly, the integer -7 can be represented as:
*   -7/1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>
*   7/-1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>
*   -14/2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>

## Non-Integer Rational Numbers
Numbers that are not integers can also be rational numbers, provided they can be expressed as a ratio of two integers. This is referred to as [[fractional_representation_of_noninteger_rational_numbers]].

### Decimals
Consider the decimal 3.75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. It can be represented as:
*   375/100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>
*   750/200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>
*   15/4 (derived from 3 and 3/4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>
*   -30/-8 (multiplying numerator and denominator by -2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>

### [[Repeating decimals as rational numbers]]
[[Repeating decimals as rational numbers]] are another category of numbers that can be represented as a ratio of two integers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   0.333... (or 0.3 repeating) is equal to 1/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   0.6 repeating is equal to 2/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

Any repeating decimal, regardless of the number of repeating digits, can always be represented as the ratio of two integers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. This concept is part of [[recurring_decimals_representation]].

## Distinction from [[Irrational numbers and their characteristics]]
While rational numbers include all integers, all finite non-repeating decimals, and all repeating decimals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, there are numbers that cannot be expressed as the ratio of two integers. These are called [[irrational_numbers_and_their_characteristics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Some of the most well-known [[irrational_numbers_and_their_characteristics]] include:
*   Pi (π): The ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. It never terminates or repeats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   e (Euler's number): Also never terminates or repeats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   The square root of 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   Phi (Φ): The golden ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

The square root of any non-perfect square will result in an [[irrational_numbers_and_their_characteristics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. The [[relationship_between_rational_and_irrational_numbers]] also shows that the sum of an irrational and a rational number is irrational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>, and the product of an irrational and a rational number is also irrational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

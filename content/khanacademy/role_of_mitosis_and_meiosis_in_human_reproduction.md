The processes of [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]] and [[overview_of_meiosis | meiosis]] are fundamental to life, playing distinct yet complementary roles in the growth, development, and reproduction of human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]] is responsible for the proliferation of most body cells, [[overview_of_meiosis | meiosis]] is essential for sexual reproduction through the creation of specialized sex cells.

## Mitosis: Growth and Somatic Cell Division

[[overview_of_mitosis | Mitosis]] begins with a diploid cell, meaning it contains a full set of chromosomes (2n) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. For humans, this diploid number is 46 chromosomes, consisting of 23 [[role_of_homologous_pairs_in_meiosis | homologous pairs]] (23 from the mother and 23 from the father) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

After undergoing [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]], the original cell divides to produce two genetically identical daughter cells, each retaining the diploid (2n) number of chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. These new cells are capable of entering interphase, growing, replicating their DNA, and undergoing [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]] again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

This cycle of [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]] is how most cells in the human body grow and divide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. It is the primary process by which a single-celled organism (like a fertilized egg) develops into a complex multicellular human being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Cells that undergo [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]] are predominantly [[cell_division_in_somatic_and_germ_cells | somatic cells]], which make up the bulk of the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

## Meiosis: Gamete Formation for Reproduction

In contrast, [[overview_of_meiosis | meiosis]] is a specialized cell division process that occurs in two phases, Meiosis I and Meiosis II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. It also begins with a diploid cell (2n), which replicates its DNA during interphase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

### Meiosis I

During Meiosis I, the original diploid cell divides into two cells, each of which now has a haploid (n) number of chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. For humans, this means a cell with 46 chromosomes divides into two cells, each with 23 chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. This reduction in chromosome number occurs because Meiosis I involves the splitting of [[role_of_homologous_pairs_in_meiosis | homologous pairs]], leading to genetic variation as chromosomes are randomly distributed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

### Meiosis II

Following Meiosis I, each of the two haploid cells undergoes Meiosis II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Meiosis II is very similar to [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]], but it starts with haploid cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. The result of Meiosis II is four cells, each containing a haploid (n) number of chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. These four resulting cells are not necessarily genetically identical due to the processes in Meiosis I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

### Gamete Formation ([[Gametogenesis | Gametogenesis]])

The haploid cells produced by [[overview_of_meiosis | meiosis]] are known as [[Gametogenesis | gametes]], or sex cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. Unlike cells produced by [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]], [[Gametogenesis | gametes]] are not part of a continuous cycle; they are specialized for fertilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

*   In males, [[overview_of_meiosis | meiosis]] occurs in the testes to produce sperm cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   In females, [[overview_of_meiosis | meiosis]] occurs in the ovaries to produce egg cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

These [[Gametogenesis | gametes]] are critical for sexual reproduction. When a sperm cell fuses with an egg cell during fertilization, their haploid nuclei combine to form a new diploid cell (a zygote) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. This fertilized egg then undergoes repeated [[overview_of_mitosis | mitotic]] divisions to develop into an entirely new organism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

## Cell Division in Somatic and Germ Cells

The distinction between [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]] and [[overview_of_meiosis | meiosis]] is also evident in the types of cells where they occur:

*   **[[cell_division_in_somatic_and_germ_cells | Somatic cells]]**: These cells, which form the body's tissues and organs, primarily undergo [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]] for growth and repair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   **[[cell_division_in_somatic_and_germ_cells | Germ cells]]**: Located in the reproductive organs (testes and ovaries), [[cell_division_in_somatic_and_germ_cells | germ cells]] are unique because they can undergo both [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]] and [[overview_of_meiosis | meiosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
    *   They can divide by [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]] to produce more diploid [[cell_division_in_somatic_and_germ_cells | germ cells]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
    *   They can also undergo [[overview_of_meiosis | meiosis]] to produce haploid [[Gametogenesis | gametes]] (sperm or egg cells) for reproduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

In summary, [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]] ensures the growth and repair of the organism, while [[overview_of_meiosis | meiosis]] facilitates sexual reproduction by producing genetically diverse [[Gametogenesis | gametes]], thus contributing to the continuation of the species.

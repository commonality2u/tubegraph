Fermentation is a side process that occurs when cells run out of oxygen, preventing the continuation of the Krebs cycle and the electron transport chain, which require oxygen to function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. When oxygen is scarce, byproducts from [[glycolysis_process_and_its_role_in_breaking_down_glucose | glycolysis]] are diverted into fermentation instead of moving to the Krebs cycle and electron transport chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. This process occurs in the absence of oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

## Byproducts of Fermentation

The specific byproducts of fermentation vary depending on the organism:
*   **Alcohol Fermentation** For some organisms, such as yeast, fermentation processes the byproducts of [[glycolysis_process_and_its_role_in_breaking_down_glucose | glycolysis]] to produce alcohol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.
*   **Lactic Acid Fermentation** Human muscles, along with those of other mammals, do not directly produce alcohol. Instead, they produce lactic acid through lactic acid fermentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. This buildup of lactic acid can cause muscle ache during intense physical activity, such as sprinting, when the body cannot supply enough oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

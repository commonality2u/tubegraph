SOH CAH TOA is a mnemonic device used in trigonometry to remember the definitions of the three basic trigonometric ratios: sine, cosine, and tangent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. This mnemonic helps recall the relationship between the sides of a right triangle and its angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.

## Understanding the Mnemonic

The SOH CAH TOA mnemonic breaks down as follows:
*   **SOH**: **S**ine = **O**pposite / **H**ypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>
*   **CAH**: **C**osine = **A**djacent / **H**ypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>
*   **TOA**: **T**angent = **O**pposite / **A**djacent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>

This mnemonic is often written down or repeated when solving trigonometric problems to aid in recall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

## Application in Right Triangles

Trigonometry primarily involves the study of right triangles and the relationships between their sides and angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. When applying SOH CAH TOA, it's crucial to identify the sides of the triangle relative to a specific angle (often denoted by theta, θ) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.

Consider a right triangle with sides 3, 4, and a hypotenuse of 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. Let θ be one of the non-right angles.

### Identifying Sides Relative to an Angle

*   **Hypotenuse**: The longest side of the right triangle, always opposite the right angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.
*   **Opposite Side**: The side directly across from the angle being considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.
*   **Adjacent Side**: The side next to the angle being considered that is not the hypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.

### Calculating Trigonometric Ratios

Using the SOH CAH TOA mnemonic, we can determine the trigonometric ratios for a given angle:

*   **Sine (sin)**:
    *   For angle θ, if the opposite side is 4 and the hypotenuse is 5, then sine(θ) = Opposite / Hypotenuse = 4/5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.
*   **Cosine (cos)**:
    *   For angle θ, if the adjacent side is 3 and the hypotenuse is 5, then cosine(θ) = Adjacent / Hypotenuse = 3/5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.
*   **Tangent (tan)**:
    *   For angle θ, if the opposite side is 4 and the adjacent side is 3, then tangent(θ) = Opposite / Adjacent = 4/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.

It is important to note that the values of the trigonometric functions depend on the specific angle chosen within the triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>. For example, if a different angle (e.g., angle *x*) in the same triangle is chosen, the opposite and adjacent sides relative to *x* would change, thus changing the tangent ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>. For angle *x*, the opposite side is 3 and the adjacent side is 4, making tangent(*x*) = 3/4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>.

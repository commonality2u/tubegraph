[[cellular_respiration_process | Cellular respiration]] is broadly broken down into three main phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## 1. Glycolysis

[[glycolysis_process_and_phases | Glycolysis]], meaning "the breaking down of glucose," is the first phase of [[cellular_respiration_process | cellular respiration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. It begins with a glucose molecule, which has a formula of C6H12O6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Glucose can be visualized as a six-carbon chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

[[overview_of_glycolysis | Glycolysis]] can proceed with or without oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

### Phases of Glycolysis

[[glycolysis_process_and_phases | Glycolysis]] involves two important phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>:

1.  **Investment Phase:** This phase requires the use of two ATP molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. The glucose molecule is broken down into two 3-carbon compounds, which also acquire phosphate groups from the ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. These compounds are sometimes referred to as PGAL or phosphoglyceraldehyde <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
2.  **Payoff Phase:** Each of the two PGAL molecules proceeds into this phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. During the payoff phase, each PGAL molecule is converted into pyruvate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. This process yields two ATPs and one NADH per PGAL molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

### Inputs and Outputs of Glycolysis

The overall reaction for [[steps_and_reactions_in_glycolysis | glycolysis]] starts with one glucose molecule, two NAD+ molecules, and four ADP molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

The outputs of [[steps_and_reactions_in_glycolysis | glycolysis]] from one glucose molecule are:
*   **Two Pyruvates:** Pyruvate (or pyruvic acid) is a 3-carbon molecule and the end product of [[glycolysis_process_and_phases | glycolysis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. The original six-carbon glucose molecule is split in half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. These pyruvates will serve as raw materials for the [[enzymecatalyzed_reactions_in_the_krebs_cycle | Krebs cycle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
*   **Two Net ATPs:** Four ATPs are produced in the payoff phase, but two ATPs are consumed in the investment phase, resulting in a net gain of two ATPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **Two NADHs:** NAD+ is reduced to NADH by gaining a hydrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. These NADHs will later be used in the [[structure_and_function_of_mitochondria_in_cellular_respiration | electron transport chain]] to produce more ATPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

The carbon in glucose gets oxidized during this process as hydrogens are stripped off, and carbons bond more strongly with oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.

## 2. Post-Glycolysis Pathways

### Fermentation

If oxygen is not present, the cell proceeds to fermentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. In humans, fermentation produces lactic acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. In other organisms, it might produce alcohol or ethanol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. These are examples of [[anaerobic_vs_aerobic_processes_in_cells | anaerobic processes]].

### Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle)

If oxygen is available, the process continues to the [[enzymecatalyzed_reactions_in_the_krebs_cycle | Krebs cycle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The [[enzymecatalyzed_reactions_in_the_krebs_cycle | Krebs cycle]] is also known as the citric acid cycle because it involves citric acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The pyruvate produced during [[glycolysis_process_and_phases | glycolysis]] is re-engineered into acetyl-CoA, which serves as the raw material for the [[enzymecatalyzed_reactions_in_the_krebs_cycle | Krebs cycle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

### Electron Transport Chain (ETC)

Following the [[enzymecatalyzed_reactions_in_the_krebs_cycle | Krebs cycle]], the process moves to the [[structure_and_function_of_mitochondria_in_cellular_respiration | electron transport chain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The [[structure_and_function_of_mitochondria_in_cellular_respiration | electron transport chain]] is where the majority of ATP is produced, utilizing raw materials like NADH from the earlier phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Each NADH can produce approximately three ATPs in the [[structure_and_function_of_mitochondria_in_cellular_respiration | electron transport chain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

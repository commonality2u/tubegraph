Equations represent a balance, where the expression on one side of the equality sign is equivalent to the expression on the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. To maintain this balance when solving for an unknown variable, any [[operations_on_both_sides_of_an_equation | operation performed on one side]] must also be performed on the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This principle is fundamental to [[visualizing_and_understanding_equations | understanding and manipulating equations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Visualizing Equations: An Example

Consider the equation `3x + 5 = 17` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.
*   `3x` literally means `x` plus `x` plus `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   `+ 5` means adding five individual objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   The entire left side (`3x + 5`) is equal to 17 objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

### Step 1: Isolating the Variable Term (Subtraction)

To simplify `3x + 5 = 17` and get `3x` by itself on the left side, the goal is to eliminate the `+5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   **Action**: Subtract 5 from the left-hand side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This cancels out the `+5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **Balance**: To maintain the equality, subtract 5 from the right-hand side as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
    *   `17 - 5 = 12` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   **Resulting Equation**: The equation simplifies to `3x = 12` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

### Step 2: Solving for the Variable (Division)

With `3x = 12`, the next step is to find the value of `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
*   **Action**: Divide the left-hand side by 3 to isolate `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. This cancels out the coefficient of `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   **Balance**: Divide the right-hand side by 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
    *   `12 / 3 = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **Solution**: `x = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

## Solving Equations with Negative Numbers

The same principles apply when equations involve negative numbers. Consider `7x - 2 = -10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

### Step 1: Isolating the Variable Term (Addition)

To get `7x` by itself, eliminate the `-2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   **Action**: Add 2 to the left-hand side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. (`-2 + 2 = 0`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   **Balance**: Add 2 to the right-hand side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
    *   To calculate `-10 + 2`, visualize a number line: starting at -10 and moving 2 steps to the right (positive direction) lands at -8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   **Resulting Equation**: `7x = -8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

### Step 2: Solving for the Variable (Division)

Now, solve for `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
*   **Action**: Divide the left-hand side by 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.
*   **Balance**: Divide the right-hand side by 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
*   **Solution**: `x = -8/7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. This can also be expressed as a mixed number: `x = -1 1/7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

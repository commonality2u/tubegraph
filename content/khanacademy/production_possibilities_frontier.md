The Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF) is an economic concept that illustrates the maximum possible output combinations of two goods or services that an economy or individual can achieve when all resources are fully and [[understanding_optimal_production | optimally]] used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. It shows the [[tradeoffs_in_resource_allocation | tradeoffs]] involved in allocating resources between different productive activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Hunter-Gatherer Example

Consider a hunter-gatherer who allocates time between hunting rabbits and gathering berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Assuming that rabbits are the only animal to hunt and berries are the only item to gather, various scenarios demonstrate the [[tradeoffs_in_resource_allocation | tradeoffs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

### Scenarios of Production

To understand the PPF, different production scenarios are considered, each representing a specific allocation of the hunter-gatherer's time. In each scenario, it is assumed that all other factors (like total available time, sleep, hunting/gathering techniques, and geography) remain constant, a concept known as [[ceteris_paribus_in_economics | ceteris paribus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>:

*   **Scenario A:** Spending all available time hunting allows for 5 rabbits and 0 berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   **Scenario B:** Allocating time for 4 rabbits on average results in 100 berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **Scenario C:** Focusing on 3 rabbits enables the gathering of 180 berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   **Scenario D:** Reducing hunting to 2 rabbits allows for 240 berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Scenario E:** Hunting only 1 rabbit yields 280 berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   **Scenario F:** Devoting all time to gathering results in 300 berries and 0 rabbits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## Graphing the Production Possibilities Frontier

These scenarios can be plotted on a graph with one good (e.g., rabbits) on the vertical axis and the other (e.g., berries) on the horizontal axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

```
       Rabbits (Y-axis)
         5 | A
         4 |   B
         3 |     C
         2 |       D
         1 |         E
         0 +----------------- Berries (X-axis)
           0   100 180 240 280 300
                                 F
```
The line connecting these points represents the Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. This curve illustrates all the possible combinations of rabbits and berries that can be produced given the hunter-gatherer's resources and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

## Interpreting the PPF

### Impossible Points

Any point *outside* or to the right of the PPF represents an impossible production combination. For example, getting 5 rabbits and 200 berries is impossible because if all time is spent on rabbits, no berries can be gathered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

### Possible but Inefficient Points

Any point *inside* or to the left of the PPF is possible but not [[efficient_versus_inefficient_resource_use | efficient]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. For instance, obtaining 1 rabbit and 200 berries is possible, but it is not [[understanding_optimal_production | optimal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. This indicates that resources are not being used to their full potential, and more of one or both goods could be produced without reducing the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

### Efficient Points

All points *on* the PPF are considered [[efficient_versus_inefficient_resource_use | efficient]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. At these points, the hunter-gatherer is doing the most they can with their available time and resources, making the most use of their time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. The PPF shows all the possibilities that can be achieved when resources are used optimally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

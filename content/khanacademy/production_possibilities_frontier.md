The production possibilities frontier (PPF) is an economic model that illustrates the various combinations of two goods or services that can be produced when resources are fully and [[efficiency_and_optimality_in_production | efficiently]] utilized, given a fixed amount of resources and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>. It demonstrates the concept of [[tradeoffs_and_resource_allocation | tradeoffs]] and [[scarce_resources_and_economic_decision_making | resource allocation]] in production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Hunter-Gatherer Example

To understand the PPF, consider a hunter-gatherer deciding how to allocate their time between hunting rabbits and gathering berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For simplicity, it's assumed that rabbits are the only animal to hunt and berries are the only item to gather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

### Ceteris Paribus

When analyzing different scenarios, a crucial assumption made is that "everything else is equal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This concept is formally known as *ceteris paribus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. It means that variables like sleep time, geography, tools, or technology are held constant, and only the allocation of time between hunting and gathering is changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

### Production Scenarios

Various scenarios illustrate the different possible combinations of rabbits and berries the hunter-gatherer can achieve in a day by reallocating time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>:

*   **Scenario A:** Spending all available time hunting results in 5 rabbits and 0 berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   **Scenario B:** Allocating some time to berries yields 4 rabbits and 100 berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Scenario C:** Further shifting time to berries results in 3 rabbits and 180 berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Scenario D:** With less time on rabbits, the outcome is 2 rabbits and 240 berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   **Scenario E:** Focusing more on berries leads to 1 rabbit and 280 berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
*   **Scenario F:** Spending all available time gathering results in 0 rabbits and 300 berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### Plotting the Frontier

These scenarios can be plotted on a graph with the number of rabbits on one axis and the number of berries on the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Connecting these points forms the **production possibilities frontier** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This curve represents all the possible combinations of rabbits and berries that can be produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

## Understanding Points on and Around the PPF

### Impossible Points

Any point *beyond* or *outside* the production possibilities frontier is impossible to achieve with the current resources and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. For example, simultaneously getting 5 rabbits and 200 berries is impossible, as getting 5 rabbits means spending all time on hunting, leaving no time for berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

### Possible but Inefficient Points

Points *inside* or *below* the production possibilities frontier are possible to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. For instance, getting 1 rabbit and 200 berries is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. However, such points are not [[efficiency_and_optimality_in_production | efficient]] or optimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. If the hunter-gatherer only obtained 1 rabbit and 200 berries, they would not be using their resources optimally, as they could get more berries for the same number of rabbits, or more rabbits for the same number of berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. This indicates that resources are not being utilized to their full potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

### Efficient Points

All points directly *on* the production possibilities frontier are considered **efficient** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. At these points, the hunter-gatherer is doing the most they can do with their available time and resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. There is no judgment here about which efficient point is "better" than another; it simply means that resources are being used to their maximum capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

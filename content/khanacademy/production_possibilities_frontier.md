The production possibilities frontier (PPF) is a curve that illustrates the variations in the amounts that can be produced of two products if both depend upon the same finite resources [00:06:38]. It demonstrates the [[tradeoffs_in_resource_allocation | tradeoffs]] involved in allocating time or resources between the production of different goods [00:00:12].

## Hunter-Gatherer Example

Consider a hunter-gatherer who must decide how to spend their time hunting rabbits or gathering berries [00:00:00]. For simplicity, it is assumed that only rabbits can be hunted [00:00:17] and only berries can be gathered [00:00:21].

### Scenarios and Outputs

The following scenarios illustrate different combinations of rabbits and berries that can be produced in a day, assuming all other factors remain equal (ceteris paribus) [00:01:30]:

> [!NOTE] Ceteris Paribus
> "Ceteris paribus" is a Latin phrase meaning "all other things being equal" [00:01:52]. When discussing different scenarios on the PPF, it implies that factors like sleep, geography, tools, technology, or hunting/gathering techniques are not changing [00:01:33], [00:02:30], [00:02:35]. The only variable adjusted is the allocation of time between hunting rabbits and gathering berries [00:02:40].

| Scenario | Number of Rabbits (Avg. per day) | Number of Berries (Avg. per day) |
| :------- | :------------------------------- | :------------------------------- |
| A        | 5                                | 0                                |
| B        | 4                                | 100                              |
| C        | 3                                | 180                              |
| D        | 2                                | 240                              |
| E        | 1                                | 280                              |
| F        | 0                                | 300                              |

*   **Scenario A:** If all available time is spent hunting, the hunter-gatherer can get 5 rabbits and 0 berries [00:00:54], [00:01:02].
*   **Scenario B:** Allocating slightly less time to hunting allows for 4 rabbits and 100 berries [00:01:19], [00:01:24].
*   **Scenario C:** With time for 3 rabbits, 180 berries can be gathered [00:02:54], [00:03:04].
*   **Scenario D:** Reducing hunting to 2 rabbits allows for 240 berries [00:03:13], [00:03:20].
*   **Scenario E:** Focusing on 1 rabbit yields 280 berries [00:03:30], [00:03:34].
*   **Scenario F:** If all time is spent gathering, 300 berries can be obtained, but no rabbits [00:03:52], [00:03:57].

### [[graphing_and_interpreting_production_possibilities | Graphing the Production Possibilities Frontier]]

These scenarios can be plotted on a graph with the number of rabbits on one axis and the number of berries on the other [00:04:02], [00:04:10].

The plotted points are:
*   Scenario A: (5 rabbits, 0 berries) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>
*   Scenario B: (4 rabbits, 100 berries) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>
*   Scenario C: (3 rabbits, 180 berries) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>
*   Scenario D: (2 rabbits, 240 berries) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>
*   Scenario E: (1 rabbit, 280 berries) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>
*   Scenario F: (0 rabbits, 300 berries) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>

When these points are connected, they form a curve known as the production possibilities frontier [00:07:02], [00:08:15]. This curve represents all possible combinations of rabbits and berries that can be produced given the available resources and technology [00:07:15].

## Interpreting Points on the Graph

### Efficient Production

Points *on* the production possibilities frontier (like Scenarios A-F) represent maximum output given current resources and technology [00:08:07]. These points are considered [[efficiency_in_production | efficient]] because the hunter-gatherer is making the most use of their time and resources [00:10:38], [00:10:55]. No more of one good can be produced without producing less of the other [00:06:52].

### Inefficient Production

Points *inside* or *below* the production possibilities frontier are possible to achieve but are not [[efficiency_in_production | efficient]] [00:09:33], [00:10:07]. For example, producing 1 rabbit and 200 berries is possible [00:09:43], but it is not optimal because, with the same resources, more berries could be gathered or more rabbits could be hunted [00:09:52], [00:09:57]. This indicates that resources are not being used optimally [00:10:17].

### Impossible Production

Points *outside* or *beyond* the production possibilities frontier are impossible to achieve with the current resources and technology [00:08:44], [00:09:00]. For instance, getting 5 rabbits and 200 berries is not possible because the time spent on rabbits would preclude gathering any berries, or vice-versa [00:09:05].

When solving equations, the primary goal is to [[operations_on_both_sides_of_an_equation | isolate the variable]] (e.g., 'x') to determine its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This process involves performing various [[algebraic_methods_in_algebra | algebraic steps]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. The core principle governing these steps is that any operation applied to one side of the equation must also be applied to the other side to maintain equality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Visualizing Algebraic Operations

Visualizing what occurs during algebraic operations can help in understanding their legitimacy and ensures that the rules are intuitively grasped, rather than just memorized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This approach makes the allowed operations common sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

Consider the equation: `2x + 3 = 5x - 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

Visually, this can be represented as:
*   **Left side:** Two 'x' terms and three '+1' terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   **Right side:** Five 'x' terms and two '-1' terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Step-by-Step Solution with Visualization

The objective is to gather all 'x' terms on one side and all constant terms on the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### 1. Isolating 'x' Terms

To get the 'x' terms on one side, one can choose to subtract `2x` from both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>:

*   **Algebraic Step:**
    `2x + 3 - 2x = 5x - 2 - 2x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>
*   **Simplification:**
    `3 = 3x - 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>

*   **Visual Representation:**
    Removing two 'x' terms from the left side requires removing two 'x' terms from the right side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. On the left, the 'x' terms cancel out, leaving only the '+3' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. On the right, `5x - 2x` results in `3x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

### 2. Isolating Constant Terms

Next, move the constant terms to the opposite side of the 'x' terms. To eliminate the `-2` from the right side, add `2` to both sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>:

*   **Algebraic Step:**
    `3 + 2 = 3x - 2 + 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>
*   **Simplification:**
    `5 = 3x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>

*   **Visual Representation:**
    Adding two '+1' terms to the left side and two '+1' terms to the right side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. On the right, the `-2` and `+2` cancel each other out, leaving only `3x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

### 3. Solving for 'x'

The final step is to isolate 'x' by dividing both sides by its coefficient, which is `3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>:

*   **Algebraic Step:**
    `5 / 3 = 3x / 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>
*   **Simplification:**
    `5/3 = x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>

The solution can be expressed as an improper fraction `5/3` or a mixed number `1 2/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. The order of `x = 5/3` or `5/3 = x` is [[understanding_equivalent_expressions_in_algebra | completely equivalent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

## Checking the Solution

After solving an equation, it is good practice to [[checking_solutions_in_algebra | substitute the obtained value of x back into the original equation]] to verify its correctness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. This step confirms that the solution works out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

As long as [[operations_on_both_sides_of_an_equation | legitimate operations are performed on both sides of the equation]], the correct answer will be obtained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

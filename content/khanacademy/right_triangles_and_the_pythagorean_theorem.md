[[right_triangles_and_trigonometry | Trigonometry]] is fundamentally the study of the ratios of sides of triangles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The term "trig" in [[right_triangles_and_trigonometry | trigonometry]] means "triangle," and "metry" means "measure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## What is a Right Triangle?

A [[right_triangles_and_trigonometry | right triangle]] is defined by having one angle that measures 90 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This 90-degree angle is also referred to as a right angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### The Hypotenuse

In a [[right_triangles_and_trigonometry | right triangle]], the hypotenuse is the side located directly opposite the right angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. It is always the longest side of a [[right_triangles_and_trigonometry | right triangle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

*   **Example:** For a [[right_triangles_and_trigonometry | right triangle]] with sides of length 3, 4, and 5:
    *   The side with length 3 can be the height <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
    *   The side with length 4 can be the base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
    *   The side with length 5 is the hypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## The [[pythagorean_theorem_in_right_triangles | Pythagorean Theorem]]

The [[pythagorean_theorem_in_right_triangles | Pythagorean theorem]] is a fundamental principle for [[right_triangles_and_trigonometry | right triangles]]. It states that the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides (legs) of a [[right_triangles_and_trigonometry | right triangle]] is equal to the square of the hypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

*   **Formula:** `a² + b² = c²`, where 'a' and 'b' are the lengths of the legs, and 'c' is the length of the hypotenuse.

*   **Example (3-4-5 triangle):**
    *   Using the example triangle with sides 3, 4, and 5:
    *   3² + 4² = 5² <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>
    *   9 + 16 = 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>
    *   25 = 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>
    *   This confirms that the sides satisfy the [[pythagorean_theorem_in_right_triangles | Pythagorean theorem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Introduction to [[basics_of_trigonometry | Trigonometry]] in Right Triangles

The core [[trigonometric_ratios_and_angle_identification | functions]] of [[basics_of_trigonometry | trigonometry]]—sine, cosine, and tangent—are defined by the ratios of the sides of a [[right_triangles_and_trigonometry | right triangle]] relative to a specific angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

A mnemonic "SOH CAH TOA" is often used to remember these definitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>:

*   **SOH:** **S**ine = **O**pposite / **H**ypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>
*   **CAH:** **C**osine = **A**djacent / **H**ypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>
*   **TOA:** **T**angent = **O**pposite / **A**djacent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>

The "opposite" and "adjacent" sides are relative to the angle being considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. The hypotenuse remains the same regardless of the angle chosen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

*   **Example using the 3-4-5 triangle:**
    *   For an angle (theta) between the side of length 4 and the hypotenuse of length 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>:
        *   The side of length 3 is **opposite** to theta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
        *   The side of length 4 is **adjacent** to theta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
        *   **Sine (theta)** = Opposite / Hypotenuse = 3 / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>
        *   **Cosine (theta)** = Adjacent / Hypotenuse = 4 / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>
        *   **Tangent (theta)** = Opposite / Adjacent = 3 / 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>

    *   For another angle (x) at the top of the triangle (between the side of length 3 and the hypotenuse of length 5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>:
        *   The side of length 4 is **opposite** to x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
        *   The side of length 3 is **adjacent** to x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
        *   **Sine (x)** = Opposite / Hypotenuse = 4 / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>
        *   **Cosine (x)** = Adjacent / Hypotenuse = 3 / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>
        *   **Tangent (x)** = Opposite / Adjacent = 4 / 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>

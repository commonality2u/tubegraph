[[Slope_of_a_straight_line | Slope]] indicates how steep a line is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. For any given straight line, its [[slope_of_a_straight_line | slope]] will always remain constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Definition of Slope

The best way to understand [[slope_of_a_straight_line | slope]] is to view it as the [[definition_of_slope_as_change_in_y_over_change_in_x | change in y over change in x]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This concept is sometimes represented using the Greek letter delta (Δ), a capital delta, which signifies "change in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. So, [[slope_of_a_straight_line | slope]] can be written as Δy / Δx <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Finding Slope Between Two Points on a Graph

To find the [[slope_of_a_straight_line | slope]] of a line from a graph, you can pick any two points on that line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. It's often easiest to choose points with clear integer coordinates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

### Example 1: Positive Changes

Using a starting point and moving right and up:
1.  **Identify Change in X (Δx):** If you start at an x-coordinate of -3 and move to an x-coordinate of 0, the change in x (Δx) is +3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. This can be visualized by counting 3 steps to the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
2.  **Identify Change in Y (Δy):** Correspondingly, if you start at a y-coordinate of -3 and move to a y-coordinate of -1, the change in y (Δy) is +2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This can be seen by counting 2 steps up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
3.  **Calculate Slope:** The [[slope_of_a_straight_line | slope]] is Δy / Δx, which in this case is 2 / 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

### Example 2: Negative Changes

You can pick any two points on the line, and even move in a different direction, and still get the same [[slope_of_a_straight_line | slope]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

Consider starting at a point and moving left and down:
1.  **Identify Change in Y (Δy):** If you move from a y-coordinate of 1 down to a y-coordinate of -3, the change in y (Δy) is -4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
2.  **Identify Change in X (Δx):** From an x-coordinate of 3 back to an x-coordinate of -3, the change in x (Δx) is -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. This represents moving 6 units to the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
3.  **Calculate Slope:** The [[slope_of_a_straight_line | slope]] is Δy / Δx, which is -4 / -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. The negatives cancel out, simplifying to 4/6, or 2/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

> [!INFO] Consistency is Key
> No matter which points you choose on the line, or the direction you move between them, you will always calculate the same [[slope_of_a_straight_line | slope]] value as long as you are consistent in your measurements of change in y and change in x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

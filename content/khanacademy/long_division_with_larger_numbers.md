To effectively divide into larger numbers, a foundational understanding of [[importance_of_multiplication_tables_for_division | multiplication tables]] is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. It is recommended to know your [[importance_of_multiplication_tables_for_division | multiplication tables]] from 1 times 1 up to at least 10 times 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, or even 12 times 12 as was traditionally taught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Basic Division using Multiplication Tables

Many division problems can be solved by simply knowing your [[importance_of_multiplication_tables_for_division | multiplication tables]]:

*   To divide 25 by 5, you consider "5 times what equals 25?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Since 5 times 5 equals 25, the answer is 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. When writing the answer, it's important to be careful with place notation, placing the 5 in the ones place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   Similarly, for 49 divided by 7, you ask "7 times what equals 49?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. The answer is 7, because 7 times 7 equals 49 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   To divide 54 by 9, you determine "9 times what equals 54?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Through knowledge of [[importance_of_multiplication_tables_for_division | multiplication tables]] (e.g., 9 x 5 = 45, 9 x 6 = 54), you find the answer is 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Division with [[handling_remainders_in_division | Remainders]]

Not all division problems result in a whole number. Sometimes, there will be a [[handling_remainders_in_division | remainder]].

*   To divide 23 by 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, you look for the largest multiple of 3 that is less than or equal to 23 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. The multiples of 3 are 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. The largest multiple of 3 that goes into 23 is 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   Since 3 times 7 is 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, 3 goes into 23 seven times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   Subtract the product (21) from the original number (23): 23 - 21 = 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This difference is the [[handling_remainders_in_division | remainder]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   So, 23 divided by 3 is 7 [[handling_remainders_in_division | remainder]] 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## [[using_long_division_with_multidigit_numbers | Long Division]] with Multidigit Numbers

For dividing larger numbers that are beyond simple multiplication table recall, a [[stepbystep_process_of_long_division | step-by-step process]] of [[using_long_division_with_multidigit_numbers | long division]] is used.

### Example: 344 divided by 4

1.  **Set up the problem:**
    ```
      ____
    4 | 344
    ```
    <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>

2.  **Divide the first digit(s):** Look at how many times 4 goes into the first digit (3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Since 4 does not go into 3 (or goes in 0 times), extend to the first two digits (34) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
    *   Using your 4-[[importance_of_multiplication_tables_for_division | multiplication tables]], 4 times 8 is 32, and 4 times 9 is 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
    *   Since 36 is larger than 34, 4 goes into 34 eight times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
    *   Write the '8' above the 4 in the tens place of 344 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

3.  **Multiply:** Multiply the quotient digit (8) by the divisor (4): 8 times 4 equals 32 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Write 32 below the 34 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

4.  **Subtract:** Subtract 32 from 34: 34 minus 32 equals 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

5.  **Bring down:** Bring down the next digit from the dividend (the 4 from 344) next to the remainder (2), forming 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

6.  **Repeat (divide, multiply, subtract, bring down):** Now, repeat the process with 24.
    *   How many times does 4 go into 24? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>
    *   4 times 6 is exactly 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
    *   Write the '6' above the 4 in the ones place of 344 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
    *   Multiply 6 by 4: 6 times 4 equals 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Write 24 below the 24.
    *   Subtract 24 from 24: 24 minus 24 equals 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

7.  **Final Result:** Since the [[handling_remainders_in_division | remainder]] is 0, 4 goes into 344 exactly 86 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

```

### Additional Examples

#### Example: 91 divided by 7

```
      13
    7 | 91
      -7
      --
       21
      -21
      ---
        0
```
7 goes into 9 once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. (1 x 7 = 7). 9 - 7 = 2. Bring down the 1 to make 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
7 goes into 21 three times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. (3 x 7 = 21). 21 - 21 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
So, 91 divided by 7 is 13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

#### Example: 608 divided by 8

```
      76
    8 | 608
      -56
      ---
       48
      -48
      ---
        0
```
8 goes into 60 seven times (8 x 7 = 56) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. 60 - 56 = 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. Bring down the 8 to make 48 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
8 goes into 48 six times (8 x 6 = 48) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. 48 - 48 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
So, 608 divided by 8 is 76 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

By practicing these steps and knowing your [[importance_of_multiplication_tables_for_division | multiplication tables]], you can tackle [[using_long_division_with_multidigit_numbers | long division]] problems with larger numbers effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

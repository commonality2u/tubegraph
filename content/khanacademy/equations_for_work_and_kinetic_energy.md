This article introduces the [[definitions_of_work_and_energy | concepts of work and energy]] in a physics context, noting their relationship and providing quantitative definitions through equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Defining Work and Energy

In everyday language, "work" and "energy" have common meanings, but in physics, they have specific definitions, though these can appear somewhat circular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

*   **Work** is defined as [[energy_concepts | energy]] transferred by a force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   **Energy** is defined as the ability to do [[work_in_physics | work]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

These definitions highlight that [[work_in_physics | work]] and [[energy_concepts | energy]] are deeply interconnected concepts used to describe motion and force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. To gain a more quantitative understanding, we turn to the equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## Work in Mechanics

The definition of [[work_in_physics | work]] in mechanics is:

`Work = Force × Distance` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>

### Units of Work

*   If force is measured in Newtons and distance in meters, the unit for [[work_in_physics | work]] is Newton-meters (Nm) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   A Newton-meter is also defined as one Joule (J) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   Joule is the standard unit for both [[work_in_physics | work]] and [[energy_concepts | energy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

### Example: Calculating Work

Imagine applying a force of 10 Newtons to a block and moving it 7 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
The [[work_in_physics | work]] done on the block (or the [[energy_concepts | energy]] transferred to it) is:

`Work = 10 Newtons × 7 meters = 70 Newton-meters = 70 Joules` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>

## Kinetic Energy

[[kinetic_energy_formula | Kinetic energy]] is a form of [[energy_concepts | energy]] associated with motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. It represents the [[work_in_physics | work]] needed to accelerate an object from being stationary to its current velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

### Derivation of the Kinetic Energy Formula

Consider a block of mass 'm' that starts at rest ($v_i = 0$) and is pushed by a constant force 'F' over a distance 'd' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Since a force causes acceleration ($F=ma$), the block will attain some final velocity ($v_f$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

1.  **Kinematics Equation**: From kinematics, we know that for an object accelerating over a distance:
    `vf^2 = vi^2 + 2ad` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>
    Since the initial velocity ($v_i$) is 0, the equation simplifies to:
    `vf^2 = 2ad` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>

2.  **Substitute Acceleration**: From Newton's second law ($F = ma$), acceleration ($a$) can be expressed as $a = F/m$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
    Substitute this into the equation:
    `vf^2 = 2 (F/m) d` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>

3.  **Identify Work**: Rearrange the equation:
    `vf^2 = (2 * F * d) / m` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>
    We recognize that `Force × Distance` is the definition of [[work_in_physics | work]] (`W = Fd`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
    So, we can substitute `W` for `F * d`:
    `vf^2 = (2 * W) / m` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>

4.  **Solve for Work**: Multiply both sides by 'm' and divide by 2:
    `m * vf^2 = 2 * W` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>
    `W = (1/2) * m * vf^2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>

This final formula, `1/2 mv^2`, is the [[kinetic_energy_formula | kinetic energy]] formula, representing the [[work_in_physics | work]] done to bring an object to a certain velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

### The Kinetic Energy Formula

The [[kinetic_energy_formula | kinetic energy]] ($KE$) of an object is given by:

`KE = (1/2)mv^2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>

Where:
*   `m` is the mass of the object (in kilograms).
*   `v` is the velocity of the object (in meters per second).

Like [[work_in_physics | work]], [[kinetic_energy_formula | kinetic energy]] is measured in Joules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

In subsequent discussions, other forms of [[energy_concepts | energy]] and the [[energy_concepts | law of conservation of energy]] will be introduced, which explains how different forms of [[energy_concepts | energy]] can be converted into one another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

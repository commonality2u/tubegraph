[[DNA and cell function | DNA's structure]], a double helix described as a twisted ladder, makes it suitable as the molecular basis of heredity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This video aims to provide a conceptual understanding of why [[DNA and cell function | DNA]] is suitable for heredity and the mechanism by which it functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## DNA Structure
A [[DNA and cell function | DNA]] molecule is far more extensive than just a few base pairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. It can be tens of millions of base pairs long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, with some molecules containing up to 70 million base pairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

While the terms [[DNA and cell function | DNA]], chromosome, and gene are related, they refer to distinct entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>:
*   **DNA** is the specific molecule with a sugar-phosphate backbone and a sequence of base pairs, forming a double helix structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   A **chromosome** refers to a [[DNA and cell function | DNA]] molecule that is packaged with other molecules and proteins, forming a broader structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   A **gene** is a specific section of [[DNA and cell function | DNA]] that codes for a certain type of protein, thereby expressing a particular trait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Genes can vary in length from several thousand to millions of base pairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## DNA Replication
For [[DNA and cell function | DNA]] to serve as the molecular basis of heredity, it must be replicable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This ensures that when a cell divides, the two new cells receive identical genetic material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. This process is known as **replication** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

The conceptual idea of [[DNA and cell function | DNA]] replication involves splitting the two sides of the double helix "ladder" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Each of these separated sides then serves as a template to construct a new complementary side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

The rules for base pairing in [[DNA and cell function | DNA]] are fundamental to replication:
*   Adenine (A) always pairs with Thymine (T) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   Thymine (T) pairs with Adenine (A) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   Guanine (G) pairs with Cytosine (C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   Cytosine (C) pairs with Guanine (G) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

By following these pairing rules, each original half of the [[DNA and cell function | DNA]] ladder can be used to construct a new, complementary half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This process results in the creation of two identical [[DNA and cell function | DNA]] strands from a single original strand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. This is the conceptual basis of how [[DNA and cell function | DNA]] is replicated before a cell undergoes division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

## Gene Expression (Briefly)
While replication ensures the passing of genetic information, the information itself must be expressed to define an organism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Gene expression involves two main steps:
1.  **Transcription**: The process where a section of [[DNA and cell function | DNA]] (a gene) is copied into a messenger [[Role of RNA in genetic processes | RNA]] (mRNA) molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. This mRNA carries the genetic information out of the nucleus in eukaryotic cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. In [[Role of RNA in genetic processes | RNA]], Adenine (A) pairs with Uracil (U) instead of Thymine (T), but Guanine (G) and Cytosine (C) still pair with each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.
2.  **Translation**: The mRNA molecule, once outside the nucleus, attaches to a ribosome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. Here, the sequence of bases in the mRNA is translated into an amino acid sequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. Every three bases on the mRNA, known as a codon, codes for a specific amino acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. There are 64 possible codons, which code for the 20 possible amino acids, with some redundancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. Another type of [[Role of RNA in genetic processes | RNA]], transfer [[Role of RNA in genetic processes | RNA]] (tRNA), helps match these codons to their corresponding amino acids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. The linked amino acids then form a protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. Proteins are essential molecules that perform many functions, acting as enzymes or structural components, thereby "doing the work of life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

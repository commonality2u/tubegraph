To effectively divide into larger numbers, a foundational understanding of [[importance_of_multiplication_tables_for_division|multiplication tables]] is essential, ideally from 1x1 up to at least 10x10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This knowledge allows for quick recall of basic division facts.

For example:
*   To divide 25 by 5, one considers "5 times what is 25?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Since 5 x 5 = 25, the answer is 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.
*   Similarly, for 49 divided by 7, the question is "7 times what equals 49?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. The answer is 7 because 7 x 7 = 49 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.
*   For 54 divided by 9, you consider "9 times what equals 54?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. Knowing multiplication tables or using reasoning (e.g., 9x5=45, so 9x6=54) gives the answer as 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.

## When Division Is Not Exact: Introducing Remainders

Not all division problems result in a whole number. When a number cannot be divided "cleanly" by another, there is a remainder.

Consider dividing 23 by 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
If you list the multiples of 3 (3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24...), you'll notice that 23 is not a multiple of 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
To perform this division:
1.  Find the largest multiple of 3 that is less than or equal to 23. This is 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
2.  Determine how many times 3 goes into 21. Since 3 x 7 = 21, it goes in 7 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
3.  Calculate the remainder by subtracting the multiple from the original number: 23 - 21 = 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
4.  The result is expressed as the quotient and the remainder: 23 divided by 3 equals 7 remainder 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## [[long_division_with_larger_numbers|Long Division]] and Implicit Remainders

When dealing with larger numbers, the concept of a remainder is applied step-by-step within the [[stepbystep_process_of_long_division|long division process]].

### Example 1: 344 รท 4

To divide 344 by 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>:
1.  **Divide the first digit**: 4 goes into 3 zero times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
2.  **Consider the first two digits**: How many times does 4 go into 34?
    *   4 x 8 = 32
    *   4 x 9 = 36
    Since 36 is too large, 4 goes into 34 eight times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Write "8" above the "4" in 344 (in the tens place) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
3.  **Multiply and Subtract**: 8 x 4 = 32. Subtract 32 from 34, leaving 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
4.  **Bring Down**: Bring down the next digit (4) to form 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
5.  **Repeat**: How many times does 4 go into 24?
    *   4 x 6 = 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. Write "6" above the "4" (in the ones place) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
6.  **Multiply and Subtract**: 6 x 4 = 24. Subtract 24 from 24, leaving 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
7.  Since the remainder is 0, the division is exact: 344 divided by 4 is 86 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

### Example 2: 91 รท 7

To divide 91 by 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>:
1.  **Divide the first digit**: How many times does 7 go into 9? It goes in 1 time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. Write "1" above the "9" (in the tens place) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
2.  **Multiply and Subtract**: 1 x 7 = 7. Subtract 7 from 9, leaving 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
3.  **Bring Down**: Bring down the next digit (1) to form 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
4.  **Repeat**: How many times does 7 go into 21?
    *   7 x 3 = 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. Write "3" above the "1" (in the ones place) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
5.  **Multiply and Subtract**: 3 x 7 = 21. Subtract 21 from 21, leaving 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
6.  The result is 13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

### Example 3: 608 รท 8

To divide 608 by 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>:
1.  **Divide the first digit**: 8 goes into 6 zero times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
2.  **Consider the first two digits**: How many times does 8 go into 60?
    *   8 x 7 = 56
    *   8 x 8 = 64
    Since 64 is too large, 8 goes into 60 seven times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. Write "7" above the "0" in 608 (in the tens place) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
3.  **Multiply and Subtract**: 7 x 8 = 56. Subtract 56 from 60, leaving 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
4.  **Bring Down**: Bring down the next digit (8) to form 48 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
5.  **Repeat**: How many times does 8 go into 48?
    *   8 x 6 = 48 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. Write "6" above the "8" (in the ones place) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.
6.  **Multiply and Subtract**: 6 x 8 = 48. Subtract 48 from 48, leaving 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
7.  The result is 76 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

Mastering [[long_division_with_larger_numbers|long division]] primarily relies on a solid understanding of [[importance_of_multiplication_tables_for_division|multiplication tables]] to efficiently handle the smaller division steps and manage intermediate remainders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

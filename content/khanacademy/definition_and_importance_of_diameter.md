The [[properties_of_a_circle | circle]] is a fundamental shape in the universe, appearing in everything from planetary orbits to molecular structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. To understand its [[properties_of_a_circle | properties]], key measurements like the diameter are essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## What is Diameter?

The diameter is the distance across the widest point of a [[properties_of_a_circle | circle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. It represents the length of a straight line segment that passes through the exact center of the [[properties_of_a_circle | circle]] and connects two points on its edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. There are multiple places where one could cut a [[properties_of_a_circle | circle]] along its widest point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## Relationship with Radius

The diameter has a straightforward relationship with the [[definition_and_importance_of_radius | radius]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Since the widest point of a [[properties_of_a_circle | circle]] passes through its center, it is essentially composed of two [[definition_and_importance_of_radius | radii]] placed end-to-end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

Therefore, the relationship is:
$$ \text{Diameter} = 2 \times \text{Radius} $$
Or, expressed as a formula:
$$ D = 2r $$
For example, if the [[definition_and_importance_of_radius | radius]] of a [[properties_of_a_circle | circle]] is 3 meters, its diameter will be 6 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

## Relationship with Circumference (Pi)

Historically, people measured the [[understanding_circumference | circumference]] (the distance around a [[properties_of_a_circle | circle]]) and the diameter of various [[properties_of_a_circle | circles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. They discovered a consistent [[introduction_to_pi_and_its_significance | ratio]] between the [[understanding_circumference | circumference]] and the diameter, regardless of the [[properties_of_a_circle | circle]]'s size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

This constant [[introduction_to_pi_and_its_significance | ratio]] is known as [[introduction_to_pi_and_its_significance | Pi]] (π) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
$$ \frac{\text{Circumference}}{\text{Diameter}} = \pi $$
This can be rearranged to express the [[understanding_circumference | circumference]] in terms of the diameter:
$$ \text{Circumference} = \pi \times \text{Diameter} $$
Or:
$$ C = \pi D $$
Since $D = 2r$, this can also be written as $C = 2 \pi r$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

### Practical Application

If you know the [[understanding_circumference | circumference]] of a [[properties_of_a_circle | circle]], you can find its diameter. For example, if a [[properties_of_a_circle | circle]] has a [[understanding_circumference | circumference]] of 10 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>:
$$ \pi \times \text{Diameter} = 10 \text{ meters} $$
To find the diameter, divide the [[understanding_circumference | circumference]] by [[introduction_to_pi_and_its_significance | Pi]]:
$$ \text{Diameter} = \frac{10}{\pi} \text{ meters} $$
This value, $\frac{10}{\pi}$ meters, is a numerical value that can be calculated using the approximate value of [[introduction_to_pi_and_its_significance | Pi]] (e.g., 3.14159) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. Often, for simplicity, results involving [[introduction_to_pi_and_its_significance | Pi]] are left in terms of the symbol π <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

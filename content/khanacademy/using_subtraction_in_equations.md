When solving [[understanding_mathematical_equations | mathematical equations]] that involve addition or subtraction alongside multiplication, the first step is often to use subtraction (or addition) to [[isolating_the_variable_in_an_equation | isolate the term with the variable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. The fundamental principle is that whatever operation you perform on one side of the equation, you must perform on the other side to maintain equality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Example 1: Subtracting a Positive Number

Consider the equation:
`3x + 5 = 17` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>

In this equation, the `+ 5` term needs to be eliminated to [[isolating_the_variable_in_an_equation | isolate the `3x` term]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

To do this, [[using_algebraic_steps_to_solve_equations | subtract 5]] from both sides of the equation:
`3x + 5 - 5 = 17 - 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>

On the left side, `+5` and `-5` cancel out, leaving `3x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
On the right side, `17 - 5` equals `12` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

The equation simplifies to:
`3x = 12` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>

From this point, you would proceed with [[dividing_to_solve_equations | division]] to find the value of `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

## Example 2: Adding to Counteract Subtraction

Consider a more complex equation involving negative numbers:
`7x - 2 = -10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>

The goal is to [[isolating_the_variable_in_an_equation | get rid of the `-2`]] on the left side to simplify the equation to just `7x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

To eliminate a subtraction, you add the same value to both sides. In this case, [[using_algebraic_steps_to_solve_equations | add 2]] to both sides of the equation:
`7x - 2 + 2 = -10 + 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>

On the left side, `-2` and `+2` cancel out, leaving `7x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
On the right side, `-10 + 2` equals `-8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   When [[handling_equations_with_negative_numbers | dealing with negative numbers]], remember that adding a positive number moves you to the right on a number line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Starting at -10 and adding 2 means moving two steps towards the positive direction, landing on -8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. This is part of [[understanding_subtracting_a_negative_is_the_same_as_adding_a_positive | understanding subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive]].

The equation simplifies to:
`7x = -8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>

From here, you would use [[multiplication_and_division_in_equations | division]] to solve for `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. The solution would be `x = -8/7` or `x = -1 and 1/7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

> [!Tip] Maintaining Equality
> The core principle for [[simplifying_algebraic_equations_involving_fractions | simplifying algebraic equations]] is that any operation performed on one side of the equation must also be performed on the other side to keep the equation balanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

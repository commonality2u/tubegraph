[[introduction_to_grammar | Grammar]] is understood as a set of conventions and rules that govern language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. One of its fundamental characteristics is that it is context-dependent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Rules vs. Conventions

The concept of grammar being context-dependent can be understood by differentiating between rules and conventions:
*   **Rules** are the fundamental requirements for language to be comprehensible to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. For example, for a car to move forward as intended, its wheels must be on the bottom, not the roof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Similarly, in language, rules ensure basic understanding.
*   **Conventions** are practices that are not necessarily universally true or essential for understanding, but are established norms within a specific context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. An analogy is the idea that all cars should be painted teal; it's a convention, not a rule essential for the car's function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## The Dynamic Nature of Grammar

The type of grammar used changes throughout the day, depending on several factors:
*   **Who** you are talking to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>
*   **What** you are trying to say <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>
*   **How** you are trying to say it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>

Due to these variables, individuals utilize multiple kinds of grammar throughout their daily lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Most people already possess significant grammatical knowledge from simply existing and interacting with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>; if one can understand spoken English, they know a great deal about grammar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Purpose of Studying Grammar

The aim of studying grammar is not to dictate "right" or "wrong" forms of English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Instead, the goal is to provide tools for individuals to [[empowerment_through_language | harness language]]—specifically English—and use it in any way they desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This approach focuses on ensuring the "wheels are on straight" (adhering to fundamental rules) rather than dictating the "color of the car" (conventions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Focus of These Videos

While acknowledging that grammar is context-dependent and "there are many englishes"—all of which are "great," "wonderful," "vibrant," "important," and "special" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>—these particular videos will focus on [[standard_american_english | Standard American English]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The intention is to give names to existing knowledge, thereby providing a greater command over language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

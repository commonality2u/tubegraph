Humans have recognized the existence of different substances in their environment for thousands of years, observing that these substances possess distinct properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These properties can include how a substance reflects light, its color, its state (liquid, gas, or solid) at a certain temperature, and how it [[chemical_reactions | reacts]] with other substances under specific circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

Examples of substances include carbon (in its graphite form), lead, and gold, all of which are depicted in their solid state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Air also consists of different types of particles, such as carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen, each with unique properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Substances can change states; for instance, gold or lead can become liquid when heated sufficiently, and carbon can turn into a gaseous state when burned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Elements: The Fundamental Substances

A key question arises: if a substance like carbon is continuously broken down into smaller and smaller pieces, is there a smallest unit that still retains the properties of carbon? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a> The answer is yes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. These pure substances with specific properties and reactive behaviors are called [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | elements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Carbon, lead, and gold are examples of [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | elements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Historically, water was considered an [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | element]], but it is now known to be composed of more fundamental [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | elements]]: oxygen and hydrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

All known [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | elements]] are systematically organized in the [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | Periodic Table of Elements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. For example, 'C' represents carbon, 'O' is oxygen, 'N' is nitrogen, 'Si' is silicon, 'Au' is gold, and 'Pb' is lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Atoms: The Basic Units of Elements

The most basic unit of any [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | element]] is the **atom** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. If you were to continuously divide a substance, you would eventually reach an atom of that [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | element]] (e.g., a carbon atom, a gold atom, or a lead atom) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. This atom cannot be further broken down while retaining the original substance's properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

Atoms are incredibly smallâ€”unimaginably small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. For instance, the width of an average human hair is approximately 1 million carbon atoms wide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Most living things, including human hair, are primarily composed of carbon atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

## [[fundamental_particles_of_atoms | Fundamental Particles]] of an Atom

Atoms themselves are composed of even more [[fundamental_particles_of_atoms | fundamental particles]]: protons, neutrons, and electrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. The arrangement and number of these particles determine an [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | element]]'s properties and can even change the [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | element]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

### Protons
The **proton** is the defining particle of an [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | element]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. The number of protons in an atom's nucleus is called the atomic number, which is literally the number displayed at the top for each [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | element]] in the [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | Periodic Table]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. For example:
*   Hydrogen has one proton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   Helium has two protons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
*   Carbon has six protons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   Oxygen has eight protons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

Changing the number of protons changes the [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | element]] itself; for instance, adding a proton to carbon (6 protons) would make it nitrogen (7 protons) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Protons carry a positive electrical charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

### Neutrons
**Neutrons** are also located in the center of the atom, along with protons, forming the **nucleus** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Unlike protons and electrons, neutrons are electrically neutral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. The number of neutrons in an atom can vary without changing the [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | element]]. For example, Carbon-12 has six protons and six neutrons, while Carbon-14 still has six protons but has eight neutrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. The number after the [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | element]]'s name (e.g., -12 in Carbon-12) represents the total number of protons and neutrons in its nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

### Electrons
**Electrons** are the third type of [[fundamental_particles_of_atoms | fundamental particle]] in an atom. In a neutral atom, the number of electrons equals the number of protons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Electrons are imagined to be moving or "buzzing" around the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. Electrons carry a negative electrical charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

### Electrical Charge and Atomic Structure
The attraction between oppositely charged particles (protons and electrons) keeps electrons bound to the nucleus, forming the atom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. Electrons move at incredibly high velocities, preventing them from falling into the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

The number and configuration of electrons largely determine how atoms interact and engage in [[chemical_reactions | chemical reactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. For instance, if an atom loses an electron, it will have more protons than electrons, resulting in a net positive charge. Such charged atoms are called ions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. Understanding these [[fundamental_particles_of_atoms | fundamental particles]] and their interactions is crucial for comprehending [[introduction_to_chemistry | chemistry]] and [[chemical_reactions_and_equations | chemical reactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

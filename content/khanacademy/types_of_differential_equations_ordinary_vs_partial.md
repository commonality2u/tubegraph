From: [[khanacademy]] <br/> 

Differential equations can be broadly classified into two main types: ordinary and partial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. This classification depends on the number of independent variables involved in the [[functionbased_solutions_to_differential_equations | function]] and its [[differential_calculus_and_its_applications | derivatives]] within the [[understanding_differential_equations_and_their_solutions | equation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

## Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)

An ordinary [[introduction_to_differential_equations | differential equation]] (ODE) is characterized by involving a [[functionbased_solutions_to_differential_equations | function]] of only one independent variable and its [[differential_calculus_and_its_applications | derivatives]] with respect to that single variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. In such equations, one variable is expressed with respect to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. For example, if a [[functionbased_solutions_to_differential_equations | function]] `y` depends only on `x` (e.g., `y(x)`), then an equation like `dy/dx` or `y'` would be part of an ODE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

Example of an ODE:
```
y' + y = x + 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
```
Here, `y` is an unknown [[functionbased_solutions_to_differential_equations | function]] of `x`, and `y'` is its first [[differential_calculus_and_its_applications | derivative]] with respect to `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)

Partial [[introduction_to_differential_equations | differential equations]] (PDEs) are more complex and involve a [[functionbased_solutions_to_differential_equations | function]] that depends on more than one independent variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. Consequently, they involve partial [[differential_calculus_and_its_applications | derivatives]] of the [[functionbased_solutions_to_differential_equations | function]] with respect to each of these independent variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. For instance, a [[functionbased_solutions_to_differential_equations | function]] could have [[differential_calculus_and_its_applications | derivatives]] with respect to `x`, `y`, and `z` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

## Scope of this Playlist

This particular playlist focuses exclusively on [[understanding_differential_equations_and_their_solutions | ordinary differential equations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. While the video series will not delve into partial differential equations, it will cover other classifications of ODEs, such as their [[order_of_a_differential_equation | order]] and whether they are [[classification_of_differential_equations_linear_vs_nonlinear | linear or non-linear]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

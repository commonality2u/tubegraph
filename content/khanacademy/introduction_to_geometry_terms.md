Geometry is a fundamental branch of mathematics that focuses on understanding shapes, space, and how various visual and mathematical elements relate to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## What is Geometry?

The word "geometry" itself provides insight into its meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>:
*   **Geo**: Refers to "earth," as seen in words like geography and geology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Metry**: Comes from "measurement," similar to [[Introduction to trigonometry | trigonometry]] or the metric system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
Thus, geometry literally means "earth measurement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The field encompasses the study of [[basic_geometry_involving_right_angles_and_equal_sides | lines]], triangles, circles, angles, patterns, and three-dimensional shapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Fundamental Geometric Concepts

### Point
A [[rays_and_lines_in_geometry | point]] is the most basic building block in geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   **Definition**: A point is simply a position and is represented by a dot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   **Movement**: One cannot move on a point; if you move in any direction, you are no longer at that point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Naming**: Points are typically labeled with capital letters (e.g., Point A, Point B) to distinguish them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### Line Segment
A line segment is a collection of all points connecting two distinct points along a straight path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **Endpoints**: The two distinct points that define a line segment are called its endpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **Notation**: A line segment is denoted by its endpoints with a line drawn above them, e.g., $\overline{AB}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. The order of letters does not matter (e.g., $\overline{AB}$ is the same as $\overline{BA}$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   **Length**: The length or distance of a line segment is indicated by writing its endpoints without the line above, followed by a numerical value, e.g., $AB = 5$ units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

### Ray
A [[rays_and_lines_in_geometry | ray]] is a part of a line that has one endpoint and extends infinitely in one direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   **Vertex**: The starting point of a ray is called its vertex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   **Notation**: A ray is denoted by its starting point followed by another point on the ray, with an arrow indicating the direction of infinite extension, e.g., $\overrightarrow{AD}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
*   **Order Matters**: The order of letters is crucial for rays; $\overrightarrow{AD}$ is different from $\overrightarrow{DA}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

### Line
A [[rays_and_lines_in_geometry | line]] extends infinitely in both directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   **No Endpoints**: Unlike a line segment, a line has no endpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   **Notation**: A line is denoted by two points on the line with a double-headed arrow above them, e.g., $\overleftrightarrow{EF}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
*   **Collinear Points**: Points that lie on the same line are called collinear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

### Midpoint
A midpoint is a point that divides a line segment into two equal segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
*   **Definition**: If a point Z is collinear with points X and Y, and the distance from X to Z is equal to the distance from Z to Y ($XZ = ZY$), then Z is the midpoint of line segment XY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

## Dimensions in Geometry

### Zero Dimensions (Point)
A point has zero dimensions because one cannot move in any direction (up/down, left/right, in/out) while remaining on the point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. It only specifies a position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

### One Dimension (Line, Line Segment, Ray)
One-dimensional objects allow movement in a single direction (back and forth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.
*   A line segment has length but no width <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
*   [[Rays and lines in geometry | Lines]], line segments, and rays are all one-dimensional concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

### Two Dimensions (Plane)
Two-dimensional objects allow movement in two different directions, such as left/right and up/down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
*   **Plane**: A plane is a flat surface that extends infinitely in all directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. A computer screen or a piece of paper, while finite, represents a two-dimensional surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

### Three Dimensions
Three-dimensional space includes movement in three directions: left/right, up/down, and in/out of the viewing plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

### Higher Dimensions
In advanced mathematics, concepts with more than three dimensions can be studied, though they are difficult to visualize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

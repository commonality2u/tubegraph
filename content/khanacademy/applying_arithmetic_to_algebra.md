[[introduction_to_algebra | Algebra]] often involves applying familiar [[understanding_arithmetic_and_expressions | arithmetic]] concepts to expressions containing variables. Many [[algebraic_operations_and_their_legitimacy | algebraic operations]] are direct extensions of principles learned in [[understanding_arithmetic_and_expressions | arithmetic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Simplifying Expressions Using the Distributive Property

When simplifying [[understanding_equivalent_expressions_in_algebra | algebraic expressions]], the distributive property is a fundamental tool.

Consider the expression `2(3x + 5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
This expression literally means two instances of `(3x + 5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
It can be expanded as `(3x + 5) + (3x + 5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
By looking at the terms, we can see there are two `3x` terms and two `5` terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>:
`2(3x) + 2(5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

This process is exactly the distributive property from [[understanding_arithmetic_and_expressions | arithmetic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
Performing the [[solving_arithmetic_expressions_using_order_of_operations | arithmetic operations]]:
*   `2 * 3x = 6x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>
*   `2 * 5 = 10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>

Therefore, `2(3x + 5)` simplifies to `6x + 10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## More Involved Examples

For more complex expressions, the same [[algebraic_methods_in_algebra | algebraic methods]] apply, requiring careful application of [[understanding_arithmetic_and_expressions | arithmetic]] rules, especially concerning signs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

Consider the expression: `7(3y - 5) - 2(10 + 4y)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### Step 1: Distribute on the Left Side

Distribute `7` across `(3y - 5)`:
*   `7 * 3y = 21y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>
*   `7 * -5 = -35` (remembering the sign) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>
So, `7(3y - 5)` becomes `21y - 35` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### Step 2: Distribute on the Right Side

It's helpful to think of distributing `-2` across `(10 + 4y)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>:
*   `-2 * 10 = -20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>
*   `-2 * 4y = -8y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>
So, `-2(10 + 4y)` becomes `-20 - 8y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

The expression is now: `21y - 35 - 20 - 8y`.

### Step 3: Combine Like Terms

Identify terms that have the same variable part (like terms) and constant terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

*   **Combine `y` terms:**
    *   `21y - 8y = 13y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>
*   **Combine constant terms:**
    *   `-35 - 20 = -55` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>

The fully simplified expression is `13y - 55` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. This process demonstrates how [[algebraic_methods_in_algebra | algebraic methods]], including the distributive property and combining like terms, are rooted in [[understanding_arithmetic_and_expressions | arithmetic]] principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

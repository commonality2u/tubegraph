[[Balancing chemical equations | Balancing chemical equations]] is a concept in chemistry that can often be confusing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, by working carefully and methodically, one can appreciate the "art" of this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## What is a Chemical Equation?

A chemical equation describes a reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. For instance, when an atom of aluminum reacts with a dioxygen molecule (two oxygen atoms), under appropriate conditions, they form aluminum oxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The aluminum oxide molecule contains two aluminum atoms and three oxygen atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Key Issues Addressed by Balancing

When looking at an unbalanced chemical equation, the primary issue is that the number of each type of atom is not the same on both sides of the reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

### Unequal Atom Counts

Consider the example of aluminum (Al) reacting with dioxygen (Oâ‚‚):

*   **Reactants (left side):** One aluminum atom, two oxygen atoms (in one dioxygen molecule) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.
*   **Products (right side):** Two aluminum atoms, three oxygen atoms (in one aluminum oxide molecule) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.

This presents a problem:
*   Aluminum cannot simply "appear out of thin air" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   Oxygen atoms cannot "miraculously appear out of nowhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

To correctly represent the reaction, the number of aluminum atoms and oxygen atoms must be balanced on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

### Dealing with Fractional Coefficients

A common point of confusion arises when an initial attempt to balance leads to fractional coefficients. For example, to balance the oxygen atoms from two to three, one might consider multiplying the dioxygen molecule by 1.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

However, a fundamental convention in [[balancing_chemical_equations | balancing chemical equations]] is that **we do not use fractional coefficients** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. The notion of "1.5 molecules" or a "half molecule" is considered bizarre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. The goal is always to have **whole number molecules** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

To resolve this, much like in algebra, one can multiply all coefficients in the equation by a common number (e.g., two) to eliminate the fraction and achieve whole numbers for all molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. For example, if a 1.5 coefficient exists, multiplying all coefficients by two will convert 1.5 into 3, and any other integer coefficients will also double <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. This ensures the equation remains balanced while adhering to the convention of whole numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

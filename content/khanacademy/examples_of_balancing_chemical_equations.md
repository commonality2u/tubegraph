[[balancing_chemical_equations | Balancing chemical equations]] can initially seem confusing, but with a methodical approach, it becomes manageable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It's often viewed as an art form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## What is a Chemical Equation?

A [[understanding_chemical_equations_and_reactions | chemical equation]] describes a reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. For example, if aluminum (Al) atoms are added to dioxygen (O₂) molecules under the right conditions, they react to form aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. An aluminum oxide molecule consists of two aluminum atoms and three oxygen atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

Here's the initial, unbalanced equation:
Al + O₂ → Al₂O₃ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>

## Why Balance Chemical Equations?

The reason for [[balancing_chemical_equations | balancing chemical equations]] is that the number of each type of atom must be the same on both sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Atoms cannot simply appear or disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, reflecting the principle of conservation of mass.

Let's count the atoms in the unbalanced equation:
*   **Aluminum (Al):**
    *   Left-hand side (reactants): 1 atom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>
    *   Right-hand side (products): 2 atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>
*   **Oxygen (O):**
    *   Left-hand side (reactants): 2 atoms (in one dioxygen molecule) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>
    *   Right-hand side (products): 3 atoms (in one aluminum oxide molecule) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>

Since the numbers of aluminum and oxygen atoms are not equal on both sides, the equation needs to be balanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## [[steps_to_balance_chemical_equations | Steps to Balance Chemical Equations]]

### Step 1: Balance Initial Atoms
To begin [[balancing_chemical_equations | balancing]], start with the atoms that are not equal.

For aluminum, we have 1 Al on the left and 2 Al on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. To balance this, we can place a coefficient of 2 in front of the aluminum on the left:
**2**Al + O₂ → Al₂O₃ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>

Now, aluminum is balanced with 2 atoms on each side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

### Step 2: Address Other Atoms and Fractional Coefficients

Next, consider oxygen. We have 2 oxygen atoms on the left (O₂) and 3 oxygen atoms on the right (Al₂O₃) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

To get 3 oxygen atoms from a dioxygen molecule (O₂), we could multiply O₂ by 1.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>:
2Al + **1.5**O₂ → Al₂O₃ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>

This would give 3 oxygen atoms on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

### Step 3: Eliminate Fractional Coefficients

A common convention in chemistry is to avoid [[dealing_with_fractional_coefficients_in_chemical_equations | writing "1.5 molecules"]] or any other fractional coefficients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. We want whole number molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

To achieve this, multiply all coefficients in the equation by a common factor that eliminates the fraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. In this case, multiplying by 2 will convert 1.5 to a whole number:
(2Al) * 2 + (1.5O₂) * 2 → (Al₂O₃) * 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>

This results in the balanced equation:
**4**Al + **3**O₂ → **2**Al₂O₃ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>

## Verifying the Balanced Equation

Let's re-check the atom count for the balanced equation:
*   **Reactants** (left-hand side): [[understanding_reactants_and_products_in_chemical_reactions | 4Al + 3O₂]]
    *   Aluminum (Al): 4 atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>
    *   Oxygen (O): 3 molecules of O₂ means 3 * 2 = 6 atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>
*   **Products** (right-hand side): [[understanding_reactants_and_products_in_chemical_reactions | 2Al₂O₃]]
    *   Aluminum (Al): 2 molecules of Al₂O₃ means 2 * 2 = 4 atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>
    *   Oxygen (O): 2 molecules of Al₂O₃ means 2 * 3 = 6 atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>

Both aluminum and oxygen atoms are now balanced on both sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

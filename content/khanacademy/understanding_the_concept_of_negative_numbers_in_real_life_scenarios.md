When first encountered, negative numbers can seem mysterious and abstract, especially since initial counting focuses on positive numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. However, negative numbers are commonly encountered in everyday life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Generally, a [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negative number]] is any number less than zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

### Temperature
Negative numbers are frequently used when measuring temperature, whether in Celsius or Fahrenheit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

Consider an example:
*   If the temperature is 3 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   And it gets 4 degrees colder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   The temperature would decrease from 3 to 2 (1 degree colder) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, then to 1 (2 degrees colder) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, then to 0 (3 degrees colder) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   To reach 4 degrees colder, it must go one more degree below 0, resulting in **negative 1 degree Celsius** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

On a [[visualizing_negative_numbers_on_a_number_line | number line]], values increase as you move right from 0 and become more negative as you move left from 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. For example, negative 3 is less than negative 1, meaning it is colder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Similarly, negative 100 is much smaller than negative 1, indicating a greater lack of heat or a much colder temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Banking and Finances
Negative numbers are also used to represent financial situations where money is owed, often referred to as debt or being "in the red" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

Consider an example:
*   Starting with $10 in a bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   Spending $30 from that account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   This means $20 had to come from the bank, which you now owe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   The bank account balance would be $10 minus $30, which equals **negative $20** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   A balance of negative $20 signifies that you owe the bank money; you not only have nothing, but you are in debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

The [[visualizing_negative_numbers_on_a_number_line | number line]] is a useful tool for understanding [[how_to_add_and_subtract_negative_numbers | how to add and subtract negative numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
*   When subtracting, or concepts like getting colder or spending money, you move to the left on the number line, and numbers get smaller (more negative) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   When [[adding negative numbers | adding]], or concepts like getting warmer or receiving a paycheck, you move to the right on the number line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

Examples of [[how_to_add_and_subtract_negative_numbers | adding and subtracting negative numbers]] using a number line:
*   **3 - 4:** Starting at 3 and moving 4 units to the left results in **-1** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.
*   **2 - 8:** Starting at 2 and moving 8 units to the left: 2 units reach 0, and the remaining 6 units go past 0, resulting in **-6** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
*   **-4 - 2:** Starting at -4 and moving 2 units further to the left (subtracting 2) results in **-6** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **-3 + 2:** Starting at -3 and moving 2 units to the right (adding 2) results in **-1** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

Understanding these real-world applications helps grasp the fundamental concept of negative numbers and their behavior in mathematical operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

DNA's structure as a double helix, or twisted ladder, makes it well-suited to be the molecular basis of heredity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article conceptually explores why DNA is suitable for heredity and the mechanisms by which it functions in this role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. A DNA molecule can be incredibly long, potentially tens of millions of base pairs, far more than just a handful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## DNA Replication

For a molecule to be the basis of heredity, it must be replicable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. When a cell divides, the two new cells need to receive the same genetic material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The process by which DNA copies itself is called [[dna_replication_process | replication]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

Replication involves splitting the two sides of the DNA ladder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Each separated side then serves as a template to construct the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. The base pairing rules dictate this construction:
*   Adenine (A) always pairs with Thymine (T) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   Thymine (T) pairs with Adenine (A) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   Guanine (G) pairs with Cytosine (C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   Cytosine (C) pairs with Guanine (G) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

By following these rules, each original half of the DNA ladder constructs a new complementary half, resulting in two identical strands of DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. This ensures that the genetic information is duplicated accurately before a cell divides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

## Gene Expression

Beyond replication, the information within DNA must be used to define and express the organism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. This process is known as expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

### DNA, Chromosome, and Gene
It's important to differentiate related terms:
*   **DNA:** Refers to the specific double helix molecule with its sugar-phosphate backbone and sequence of base pairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **Chromosome:** A structured unit where a DNA molecule is packaged together with other molecules and proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   **Gene:** A specific section of DNA that codes for a certain trait or a particular type of protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Genes can range from several thousand to millions of base pairs long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

### The Role of RNA in Gene Expression

The information from a gene in DNA is expressed through a related molecule called [[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | RNA]] (Ribonucleic Acid) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Unlike DNA, RNA has a ribonucleic acid sugar backbone, differentiating it from DNA's deoxyribonucleic acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

In cells with [[dna_in_cells_and_the_role_of_nucleus | nuclei]], DNA typically remains within the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. To be expressed, its information must largely exit the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. This is where RNA, specifically messenger RNA (mRNA), acts as a messenger, carrying genetic information from a DNA section outside the nucleus to be translated into a protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

#### Transcription

The process of converting DNA information into mRNA is called transcription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Similar to DNA replication, one strand of the DNA molecule serves as a template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. However, when constructing an mRNA molecule:
*   Adenine (A) in DNA pairs with Uracil (U) in RNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   Thymine (T) in DNA pairs with Adenine (A) in RNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
*   Guanine (G) in DNA pairs with Cytosine (C) in RNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.
*   Cytosine (C) in DNA pairs with Guanine (G) in RNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

Once transcribed, the single strand of mRNA detaches and carries the genetic information from that section of DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

#### Translation

After transcription, the mRNA molecule leaves the nucleus and attaches to a [[structure_and_function_of_ribosomes | ribosome]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. The process of converting the mRNA base sequence into an amino acid sequence, which forms a protein, is called translation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

Each sequence of three bases on the mRNA molecule is called a **codon** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. Each codon codes for a specific amino acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. With four possible bases at each of the three positions in a codon, there are 4 x 4 x 4 = 64 possible codons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. This provides ample combinations to code for the 20 possible amino acids, with some amino acids being coded by more than one codon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.

Another type of RNA, transfer RNA (tRNA), plays a crucial role in translation by matching the codons on the mRNA with their corresponding amino acids and bringing them to the ribosome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. As amino acids are brought together in the sequence specified by the mRNA, they link up to form a protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

Proteins are fundamental molecules that perform most of the work of life, acting as enzymes, structural components, or forming tissues like muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. They can be thousands of amino acids long, forming complex shapes and functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. This entire process demonstrates how DNA stores and expresses the information for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.

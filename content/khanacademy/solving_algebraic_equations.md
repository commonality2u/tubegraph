When dealing with basic arithmetic, one encounters concrete numbers like 23 plus 5, where the numbers are known and can be calculated, such as 28 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, upon entering the [[understanding_relationships_and_equations_in_algebra | algebraic world]], the concept of variables is introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Introduction to Variables

Variables are values within expressions that can change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. For example, in the [[understanding_algebraic_expressions | expression]] `x + 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, its value depends on the value of `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   If `x = 1`, then `x + 5` evaluates to `1 + 5 = 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   If `x = -7`, then `x + 5` evaluates to `-7 + 5 = -2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

Here, `x` is a variable whose value changes based on the context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Other examples of expressions include `y + z`, where both `y` and `z` are variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. The value of an [[understanding_algebraic_expressions | expression]] can be evaluated by substituting specific values for each variable it contains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Expressions vs. Equations

It is important to distinguish between an [[understanding_algebraic_expressions | expression]] and an [[understanding_relationships_and_equations_in_algebra | equation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   An [[understanding_algebraic_expressions | expression]] is a statement of value or quantity, such as `x + 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Its value changes depending on the variable's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   An [[understanding_relationships_and_equations_in_algebra | equation]] sets two expressions equal to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, hence the term "equating" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

## Solving Simple Algebraic Equations

When an [[understanding_relationships_and_equations_in_algebra | equation]] has only one unknown, it is possible to determine the specific value the variable must take <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

For example, in the [[solving_simple_linear_equations | equation]] `x + 3 = 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>:
*   To solve this, one considers "what plus 3 equals 1?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   The answer is `x = -2`, because `-2 + 3 = 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
In this context, the [[understanding_relationships_and_equations_in_algebra | equation]] [[isolating_variables_in_algebraic_equations | constrains]] the value the variable `x` can take <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

[[understanding_systems_of_equations | Equations]] can also involve multiple variables, such as `x + y + z = 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. While this [[understanding_relationships_and_equations_in_algebra | equation]] places some constraints, if specific values for some variables are known, the remaining variable becomes constrained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

For instance, if `y = 3` and `z = 2` in the [[understanding_relationships_and_equations_in_algebra | equation]] `x + y + z = 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>:
1.  Substitute the known values: `x + 3 + 2 = 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
2.  Simplify the [[understanding_algebraic_expressions | expression]]: `x + 5 = 5` <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
3.  Now, the problem becomes "what plus 5 equals 5?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
4.  This [[isolating_variables_in_algebraic_equations | constrains]] `x` to be `0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

## Impact of Variables and Context

A key takeaway is that variables can assume different values depending on the specific problem's context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. This concept is further illustrated when evaluating more complex expressions:

*   **Expression**: `x^y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>
    *   If `x = 5` and `y = 2`, the [[understanding_algebraic_expressions | expression]] evaluates to `5^2 = 25` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
    *   If `x = -2` and `y = 3`, the [[understanding_algebraic_expressions | expression]] evaluates to `(-2)^3 = -2 * -2 * -2 = -8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

*   **Expression**: `sqrt(x + y) - x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>
    *   If `x = 1` and `y = 8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>:
        1.  Substitute values: `sqrt(1 + 8) - 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
        2.  Simplify inside the square root: `sqrt(9) - 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
        3.  Calculate the square root: `3 - 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
        4.  Final evaluation: `2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

In all these cases, [[algebraic_techniques_for_solving_equations | variables]] are assigned values based on the specific context of the problem or [[understanding_relationships_and_equations_in_algebra | equation]], leading to a defined outcome for the [[understanding_algebraic_expressions | expression]].

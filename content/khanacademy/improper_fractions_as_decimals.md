To [[converting_fractions_to_decimals | convert a fraction]] into a decimal, the general method involves dividing the denominator into the numerator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. This method applies universally, even for [[converting_improper_fractions_to_mixed_numbers | improper fractions]] where the numerator is larger than the denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:40">[02:40:40]</a>, resulting in a decimal value greater than one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:52">[02:52:52]</a>.

## Conversion Method

The process for [[converting_fractions_to_decimals | converting any fraction to a decimal]] is as follows:
1.  Take the denominator and divide it into the numerator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.
2.  Add a decimal point and trailing zeros to the numerator as needed to continue the division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>.

## Example: Converting 17/9 to a Decimal

Consider the improper fraction 17/9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:41">[02:41:41]</a>. Since the numerator (17) is larger than the denominator (9), the resulting decimal will be greater than 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:50">[02:50:50]</a>.

```

1.  Divide 9 into 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:05">[02:55:05]</a>. Add a decimal point and trailing zeros to 17 (e.g., 17.000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.
2.  9 goes into 17 one time (1 x 9 = 9) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:06">[03:06:06]</a>.
3.  Subtract 9 from 17, leaving 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:11">[03:11:11]</a>.
4.  Bring down a zero to make it 80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:14">[03:14:14]</a>.
5.  9 goes into 80 eight times (8 x 9 = 72) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:20">[03:20:20]</a>.
6.  Subtract 72 from 80, leaving 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:27">[03:27:27]</a>.
7.  Bring down another zero to make it 80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:29">[03:29:29]</a>.
8.  This process continues, as 9 will repeatedly go into 80 eight times, resulting in a remainder of 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:30">[03:30:30]</a>.

The decimal representation of 17/9 is 1.888... <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:46">[03:46:46]</a>.

### Representing [[repeating_decimals_as_rational_numbers | Repeating Decimals]]

When a decimal has a repeating pattern, such as the 8 in 1.888..., it can be represented by placing a line over the repeating digit or digits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:09">[02:09:09]</a>.

For 17/9, the exact answer is 1.8 with the 8 repeating indefinitely, commonly written as 1.8Ì… <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:46">[03:46:46]</a>. While it can be rounded (e.g., to 1.89 in the hundredths place), the repeating form is the exact representation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:02">[04:02:02]</a>.

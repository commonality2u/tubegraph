Al-Khwarizmi was a Persian mathematician who resided in Baghdad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a> during the 8th or 9th century, specifically writing his notable book in 820 AD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. His work is considered a cornerstone in the [[history_of_algebra_in_ancient_civilizations | history of algebra]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

## The "Compendious Book" and the [[Origins of algebra | Origins of Algebra]]

The [[origins of algebra | origins of algebra]], and the word itself, are closely associated with Al-Khwarizmi's influential book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The English translation of its title is "Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This book is widely regarded as very important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

### Etymology of "Algebra"

The term "algebra" derives from the Arabic word "Al-gabr" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, which means "restoration or completion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Al-Khwarizmi linked this term in his book to the operation of moving an element from one side of an equation to the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

The full title, when broken down from Arabic, reveals:
*   "Al-kitab" - book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>
*   "Al-mukhtasar" - compendious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>
*   "Fihisab" - calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>
*   "Al-gabr" - completion (the root of "algebra") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>
*   "Wa'l-muqabala" - balancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>

## Key Contributions to Algebra

Al-Khwarizmi's book is significant not only for being the first known use of the word "algebra" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a> but also because many consider it the first time that algebra began to incorporate many of its modern ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. These contributions include:
*   **Balancing Equations**: He introduced and formalized ideas related to balancing an equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **Abstract Problem Solving**: He shifted the focus towards the abstract problem itself, moving away from solving only specific, one-off problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. This approach more closely resembles how modern mathematicians conceptualize the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

### Al-Khwarizmi's Place in [[Significant historical figures in algebra | Historical Figures in Algebra]]

While Al-Khwarizmi is credited with the name "algebra" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>, the [[origins of algebra | origins of algebra]] predate him. The earliest known exploration of algebraic ideas comes from ancient Babylon around 2000 BCE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

Other significant figures in the [[history_of_algebra_in_ancient_civilizations | history of algebra]] include:
*   [[Diophantus and the development of algebra | Diophantus]], a Greek mathematician living in Alexandria around 200 to 300 AD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Some historians, particularly Western ones, consider him the father of algebra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. However, [[Diophantus and the development of algebra | Diophantus]] was more focused on particular problems, unlike Al-Khwarizmi's purer, more abstract approach to mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   Brahmagupta, an Indian mathematician around 600 AD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>, also made significant contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

Despite these predecessors, Al-Khwarizmi's contributions were unique and not merely a copy of earlier works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. He is frequently debated with [[Diophantus and the development of algebra | Diophantus]] for the title of "father of algebra" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, and is certainly considered one of its key figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

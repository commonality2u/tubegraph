## Understanding Bacterial Infections
[[Differences between eukaryotes and prokaryotes | Bacteria]] are microscopic cells that are considered living organisms, possessing metabolisms and the ability to move around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33:00">[13:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:36:00">[13:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:00">[13:40:00]</a>. When they cause infections, these cells move within the body and release toxins that lead to illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:55:00">[12:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>.

### The Role of Antibiotics
Antibiotics are medications specifically designed to kill [[Differences between eukaryotes and prokaryotes | bacteria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:03:00">[13:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:00">[13:18:00]</a>. However, responsible medical practice advises against prescribing antibiotics indiscriminately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:00">[13:26:00]</a>.

## The Development of Antibiotic Resistance
The excessive use of antibiotics can lead to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant [[Differences between eukaryotes and prokaryotes | bacteria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:29:00">[13:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:00">[13:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:44:00">[13:44:00]</a>. This phenomenon is an example of [[Realtime examples of evolution such as viruses and bacteria | natural selection]] in action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:00">[13:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:44:00">[13:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:00">[14:15:00]</a>.

### Variation in Bacterial Populations
Within any population of [[Differences between eukaryotes and prokaryotes | bacteria]], there is natural variation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59:00">[13:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01:00">[14:01:00]</a>. Occasionally, random changes or mutations occur in their DNA, resulting in slightly different versions of the [[Differences between eukaryotes and prokaryotes | bacteria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11:00">[14:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:00">[14:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:23:00">[15:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26:00">[15:26:00]</a>. While most of these variations make them equally pathogenic, some rare changes might make a [[Differences between eukaryotes and prokaryotes | bacterium]] resistant to a particular antibiotic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11:00">[14:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:00">[14:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26:00">[15:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:32:00">[15:32:00]</a>.

### How Resistance Spreads
When antibiotics are used, they effectively kill susceptible [[Differences between eukaryotes and prokaryotes | bacteria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:38:00">[14:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:00">[14:43:00]</a>. This eliminates the competition for the resistant variants, allowing them to replicate unhindered and rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:45:00">[14:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:57:00">[14:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:00">[15:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:36:00">[15:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:41:00">[15:41:00]</a>. Consequently, the resistant strain becomes the dominant form of [[Differences between eukaryotes and prokaryotes | bacteria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:41:00">[15:41:00]</a>.

### The Superbug Phenomenon
This process leads to the creation of "superbugs" â€“ [[Differences between eukaryotes and prokaryotes | bacteria]] against which previously effective antibiotics are now useless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:44:00">[15:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:49:00">[15:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52:00">[15:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:55:00">[15:55:00]</a>. It's crucial to understand that [[Misconceptions about evolution | superbugs]] do not actively design themselves to be resistant; rather, they arise from random changes, and our actions (overuse of antibiotics) inadvertently select for these resistant variants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:06:00">[15:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:00">[15:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:13:00">[15:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:17:00">[15:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:58:00">[15:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:00:00">[16:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:02:00">[16:02:00]</a>.

This constant mutation of [[Differences between eukaryotes and prokaryotes | bacteria]] means that heavy antibiotic use perpetually selects for strains unaffected by current drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09:00">[16:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:12:00">[16:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:14:00">[16:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:18:00">[16:18:00]</a>.

The kidney is an organ primarily known for its role in excreting waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Beyond waste excretion, the kidneys also help maintain the body's water levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, regulate the amount of salts or electrolytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, and contribute to blood pressure maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. They also produce hormones, though this is not detailed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Most individuals have two kidneys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## [[kidney_anatomy_and_location | Kidney Anatomy and Location]]

Kidneys are typically located closer to the back, on either side of the spine, and behind the liver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. When observed internally, the kidney is divided into distinct regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>:
*   **Renal Cortex**: The outer part of the kidney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The term "renal" always refers to the kidney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **Renal Medulla**: The inner, middle part of the kidney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

These regions play significant roles in the kidney's [[processes_of_blood_filtration_and_waste_excretion | filtration]] and waste excretion processes, as well as in regulating water balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

## The [[structure_and_function_of_the_nephron | Nephron]]: Functional Unit of the Kidney

The [[structure_and_function_of_the_nephron | nephron]] is considered the functional unit of the kidney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. It is at this microscopic level that the kidney's two major functions—waste excretion and water level maintenance in the blood—occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Each average kidney contains approximately one million [[structure_and_function_of_the_nephron | nephrons]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. A [[structure_and_function_of_the_nephron | nephron]] starts in the cortex, dips down into the medulla, and then returns to the cortex before draining into collecting ducts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

## [[processes_of_blood_filtration_and_waste_excretion | Processes of Blood Filtration and Waste Excretion]]

The process of [[processes_of_blood_filtration_and_waste_excretion | blood filtration]] begins within the [[structure_and_function_of_the_nephron | nephron]] as blood enters through an afferent arteriole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

### Glomerulus and Bowman's Capsule
The afferent arteriole leads into a dense capillary network called the glomerulus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. The glomerulus is highly porous and is surrounded by specialized cells called podocytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Blood enters the glomerulus at high pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. About one-fifth of the fluid from the blood is filtered out into the Bowman's space, which is part of the Bowman's capsule that encloses the glomerulus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. This filtered fluid, known as filtrate (or glomerular filtrate), contains small ions (like sodium), small molecules (like glucose), and amino acids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Larger components like red blood cells and large proteins are not filtered out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

### Proximal Tubule
After filtration, the filtrate moves into the proximal tubule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. This section of the [[structure_and_function_of_the_nephron | nephron]] is primarily responsible for reabsorbing essential substances that the body needs to retain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Substances reabsorbed include glucose, sodium, and amino acids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. This reabsorption is an active process that requires [[enzymes_involved_in_glycolysis | ATP]] (energy) to pump these substances back into the bloodstream, which is carried by nearby capillaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. Some water is also reabsorbed here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

### [[water_and_electrolyte_reabsorption_mechanisms | Water and Electrolyte Reabsorption Mechanisms]]

#### Loop of Henle
The filtrate then enters the loop of Henle, which is a long, U-shaped segment that extends deep into the renal medulla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. This loop has two main parts:
*   **Ascending Limb**: This part actively pumps out salts (sodium, potassium, chloride ions) into the surrounding renal medulla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. This process makes the medulla hypertonic, or very salty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. The ascending limb is impermeable to water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.
*   **Descending Limb**: This part is permeable only to water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. As the filtrate moves down into the salty medulla, water naturally flows out of the descending limb via osmosis, due to the high solute concentration in the medulla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. This is a major mechanism for reabsorbing large amounts of water back into the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. The length of the loop allows ample time for water secretion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.

#### Distal Convoluted Tubule
After the loop of Henle, the filtrate enters the distal convoluted tubule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. Here, more reabsorption occurs, including calcium and additional sodium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. A small amount of water is also reabsorbed in this segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>. By this stage, the filtrate has been significantly processed, with much of the water, salts, glucose, and amino acids reabsorbed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>.

#### Collecting Ducts
The processed filtrate, now mainly waste products and excess water, is then emptied into collecting ducts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. Multiple [[structure_and_function_of_the_nephron | nephrons]] drain into these ducts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. The collecting duct extends back into the salty renal medulla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. The permeability of the collecting duct to water can be regulated by hormones, such as anti-diuretic hormone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. If the collecting duct becomes more porous, more water leaves the filtrate as it passes through the salty medulla, further concentrating the urine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.

The concentrated fluid, now called urine, leaves the kidney via the ureters and travels to the urinary bladder for eventual excretion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>.

[[introduction_to_derivatives | Derivatives]] mark a point where mathematics becomes significantly more engaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. While the term "derivative" may sound complicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, its core concept is built upon understanding the slope.

## Slope of a Straight Line

For a straight line, the slope is constant throughout the entire line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. It is conventionally defined as the change in 'y' divided by the change in 'x' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This can also be expressed as "delta y" (Δy) divided by "delta x" (Δx) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. To find the slope at any point on a straight line, one would typically select two arbitrary points, calculate the change in their y-coordinates (Δy), and divide it by the change in their x-coordinates (Δx) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## The Challenge with Curves

Unlike straight lines, the slope of a curve is not constant; it continually changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. For example, a curve like y = x² starts almost flat and progressively becomes steeper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. Therefore, there isn't a single slope for the entire curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. The objective then becomes finding the slope at a *specific point* along the curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

## Concept of the Tangent Line

The slope of a curve at a given point is equivalent to the [[calculating_the_derivative_as_the_slope_of_tangent_line | slope of a tangent line]] to that point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. A tangent line touches the curve at exactly one point, and at that precise point, the curve and the tangent line share the same slope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

## From Secant Line to Tangent Line using Limits

To determine the slope at a specific point on a curve (e.g., at x = 'a' where the y-coordinate is [[definition_of_a_function | f of a]]), one can start by approximating it using a secant line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. A secant line connects two points on the curve: the point of interest ('a', [[definition_of_a_function | f of a]]) and another point close to it (a + h, [[definition_of_a_function | f of a + h]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. The 'h' represents the horizontal distance between these two points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

The slope of this secant line is calculated using the standard slope formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>:
$$ \frac{\text{Change in y}}{\text{Change in x}} = \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{(a+h) - a} = \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} $$
This secant line slope provides an approximation of the curve's slope at 'a' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. The accuracy of this approximation improves as 'h' becomes smaller, bringing the second point closer to the first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

To find the exact, instantaneous slope at point 'a', one must determine what happens as 'h' approaches zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. This is where the [[the_concept_of_a_limit_in_finding_derivatives | limit]] concept becomes essential and useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

## Definition of the Derivative

The [[derivatives_and_calculus_terminology | derivative]] is formally defined as the [[the_concept_of_a_limit_in_finding_derivatives | limit]] of the secant line's slope as 'h' approaches 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>:

>[!definition] The Derivative
>The derivative of a [[definition_of_a_function | function]] f(x) at a point 'a', denoted as f'(a), is given by:
>$$ f'(a) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} $$
>As 'h' approaches 0, the secant line's slope converges to the [[calculating_the_derivative_as_the_slope_of_tangent_line | slope of the tangent line]], which represents the exact, instantaneous slope of the curve at that point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

## Significance of the Derivative

The derivative is fundamentally the slope of a curve at an exact point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This concept is incredibly useful because it allows for the calculation of the slope of nearly any continuous curve at any specific point, a capability previously limited to straight lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

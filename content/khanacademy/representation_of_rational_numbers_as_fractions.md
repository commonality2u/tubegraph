A rational number is defined as any number that can be represented as the ratio of two integers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This means a rational number can always be written as a fraction $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are integers, and $q \neq 0$.

## Integers as Rational Numbers
Any integer can be represented as a rational number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. For example:
*   The number 1 can be represented as $\frac{1}{1}$, $\frac{-2}{-2}$, or $\frac{10,000}{10,000}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. These are all different representations of the number 1 as a ratio of two integers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   The number -7 can be represented as $\frac{-7}{1}$, $\frac{7}{-1}$, or $\frac{-14}{2}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Therefore, -7 is a rational number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

An infinite number of representations exist for any given rational number simply by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the same non-zero integer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Decimals as Rational Numbers
Numbers that are not integers can also be represented as fractions.

### Terminating Decimals
Terminating decimals can be converted into fractions. For instance:
*   The decimal 3.75 can be rewritten as $\frac{375}{100}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This fraction can be further represented as $\frac{750}{200}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   Alternatively, 3.75 is equivalent to the mixed number $3 \frac{3}{4}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. This mixed number can be converted to the improper fraction $\frac{15}{4}$ ($4 \times 3 + 3 = 15$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
These examples demonstrate that 3.75 is a rational number because it can be represented as the ratio of two integers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

### [[repeating_decimals_as_rational_numbers | Repeating Decimals]]
[[repeating_decimals_as_rational_numbers | Repeating decimals]] are also rational numbers. Any [[repeating_decimals_as_rational_numbers | repeating decimal]] can be converted into the ratio of two integers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
*   0.333... (or 0.$\bar{3}$) is equivalent to $\frac{1}{3}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   0.666... (or 0.$\bar{6}$) is equivalent to $\frac{2}{3}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

Even if a [[repeating_decimals_as_rational_numbers | repeating decimal]] has many digits before the pattern repeats, or a long repeating pattern, as long as the pattern repeats indefinitely, it can always be represented as the ratio of two integers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Contrast with [[introduction_to_irrational_numbers | Irrational Numbers]]
In contrast to rational numbers, [[introduction_to_irrational_numbers | irrational numbers]] cannot be represented as the ratio of two integers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. These numbers include famous mathematical constants such as Pi ($\pi$), Euler's number ($e$), the square root of 2 ($\sqrt{2}$), and the golden ratio ($\Phi$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. They are characterized by their decimal representations, which never terminate and never repeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

Converting a decimal into a fraction is often considered a straightforward process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

## General Method

To convert a decimal to a fraction, express the decimal number as a fraction over a power of 10, where the power of 10 corresponds to the decimal place value of the last digit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

### Example: Converting 0.035 to a fraction

To convert 0.035 into a fraction:
1.  Identify the place value of the last digit. In 0.035, the '5' is in the thousandths place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
2.  Write the non-zero digits of the decimal as the numerator (35) and the corresponding place value (1,000 for thousandths) as the denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
    *   So, 0.035 becomes 35/1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
3.  [[Simplifying fractions|Simplify]] the fraction to its simplest form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
    *   Both the numerator and denominator can be divided by 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
    *   35 รท 5 = 7
    *   1,000 รท 5 = 200
    *   Therefore, 0.035 simplified is 7/200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

### Example: Converting 0.030 to a fraction

When dealing with trailing zeros in decimals:
1.  Consider 0.030. Since the last significant digit is in the thousandths place, it can be written as 30/1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
2.  Alternatively, a trailing zero after the last non-zero digit in a decimal does not add value, so 0.030 is the same as 0.03 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
3.  For 0.03, the last digit is in the hundredths place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
4.  This means 0.03 can be written as 3/100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
5.  Both 30/1,000 and 3/100 are equivalent; dividing both the numerator and denominator of 30/1,000 by 10 results in 3/100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

### Verification Exercise
To confirm the conversion, you can [[converting_fractions_to_decimals|convert the resulting fraction back into a decimal]] using the division method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. For instance, dividing 7 by 200 should yield 0.035 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

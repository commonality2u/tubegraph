DNA contains the genetic information that defines an organism, but this information must be expressed to be useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. The process of expressing the information in [[DNA structure and replication | DNA]] involves two main steps: [[gene_expression_and_transcription | transcription]] and translation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

## From DNA to Protein

The way information from a section of [[DNA structure and replication | DNA]] is expressed as a protein is through the related molecule [[role_of_rna_in_genetic_processes | RNA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. [[role_of_rna_in_genetic_processes | RNA]] stands for ribonucleic acid, distinct from [[DNA structure and replication | DNA]] (deoxyribonucleic acid) primarily by its sugar backbone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

In eukaryotic cells, [[DNA and cell function | DNA]] resides within the nucleus, but its information largely needs to exit the nucleus to be expressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. [[role_of_rna_in_genetic_processes | RNA]] acts as a messenger, specifically [[messenger_rna_and_transcription_process | messenger RNA]] (mRNA), to carry genetic information from a particular [[gene_expression_and_transcription | gene]] section of [[DNA structure and replication | DNA]] out of the nucleus for translation into a protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

The process of creating [[messenger_rna_and_transcription_process | mRNA]] from a [[DNA structure and replication | DNA]] template is called [[gene_expression_and_transcription | transcription]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. During [[gene_expression_and_transcription | transcription]], a strand of [[messenger_rna_and_transcription_process | mRNA]] is constructed based on one half of the [[DNA structure and replication | DNA]] molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. A key difference in [[role_of_rna_in_genetic_processes | RNA]] compared to [[DNA structure and replication | DNA]] is that adenine (A) pairs with uracil (U) instead of thymine (T), while cytosine (C) and guanine (G) still pair with each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. Once transcribed, this single strand of [[messenger_rna_and_transcription_process | mRNA]] contains the genetic information to be expressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

## Translation: Building Proteins from mRNA

After [[gene_expression_and_transcription | transcription]], the [[messenger_rna_and_transcription_process | mRNA]] leaves the nucleus and attaches to a [[protein_synthesis_and_ribosomes | ribosome]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. The process of converting the [[messenger_rna_and_transcription_process | mRNA]] sequence into a sequence of amino acids, which form proteins, is called **translation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

### Codons
The genetic code within [[messenger_rna_and_transcription_process | mRNA]] is read in sequences of three bases, known as **codons** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. Each codon specifies a particular amino acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. With four possible bases (A, U, C, G) at three positions, there are 4 x 4 x 4 = 64 possible codons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. Since there are only 20 common amino acids, the genetic code is redundant, meaning more than one codon can code for the same amino acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.

### Ribosomes and tRNA
[[protein_synthesis_and_ribosomes | Ribosomes]] facilitate the process of translation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Another type of [[role_of_rna_in_genetic_processes | RNA]], called **transfer RNA** (tRNA), plays a crucial role in bringing the correct amino acids to the [[ribosome_structure_and_function | ribosome]] according to the [[messenger_rna_and_transcription_process | mRNA]] sequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. Each tRNA molecule has an anticodon that is complementary to an [[messenger_rna_and_transcription_process | mRNA]] codon and carries a specific amino acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

As the [[ribosome_structure_and_function | ribosome]] moves along the [[messenger_rna_and_transcription_process | mRNA]], tRNAs deliver their amino acids, which are then linked together in a specific sequence to form a polypeptide chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

## Proteins: The Workhorses of Life
The resulting polypeptide chain folds into a three-dimensional structure, forming a **protein** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. Proteins are fundamental molecules that perform most of the work in cells and are essential for the structure, function, and regulation of the body's tissues and organs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. They act as enzymes, structural components (like muscle), transport molecules, and more, effectively "doing the work of life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. Proteins can range from dozens to thousands of amino acids in length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.

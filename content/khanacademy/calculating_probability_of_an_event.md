[[basic_probability_concepts | Probability]] is a measure of the likelihood that something will occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. When [[calculating_standard_deviation_and_probability | calculating probability]], one considers the number of outcomes that satisfy a specific event compared to the total number of possible outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Key Concepts

*   **Event in Question**: The specific outcome or set of outcomes that one is interested in determining the likelihood of (e.g., picking a yellow marble) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   **Trial**: The action or experiment being performed (e.g., picking a marble out of a bag) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   **Possible Outcomes / Sample Space**: The set of all possible results that can occur from a trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This is sometimes referred to as the "sample space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. The size of the sample space is the total number of possible outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Formula

The [[basic_probability_concepts | probability]] of an event (P) is generally calculated as:

$$
P(\text{Event}) = \frac{\text{Number of outcomes that satisfy the event}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}}
$$
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>

## Example: [[understanding_probability_through_marbles_example | Understanding Probability Through Marbles Example]]

Consider a bag containing different colored marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>:
*   3 yellow marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>
*   2 red marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>
*   2 green marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>
*   1 blue marble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>

### Determining Possible Outcomes

The total number of possible outcomes when picking one marble from the bag is the sum of all marbles:
3 (yellow) + 2 (red) + 2 (green) + 1 (blue) = 8 possible outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This represents the size of the sample space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

### Determining Outcomes Satisfying the Event

If the event in question is "picking a yellow marble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, the number of outcomes that satisfy this event is the number of yellow marbles, which is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

### Calculating the Probability

Using the formula, the [[basic_probability_concepts | probability]] of picking a yellow marble is:

$$
P(\text{Yellow}) = \frac{\text{Number of yellow marbles}}{\text{Total number of marbles}} = \frac{3}{8}
$$
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

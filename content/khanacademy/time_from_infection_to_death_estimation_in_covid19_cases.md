Estimating the actual number of new COVID-19 cases in an area can be done by analyzing the number of deaths, the estimated [[factors_influencing_covid19_mortality_rates | mortality rate]], the time from infection to death, and the virus's spread rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This approach is based on analysis by Thomas Pueyo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Components of Estimation

To estimate the time from infection to death, two main periods are considered:

### 1. Incubation Period (Infection to Symptoms)
The incubation period is the estimated time from when a person gets infected to when they start to show symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Current estimates suggest this period is approximately **five days** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

### 2. Time from Symptoms to Death
For the cases that unfortunately result in death, the estimated time from the onset of symptoms to death varies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. For calculation purposes, an estimate of approximately **15 days** from showing symptoms to death can be used to simplify the numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

### Total Time from Infection to Death
Combining these two periods, the total estimated time from infection to death is approximately **20 days** (5 days incubation + 15 days from symptoms to death) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. This 20-day period applies to the estimated one percent of cases that result in death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

## Application in Estimating Actual Cases

The 20-day lag between infection and death is crucial for [[estimating_actual_covid19_cases_from_deaths | estimating actual COVID-19 cases]] from reported deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

For example:
If one death is reported today in a region, it's likely that the person contracted the virus approximately 20 days ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

Considering a 1% [[factors_influencing_covid19_mortality_rates | mortality rate]], this single death implies that approximately **100 people** were infected on the day the deceased person contracted the virus (20 days prior) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

If the infection rate in the population is assumed to double every five days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>, the current number of cases can be projected:
*   **20 days ago:** 100 infected cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>
*   **15 days ago:** 200 cases (doubled from 100) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>
*   **10 days ago:** 400 cases (doubled from 200) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>
*   **5 days ago:** 800 cases (doubled from 400) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>
*   **Today:** Approximately 1600 cases (doubled from 800) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>

This demonstrates that the actual number of infected persons is likely significantly higher than reported figures, especially in areas with limited testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Reported cases often lag behind the actual situation due to the delay between infection, symptom onset, and testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> The estimated time from infection to death (20 days) and the assumed [[factors_influencing_covid19_mortality_rates | mortality rate]] (1%) are crucial for [[estimating_actual_covid19_cases_from_deaths | backward estimation]] of active cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. If the [[factors_influencing_covid19_mortality_rates | mortality rate]] were higher (e.g., 5%), fewer initial infections would be inferred from a single death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. Conversely, a lower [[factors_influencing_covid19_mortality_rates | mortality rate]] (e.g., 0.5%) would suggest more initial infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. As the number of reported deaths increases, these backward estimations become more reliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

## Why Reported Cases Differ from Actual Cases
The reported number of cases is based on individuals who have been tested and received a positive result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. However, many people may not have severe enough symptoms to seek testing, or they might not have symptoms yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Therefore, the actual number of cases is likely much larger than the confirmed cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

In Hubei province, China, officials were able to estimate actual cases in hindsight by asking confirmed patients when their symptoms first appeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This revealed a significant discrepancy:
*   On January 23rd, 2020, there were roughly 300 confirmed new cases, but the actual new cases were close to 2,500 â€“ approximately eight times higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   Before Wuhan's shutdown on January 23rd, the cumulative actual cases were around 12,000, while confirmed cases were only about 444 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

This [[differences_between_reported_and_actual_covid19_cases | difference between reported and actual cases]] is often more pronounced in regions with less comprehensive testing, such as the United States in early March 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. The [[impact_of_testing_on_reported_covid19_case_numbers | extent of testing]] directly affects the accuracy of reported numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

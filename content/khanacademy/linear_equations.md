A [[understanding_linear_equations | linear equation]] can be represented in various ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For example, the equation `y = 2x + 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a> can be rearranged into an infinite number of equivalent forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. These rearrangements are possible through "logical algebraic operations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

Examples of equivalent forms for `y = 2x + 3`:
*   `-2x + y = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   `y - 5 = 2(x - 1)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>

## Slope-Intercept Form

One particularly useful representation of a [[understanding_linear_equations | linear equation]] is the **slope-intercept form** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This form explicitly solves for `y`, appearing as `y = mx + b` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

In this form:
*   The `m` coefficient represents the [[properties_of_slope_in_linear_equations | slope]] of the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   The `b` constant represents the y-intercept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

### Graphing from Slope-Intercept Form

The slope-intercept form makes [[graphing_equations | graphing equations]] straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

#### Example: `y = 2x + 3`

1.  **Find the Y-intercept:**
    *   The y-intercept occurs when `x = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
    *   Substitute `x = 0` into the equation: `y = 2(0) + 3 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
    *   This gives the point `(0, 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, which is the y-intercept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

2.  **Determine the Slope:**
    *   In `y = 2x + 3`, the coefficient of `x` is `2`. This is the [[properties_of_slope_in_linear_equations | slope]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
    *   The [[properties_of_slope_in_linear_equations | slope]] (`change in y / change in x`) is `2/1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. This means for every `+1` change in `x`, there is a `+2` change in `y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

    ```
    x | y = 2x + 3
    --|-----------
    0 | 3         (y-intercept)
    1 | 5         (increase x by 1, y increases by 2)
    2 | 7         (increase x by 1, y increases by 2)
    -1| 1         (decrease x by 1, y decreases by 2)
    ```
    *   Using the y-intercept `(0, 3)` and another point like `(1, 5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>, the line `y = 2x + 3` can be drawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

#### Example: `y = -x + 2`

*   **Y-intercept:** The y-intercept is `(0, 2)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   **Slope:** The coefficient of `x` is `-1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. This means for every `+1` change in `x`, there is a `-1` change in `y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
    *   If `x` increases by `2`, `y` will decrease by `2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

The slope-intercept form `y = mx + b` makes it very easy to identify both the y-intercept (the `b` value) and the [[properties_of_slope_in_linear_equations | slope]] (the `m` value) directly from the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

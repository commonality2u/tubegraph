[[solving_absolute_value_inequalities | Solving inequalities]] that contain absolute values is a topic that can often cause confusion in [[introduction_to_algebra | algebra]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. However, by understanding the fundamental meaning of absolute value, these problems can become intuitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Understanding Absolute Value
The absolute value of a number represents its distance from zero on a number line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Solving Absolute Value Inequalities

### Case 1: Absolute Value "Less Than" a Number
When an absolute value expression is "less than" a number, it implies that the value inside the absolute value must be *within* a certain distance from zero.

#### Example: `|x| < 12`
This inequality asks for all values of `x` that are less than 12 units away from 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   On a number line, this range extends from -12 to +12, not including the endpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   Any number between -12 and 12 will have an absolute value less than 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   For instance, the absolute value of -6 is 6, which is less than 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. The absolute value of -11 is 11, which is also less than 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   The solution set for `|x| < 12` is when `x` is greater than -12 AND `x` is less than 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   This can be written as a [[compound_inequalities_with_absolute_values | compound inequality]]: `-12 < x < 12` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   In interval notation, this is `(-12, 12)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

#### Example: `|5x + 3| < 7`
This inequality means that the expression `5x + 3` must be less than 7 units away from 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
*   This translates to: `5x + 3` must be less than 7 AND `5x + 3` must be greater than -7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   This creates a [[compound_inequalities_with_absolute_values | compound inequality]]: `-7 < 5x + 3 < 7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   To solve:
    *   Subtract 3 from all parts of the inequality: `-7 - 3 < 5x < 7 - 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>
    *   ` -10 < 5x < 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>
    *   Divide all parts by 5: `-10/5 < x < 4/5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>
    *   The solution is: `-2 < x < 4/5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>
*   In interval notation, this is `(-2, 4/5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

### Case 2: Absolute Value "Greater Than" a Number
When an absolute value expression is "greater than" a number, it implies that the value inside the absolute value must be *further away* than a certain distance from zero.

#### Example: `|7x| >= 21`
This inequality means that `7x` must be 21 or more units away from 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   On a number line, this means `7x` must be either greater than or equal to 21, or less than or equal to -21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   If `7x` is less than or equal to -21 (e.g., -30), its absolute value will be greater than 21 (e.g., 30) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
*   If `7x` is greater than or equal to 21, its absolute value will also be greater than 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   This leads to two separate inequalities connected by "OR":
    1.  `7x <= -21` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>
    2.  `7x >= 21` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>
*   To solve these:
    1.  Divide by 7: `x <= -3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>
    2.  Divide by 7: `x >= 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>
*   The solution set is `x <= -3` OR `x >= 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

#### Example: `|2x/7 + 9| > 5/7`
This means the expression `2x/7 + 9` must be more than 5/7 units away from 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
*   This leads to two separate inequalities:
    1.  `2x/7 + 9 > 5/7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>
    2.  `2x/7 + 9 < -5/7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>
*   To simplify, multiply all terms in both inequalities by 7 to clear the denominators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>:
    1.  `2x + 63 > 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>
    2.  `2x + 63 < -5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>
*   Solve each inequality:
    1.  Subtract 63: `2x > 5 - 63` -> `2x > -58` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>, then divide by 2: `x > -29` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>
    2.  Subtract 63: `2x < -5 - 63` -> `2x < -68` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>, then divide by 2: `x < -34` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>
*   The solution set is `x > -29` OR `x < -34` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.

## General Rules for Absolute Value Inequalities

While understanding the visualization on a number line is key to grasping absolute value inequalities, general rules can also be derived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

*   **Rule for "Less Than"**:
    If `|f(x)| < a` (where `a > 0`), then `f(x)` must be less than `a` units away from 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
    This translates to: `-a < f(x) < a` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
    This can be broken down into two conditions joined by "AND": `f(x) > -a` AND `f(x) < a` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

*   **Rule for "Greater Than"**:
    If `|f(x)| > a` (where `a > 0`), then `f(x)` must be further than `a` units away from 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.
    This translates to: `f(x) > a` OR `f(x) < -a` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
    If `f(x)` is less than `-a`, taking its absolute value will make it greater than `a` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

Understanding these concepts through visualization helps in solving complex [[compound_inequalities_with_absolute_values | compound inequalities with absolute values]] without needing to memorize rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

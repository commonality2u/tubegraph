The apple market, like any other market, is influenced by the forces of demand and supply, which dictate prices and quantities exchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Graphing Market Forces

To visualize these forces, a standard graph is used where the vertical axis represents the price per pound of apples, and the horizontal axis represents the quantity of apples in thousands of pounds for a specific period (e.g., the next week) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. For example, prices might range from $1 to $5 per pound, and quantities from 1,000 to 5,000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## [[Understanding demand curve | Demand Curve]]

The [[Understanding demand curve | demand curve]] illustrates the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity consumers are willing to buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   **Behavior**: If the price of apples is very high, consumers will [[Impact of price changes on quantity demanded | demand]] less. Conversely, if the price is low, they will [[Impact of price changes on quantity demanded | demand]] more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This relationship is consistent with the [[Law of demand | law of demand]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   **Example**: At $5 a pound, the [[Impact of price changes on quantity demanded | quantity demanded]] might be around 500 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. At $1 a pound, the [[Impact of price changes on quantity demanded | quantity demanded]] could jump to 4,000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   **[[Difference between demand and quantity demanded | Quantity Demanded]] vs. Demand**: It's crucial to differentiate between "demand" and "[[Difference between demand and quantity demanded | quantity demanded]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The [[Difference between demand and quantity demanded | quantity demanded]] refers to a specific amount at a specific price, while demand (or the [[Understanding demand curve | demand curve]]) represents the entire relationship across all possible prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## [[Understanding supply curve | Supply Curve]]

The [[Understanding supply curve | supply curve]] shows the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity producers are willing to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Behavior**: Producers are generally not willing to supply apples below a certain price (e.g., 50 cents) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. As the price increases, producers are incentivized to supply more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. For example, at $1, suppliers might be willing to supply about 1,000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## Market Scenarios: [[Shortages and surpluses in markets | Shortage]]

A [[Shortages and surpluses in markets | shortage]] occurs when the [[Difference between demand and quantity demanded | quantity demanded]] exceeds the quantity supplied at a given price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

### Example: Price of $1 per Pound
*   If suppliers set the price at $1 per pound, the [[Impact of price changes on quantity demanded | quantity supplied]] would be 1,000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   However, at this price, the [[Impact of price changes on quantity demanded | quantity demanded]] is 4,000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   This creates a [[Shortages and surpluses in markets | shortage]] of 3,000 pounds of apples (4,000 demanded - 1,000 supplied) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

### Market Adjustment to a Shortage
In a [[Shortages and surpluses in markets | shortage]] situation:
*   Consumers will bid up prices because there aren't enough apples to meet demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   As prices increase, producers are encouraged to supply more apples, moving up their [[Understanding supply curve | supply curve]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   Concurrently, as prices increase, consumers will demand less, moving along the [[Understanding demand curve | demand curve]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   This process continues until the [[Shortages and surpluses in markets | shortage]] is alleviated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

## Market Scenarios: [[Shortages and surpluses in markets | Surplus]]

A [[Shortages and surpluses in markets | surplus]] occurs when the quantity supplied exceeds the [[Difference between demand and quantity demanded | quantity demanded]] at a given price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

### Example: Price of $3 per Pound
*   If suppliers set the price at $3 per pound, they might plan to produce 3,000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   However, at this higher price, the [[Impact of price changes on quantity demanded | quantity demanded]] by consumers might only be about 1,300 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
*   This results in a [[Shortages and surpluses in markets | surplus]] of 1,700 pounds of apples (3,000 supplied - 1,300 demanded) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

### Market Adjustment to a Surplus
In a [[Shortages and surpluses in markets | surplus]] situation:
*   Producers, with unsold and potentially spoiling apples, will start reducing prices to attract buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   As prices decrease, producers will also reduce the quantity they supply, moving down their [[Understanding supply curve | supply curve]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   Simultaneously, as prices decrease, consumers will [[Impact of price changes on quantity demanded | demand]] more apples, moving along their [[Understanding demand curve | demand curve]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   This process continues until the [[Shortages and surpluses in markets | surplus]] is eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

## [[Market equilibrium and equilibrium price | Market Equilibrium]]

Both scenarios (shortage and surplus) naturally push the market towards a point where the [[Understanding supply curve | supply]] and [[Understanding demand curve | demand]] curves intersect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

<p>This intersection point represents the <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>**[[Market equilibrium and equilibrium price | Equilibrium price]]**: The price at which the [[Understanding supply curve | quantity supplied]] equals the [[Understanding demand curve | quantity demanded]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. For the apple market example, this is approximately $2.15 per pound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.</li>
<li>**[[Market equilibrium and equilibrium price | Equilibrium quantity]]**: The quantity at which the [[Understanding supply curve | quantity supplied]] equals the [[Understanding demand curve | quantity demanded]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. In this example, it's about 2,200 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.</li>
</ul>
</div>

At [[Market equilibrium and equilibrium price | equilibrium]], all apples produced are sold, and none go bad, making it an ideal scenario for both consumers and producers, assuming no other changes occur in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

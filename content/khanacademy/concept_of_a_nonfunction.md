A nonfunction is a relationship where a given input produces more than one possible output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>. This contrasts with the [[definition_of_a_function | definition of a function]], which states that for every input, there must be only one output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>.

## Identifying a Nonfunction

### Visual Representation
A common way to identify a nonfunction is through its [[graphical_representation_and_visual_understanding_of_functions | visual representation]] on a coordinate plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.

Consider a circle centered at the origin with a radius of 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>.
*   The equation for this circle is `x² + y² = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>.
*   Visually, if you select a specific input value for 'x' (e.g., x=1), there are two corresponding 'y' values (outputs) on the circle: one positive and one negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>.

### Algebraic Example
To demonstrate why the relationship `x² + y² = 4` is not a function, we can solve for 'y' given an input 'x':

1.  Let's input `x = 1` into the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>.
    `1² + y² = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>
    `1 + y² = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>
2.  Subtract 1 from both sides:
    `y² = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>
3.  Solve for 'y':
    `y = ±√3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>

For the single input `x = 1`, there are two distinct outputs: positive square root of 3 (`√3`) and negative square root of 3 (`-√3`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>. Because an input of 1 yields two different outputs, this relationship is not considered a function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>. A [[definition_of_a_function | function]] can only have one output for a given input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>.

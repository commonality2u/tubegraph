Galileo Galilei, considered one of history's greatest minds, held a profound view on the role of mathematics in understanding the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. His perspective highlights the fundamental importance of mathematics as the language of the cosmos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## The Language of the Universe

Galileo famously stated:
> "Philosophy is written in that great book which ever lies before our eyes-- I mean the universe-- but we cannot understand it if we do not first learn the language and grasp the symbols in which is written. This book is written in the mathematical language, without which one wanders in vain through a dark labyrinth." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>

This quote underscores that mathematics is the essential language needed to comprehend the universe's structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The speaker emphasizes that this dramatic yet deep statement reveals the core purpose of mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Mathematics as Abstraction

As one delves deeper into [[introduction_to_algebra | algebra]], the process involves abstracting concepts to reveal core ideas that explain how the universe is structured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. These fundamental mathematical ideas are pure and more fundamental than any specific application, whether in economics, finance, physics, or chemistry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

The power of mathematics, particularly [[introduction_to_algebra | algebra]], lies in its ability to focus on and manipulate these abstractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Discoveries made through manipulating abstract mathematical ideas can then be reapplied to an infinite number of real-world applications, such as economics, finance, computer science, logic, electrical engineering, or accounting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

### Revealing Universal Structure
Mathematics, by allowing the stripping away of human definitions and applications, reveals the "true structure of the universe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. This focus on abstraction allows the discovery of fundamental truths about the universe, which then have implications across countless ideas and domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

## Mathematics as a Universal Language

Galileo's perspective helps explain why mathematics is often considered the first common ground for communication, even with an alien life form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. It serves as a universal language through which understanding can begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

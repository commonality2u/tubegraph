From: [[khanacademy]] <br/> 

Galileo Galilei, described as one of the greatest minds in human history, offered a profound perspective on the nature and purpose of mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. His insights encapsulate the true point of [[introduction_to_algebra_and_its_importance | algebra]] and [[introduction_to_algebra_and_its_importance | mathematics]] generally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## The Universe as a Mathematical Book

Galileo famously stated:
> "Philosophy is written in that great book which ever lies before our eyes--I mean the universe--but we cannot understand it if we do not first learn the language and grasp the symbols in which is written. This book is written in the [[mathematics_as_a_universal_language | mathematical language]], without which one wanders in vain through a dark labyrinth." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>

This dramatic and deep quote highlights mathematics as the fundamental language through which the universe's structure can be understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Mathematics as Abstraction and Universal Application

According to this view, as one delves deeper into [[introduction_to_algebra_and_its_importance | algebra]], the process involves abstracting concepts to grasp core ideas that explain the universe's structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. These abstract mathematical ideas, while applicable to fields like [[role_of_mathematics_and_assumptions_in_economics | economics]], finance, physics, and chemistry, are considered more fundamental and pure than any single application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

The power of mathematics lies in its ability to focus on abstract principles and manipulate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Discoveries made through these manipulations can then be universally reapplied across diverse domains such as [[role_of_mathematics_and_assumptions_in_economics | economics]], finance, computer science, logic, and electrical engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. This implies that mathematics reveals the true structure of the universe by stripping away human-defined applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

The universality of mathematical principles suggests that new applications will continue to be discovered in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. This perspective underscores why [[mathematics_as_a_universal_language | mathematics]] is often considered the first common ground for communication, even with alien life forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

When faced with a real-world scenario presented as a word problem, the first step towards solving it algebraically is to [[interpreting_and_creating_equations_from_word_problems | translate the information into mathematical equations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. This process involves defining variables and then constructing equations based on the relationships described in the problem.

## Steps for Translation

1.  **Define Variables**: Assign variables (e.g., `x` and `y`) to represent the unknown quantities that the problem asks you to find <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
    *   For example, if a problem asks for the cost of a candy bar and a Fruit Roll-Up, you might define:
        *   `x` = cost of a candy bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>
        *   `y` = cost of a Fruit Roll-Up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>

2.  **Formulate Equations from Statements**: Break down the word problem into individual statements or pieces of information, and convert each into an algebraic equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

    *   **Example Scenario**: Nadia and Peter visit a candy store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

        *   **Nadia's Purchase**: "Nadia buys 3 candy bars and 4 Fruit Roll-Ups for $2.84" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
            *   Cost of 3 candy bars: `3x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>
            *   Cost of 4 Fruit Roll-Ups: `4y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>
            *   Total cost: `2.84` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>
            *   **Equation 1**: `3x + 4y = 2.84` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>

        *   **Peter's Purchase**: "Peter also buys 3 candy bars, but can only afford 1 additional Fruit Roll-Up. His purchase costs $1.79" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
            *   Cost of 3 candy bars: `3x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>
            *   Cost of 1 Fruit Roll-Up: `1y` (or just `y`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>
            *   Total cost: `1.79` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>
            *   **Equation 2**: `3x + y = 1.79` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>

Once translated, these [[understanding_systems_of_equations | systems of equations]] can be solved using various [[algebraic_techniques_for_solving_equations | algebraic techniques]], such as substitution or elimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

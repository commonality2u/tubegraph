After the processes of glycolysis and the Krebs cycle, the cell is left with 10 NADH and 2 FADH2 molecules, which are located in the matrix of the mitochondria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These molecules are crucial for generating ATP in the [[electron_transport_chain_and_atp_production | electron transport chain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## The Electron Transport Chain (ETC)
The [[electron_transport_chain_and_atp_production | electron transport chain]] is a complex process, and while much of its mechanism is well-established, some intricate details, such as the exact workings of certain proteins, remain areas of current research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### ATP Yield from NADH and FADH2
Each NADH molecule is indirectly responsible for producing approximately three ATP molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Similarly, each FADH2 molecule indirectly yields about two ATPs in an efficient cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. The difference in ATP yield is due to the electrons from FADH2 being at a slightly lower energy state when they enter the [[electron_transport_chain_and_atp_production | electron transport chain]] compared to those from NADH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Initial and Final Steps of the ETC
The overall process involves the [[oxidation_and_reduction_processes_in_the_electron_transport_chain | oxidation]] of NADH and the [[oxidation_and_reduction_processes_in_the_electron_transport_chain | reduction]] of oxygen.

1.  **Oxidation of NADH**: NADH is oxidized, meaning it loses electrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This half-reaction produces NAD+, a proton (H+), and two electrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. The NAD+ can then be reused in the Krebs cycle and [[reduction_of_nad_to_nadh_in_glycolysis | glycolysis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This is considered the first step of the [[electron_transport_chain_and_atp_production | electron transport chain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
2.  **Reduction of Oxygen**: At the end of the [[electron_transport_chain_and_atp_production | electron transport chain]], the two electrons, along with two hydrogen protons and one oxygen atom (from half a molecular oxygen), combine to produce water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. This process is the [[oxidation_and_reduction_processes_in_the_electron_transport_chain | reduction]] of oxygen to water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

### Energy Release and Proton Pumping
The electrons released from NADH start at a very high energy state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. As they are transported through a series of transition molecules (like coenzyme Q and cytochrome C) in the [[electron_transport_chain_and_atp_production | electron transport chain]], they progressively move to slightly lower energy states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Each step where an electron moves from a higher to a lower energy state releases energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

This released energy is utilized by large protein complexes embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane (cristae) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. These proteins actively pump hydrogen protons from the mitochondrial matrix into the outer compartment (intermembrane space) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. This creates a concentration gradient where the outer compartment has a significantly higher concentration of hydrogen protons (making it more acidic and positively charged) than the matrix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

### ATP Synthesis via ATP Synthase
The buildup of hydrogen protons in the outer compartment creates a strong electrochemical gradient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. These protons naturally want to flow back into the matrix to equalize the concentration and charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. However, the cristae are impermeable to them, so they must pass through a specialized protein called [[atp_synthase_function_and_mechanism | ATP synthase]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

As hydrogen protons flow through [[atp_synthase_function_and_mechanism | ATP synthase]], they cause an internal axle-like structure within the protein to spin, similar to a turbine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. This mechanical spinning action induces conformational changes in the [[atp_synthase_function_and_mechanism | ATP synthase]] protein, which in turn squeezes adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and an inorganic phosphate (P_i) together to form [[role_of_atp_and_nadph_in_photosynthesis | ATP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. This process occurs simultaneously at multiple sites on the [[atp_synthase_function_and_mechanism | ATP synthase]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

### Total ATP Yield in Cellular Respiration
The entire sequence of events — from the [[oxidation_and_reduction_processes_in_the_electron_transport_chain | oxidation]] of NADH and FADH2, to the pumping of protons, and finally to the flow of protons through [[atp_synthase_function_and_mechanism | ATP synthase]] — leads to the bulk of ATP production during cellular respiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.

Under ideal conditions:
*   The 10 NADH molecules (from [[atp_production_and_consumption_in_glycolysis | glycolysis]] and the Krebs cycle) generate approximately 30 ATPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>.
*   The 2 FADH2 molecules (from the Krebs cycle) generate 4 ATPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.

Adding the 2 net ATPs directly produced in [[atp_production_and_consumption_in_glycolysis | glycolysis]] and the 2 ATPs directly produced in the Krebs cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>, the total theoretical yield from one molecule of glucose is approximately 38 ATPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>. It's important to note that this is an ideal number, and actual [[energy_efficiency_and_atp_yield_of_cellular_respiration | ATP yield]] can vary due to factors like proton leaks or energy loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

[[overview_of_meiosis | Meiosis]] is the process that produces gametes, which are specialized sex cells essential for [[role_of_meiosis_in_sexual_reproduction | sexual reproduction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09"></a>. Unlike [[overview_of_mitosis_and_meiosis | mitosis]], which is a continuous cycle for cell growth and repair in somatic cells, meiosis is not a cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02"></a>. Its primary outcome is the creation of cells for fertilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34"></a>.

## Production of Gametes through Meiosis

The process of [[overview_of_meiosis | meiosis]] begins with a germ cell, which is a specialized cell that has a diploid number of chromosomes (2n) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00"></a>. For humans, this means 46 chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22"></a>. Germ cells can also undergo [[overview_of_mitosis_and_meiosis | mitosis]] to produce more diploid germ cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32"></a>.

Meiosis occurs in two main phases:

1.  **Meiosis One** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12"></a>:
    *   The initial diploid cell undergoes DNA replication during interphase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09"></a>.
    *   This phase results in two cells, each containing a haploid number of chromosomes (n) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15"></a>. For humans, these cells would have 23 chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34"></a>.
    *   During Meiosis One, homologous pairs of chromosomes are split <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29"></a>. This splitting means that the resulting cells may not have identical [[genetic_variation_through_meiotic_processes | genetic information]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11"></a>.

2.  **Meiosis Two** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48"></a>:
    *   Each of the two haploid cells from Meiosis One then undergoes a second division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45"></a>.
    *   This phase is similar to [[differences_between_mitosis_and_meiosis | mitosis]], but it starts with haploid cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55"></a>.
    *   The outcome of Meiosis Two is four cells, each with a haploid number of chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01"></a>. These four cells are the gametes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05"></a>.

## Location of Gamete Production

Gametes are produced in specific reproductive organs:
*   **Males**: In human males, meiosis occurs in the testes, producing sperm cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14"></a>.
*   **Females**: In human females, meiosis occurs in the ovaries, producing egg cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22"></a>.
*   **Plants**: For organisms like trees, this process yields pollen or ovules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28"></a>.

## Role in Fertilization

The haploid gametes (sperm or egg cells) are specifically designed for fertilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12"></a>. In [[role_of_meiosis_in_sexual_reproduction | sexual reproduction]], two gametes, typically from different organisms, fuse together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37"></a>. This fusion results in a fertilized egg, which then contains a full diploid set of chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39"></a>. This fertilized egg can then undergo [[overview_of_mitosis_and_meiosis | mitosis]] to develop into an entirely new organism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44"></a>.

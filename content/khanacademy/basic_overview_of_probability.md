This article provides a basic overview of [[basic_probability_concepts|probability]], a concept used to describe the chances of fundamentally random events occurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. It helps in understanding and quantifying the likelihood of outcomes for events that are uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

## Calculating Probability

One common way to calculate the [[calculating_probability_of_an_event|probability of an event]], often found in textbooks, is by using a ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>:

> P(Event) = (Number of equally likely possibilities that meet the conditions) / (Total number of equally likely possibilities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>

## Conceptualizing Probability Through Experimentation

Another way to understand [[basic_concepts_in_probability_and_statistics|probability]] involves considering what percentage of trials would result in a desired outcome if an experiment were run many, many times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. The more times the experiment is performed (e.g., thousands, millions, or even an infinite number of times), the closer the observed percentage of the desired outcome will get to its theoretical probability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.

## Examples of Probability

### Flipping a Fair Coin

When discussing a [[concept_of_a_fair_coin_and_calculating_probability|fair coin]], it means the coin has an equal chance of landing on either side, with both sides having the same weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

*   **Possibilities:** For a single flip, there are two equally likely possibilities: heads or tails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.
*   **Probability of Heads:** The [[calculating_probability_of_an_event|probability of getting heads]] is 1 out of 2, or 1/2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. This can also be expressed as 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Outcome:** If a fair coin is flipped many times, approximately 50% of the flips will result in heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. Even with a million flips, while a small chance of all tails exists, the trend will be towards 50% heads as the number of trials increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>.
    *   **Experiment:** Shaking 100-200 coins in a box simultaneously and counting heads will demonstrate results very close to 50% as the number of coins increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.

### Rolling a Fair Die

A fair die has six equally likely possibilities when rolled: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.

*   **Probability of Rolling a 1:**
    *   Total equally likely possibilities: 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>.
    *   Possibilities meeting the condition (rolling a 1): 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>.
    *   P(1) = 1/6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.

*   **Probability of Rolling a 1 or a 6:**
    *   Total equally likely possibilities: 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>.
    *   Possibilities meeting the condition (rolling a 1 or a 6): 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>.
    *   P(1 or 6) = 2/6 = 1/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>.

*   **Probability of Rolling a 2 and a 3 (on one roll):**
    *   This is an impossible event on a single roll of a die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>.
    *   Getting a 2 and getting a 3 are [[probability_terminology_explained|mutually exclusive events]]; they cannot happen at the same time in one trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>.
    *   P(2 and 3) = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>.

*   **Probability of Rolling an Even Number:**
    *   Total equally likely possibilities: 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>.
    *   Possibilities meeting the condition (being an even number): 2, 4, 6 (3 possibilities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>.
    *   P(Even Number) = 3/6 = 1/2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>.

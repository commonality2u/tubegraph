[[Completing the square technique]] is a method used to [[solving_quadratic_equations | solve quadratic equations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This technique is versatile, working for any [[solving_quadratic_equations | quadratic equation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, and serves as the foundation for the [[introduction_to_the_quadratic_formula | quadratic formula]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The quadratic formula itself can be proven using [[completing the square technique | completing the square]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Core Concept: Building on Perfect Squares

The essence of [[completing the square technique | completing the square]] is to transform a [[solving_quadratic_equations | quadratic equation]] into a [[recognizing_perfect_squares | perfect square]] expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This involves strategically adding and subtracting values from both sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. The process builds upon the concept of [[perfect square identification | solving quadratics using perfect squares]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

A [[recognizing_perfect_squares | perfect square]] in the form `(x - a)²` expands to `x² - 2ax + a²` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. To make a quadratic expression like `x² + bx` a [[recognizing_perfect_squares | perfect square]], one needs to add `(b/2)²` to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This constant `(b/2)²` ensures the expression can be factored into `(x + b/2)²` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

## Example 1: `x² - 4x = 5`

1.  **Identify the target form**: To make `x² - 4x` a [[recognizing_perfect_squares | perfect square]], it needs a constant term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
2.  **Determine the constant to add**:
    *   Take the coefficient of the x-term, which is -4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
    *   Find half of this coefficient: -4 / 2 = -2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
    *   Square the result: (-2)² = 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
3.  **Add the constant to both sides**: Add 4 to both sides of the equation `x² - 4x = 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, resulting in `x² - 4x + 4 = 5 + 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, or `x² - 4x + 4 = 9` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
4.  **Factor the perfect square**: The left side becomes `(x - 2)²` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. So, `(x - 2)² = 9` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
5.  **Solve using square roots**:
    *   Take the square root of both sides: `x - 2 = ±√9` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, so `x - 2 = ±3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
    *   Add 2 to both sides: `x = 2 ± 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
    *   This yields two solutions: `x = 2 + 3 = 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a> or `x = 2 - 3 = -1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

While this specific problem could also be solved by [[factoring quadratic equations | factoring]] `x² - 4x - 5 = 0` into `(x - 5)(x + 1) = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>, [[completing the square technique | completing the square]] is a more universally applicable [[methods for solving quadratic equations | method]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

## Example 2: `10x² - 30x - 8 = 0` (A More Complex Case)

1.  **Simplify the equation**: Divide the entire equation by the leading coefficient.
    *   First, divide by 2: `5x² - 15x - 4 = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
    *   Then, divide by 5 to make the leading coefficient 1: `x² - 3x - 4/5 = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
    *   This form is difficult to solve by [[factoring quadratic equations | factoring]] due to the fraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
2.  **Isolate the x-terms**: Move the constant term to the right side of the equation by adding 4/5 to both sides: `x² - 3x = 4/5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
3.  **Determine the constant to add**:
    *   Take half of the x-coefficient: -3 / 2 = -3/2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
    *   Square the result: (-3/2)² = 9/4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
4.  **Add the constant to both sides**: Add 9/4 to both sides: `x² - 3x + 9/4 = 4/5 + 9/4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
5.  **Find a common denominator for the right side**: Convert 4/5 to 16/20 and 9/4 to 45/20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.
6.  **Simplify the right side**: `16/20 + 45/20 = 61/20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
    *   The equation becomes `x² - 3x + 9/4 = 61/20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
7.  **Factor the perfect square**: The left side becomes `(x - 3/2)²` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. So, `(x - 3/2)² = 61/20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
8.  **Solve using square roots**:
    *   Take the square root of both sides: `x - 3/2 = ±√(61/20)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
    *   Add 3/2 to both sides: `x = 3/2 ± √(61/20)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
    *   Approximate solutions are `x ≈ 3.246` and `x ≈ -0.246` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. These values can be verified by plugging them back into the original equation, yielding results very close to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

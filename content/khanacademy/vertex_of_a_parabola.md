From: [[khanacademy]] <br/> 

A [[understanding_parabolas_in_algebra | parabola]], which is the graphical representation of a [[quadratic_polynomials | quadratic function]], has a characteristic U-shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The **vertex** is the critical point on the parabola that marks its turning point. It is either the lowest point of an upward-opening parabola or the highest point of a downward-opening parabola <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Calculating the Vertex

While the vertex can be identified by [[graphing_a_quadratic_function | plotting points]] and observing symmetry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, there's a specific formula to calculate its exact x-coordinate. For a [[understanding_components_of_a_quadratic_equation | quadratic function]] in the standard form f(x) = ax² + bx + c:

> [!Formula] x-coordinate of the Vertex
> The x-coordinate of the vertex is given by the formula:
> $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>
> This formula is derived directly from the [[introduction_to_the_quadratic_formula | quadratic formula]], which itself is obtained by completing the square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

Once the x-coordinate is found, substitute this value back into the original function to find the corresponding y-coordinate of the vertex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Significance for the Range

The vertex plays a crucial role in determining the [[range_of_a_quadratic_function | range of a quadratic function]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

*   **Upward-opening parabola:** If the parabola opens upwards (meaning the 'a' coefficient in ax² + bx + c is positive), the vertex represents the minimum y-value the function will ever take <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. The [[range_of_a_quadratic_function | range]] will be all real numbers greater than or equal to the y-coordinate of the vertex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   **Downward-opening parabola:** If the parabola opens downwards (meaning the 'a' coefficient is negative), the vertex represents the maximum y-value. The [[range_of_a_quadratic_function | range]] will be all real numbers less than or equal to the y-coordinate of the vertex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## Example: f(x) = 3x² + 6x - 2

Let's find the vertex of the function f(x) = 3x² + 6x - 2.
Here, a = 3 and b = 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

1.  **Calculate the x-coordinate:**
    $x = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{6}{2 \times 3} = -\frac{6}{6} = -1$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>

2.  **Calculate the y-coordinate:**
    Substitute x = -1 into the function:
    f(-1) = 3(-1)² + 6(-1) - 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>
    f(-1) = 3(1) - 6 - 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>
    f(-1) = 3 - 6 - 2 = -3 - 2 = -5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>

The vertex of the parabola is at **(-1, -5)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

Since the coefficient 'a' (3) is positive, the parabola opens upwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, and the vertex represents the minimum point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. This means the lowest output value the function can generate is -5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Therefore, the [[range_of_a_quadratic_function | range]] of f(x) = 3x² + 6x - 2 is all real numbers greater than or equal to -5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. The [[domain_of_a_quadratic_function | domain]] of this [[quadratic_polynomials | quadratic function]] is all real numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

[[glycolysis | Glycolysis]] is a fundamental biochemical pathway found in nearly all known life forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Its primary function is to break down glucose, a six-carbon molecule, into two three-carbon pyruvate molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## [[glycolysis_process_and_outcomes | Process and Outcomes]]

The overall [[glycolysis_process_and_outcomes | process of glycolysis]] yields a net production of two ATP molecules and the [[reduction_of_nad_to_nadh_in_glycolysis | reduction of two NAD+ molecules to two NADH molecules]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

The NADH produced can later be oxidized in the [[overview_of_the_electron_transport_chain | electron transport chain]] to generate additional ATP through oxidative phosphorylation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## [[investment_and_payoff_phases_of_glycolysis | Investment and Payoff Phases]]

[[glycolysis | Glycolysis]] is divided into two main phases:

### Investment Phase
In the [[investment_and_payoff_phases_of_glycolysis | investment phase]], two ATP molecules are consumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   **Step 1:** Glucose is phosphorylated to glucose-6-phosphate, utilizing one ATP molecule. This reaction is strongly favored in the forward direction and is facilitated by the enzyme hexokinase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **Step 2:** Glucose-6-phosphate is converted to fructose-6-phosphate by phosphoglucose isomerase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. This reaction is in equilibrium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   **Step 3:** Fructose-6-phosphate is phosphorylated to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, consuming a second ATP molecule. This strong forward reaction is catalyzed by phosphofructokinase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
*   **Step 4:** Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is cleaved into two three-carbon molecules: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), by the enzyme fructose bisphosphate aldolase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
*   **Step 5:** DHAP is converted to G3P by triose phosphate isomerase, ensuring both three-carbon molecules continue through the rest of the pathway as G3P <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. From this point, all subsequent reactions occur twice per original glucose molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

### Payoff Phase
The [[investment_and_payoff_phases_of_glycolysis | payoff phase]] generates four ATP molecules, resulting in a net gain of two ATPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **Step 6:** Each G3P molecule is phosphorylated and oxidized, leading to the [[reduction_of_nad_to_nadh_in_glycolysis | reduction of NAD+ to NADH]]. This step is catalyzed by a dehydrogenase and produces 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   **Step 7:** A phosphate group is removed from each 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, generating ATP and forming 3-phosphoglycerate. This is catalyzed by phosphoglycerate kinase. Since there are two molecules, this yields two ATPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
*   **Step 8:** 3-phosphoglycerate is rearranged to 2-phosphoglycerate by phosphoglycerate mutase, an isomerase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
*   **Step 9:** 2-phosphoglycerate loses a water molecule to become phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), catalyzed by enolase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
*   **Step 10:** The final step involves the transfer of a phosphate group from PEP to ADP, producing ATP and pyruvate (or pyruvic acid). This highly exergonic reaction is catalyzed by pyruvate kinase, yielding another two ATPs (total of four from payoff phase) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

## [[role_of_enzymes_in_glycolysis | Role of Enzymes]]

All steps in [[glycolysis | glycolysis]] are facilitated by [[role_of_enzymes_in_glycolysis | enzymes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. [[role_of_enzymes_in_glycolysis | Enzymes]] function by lowering the activation energy required for reactions to occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   **Kinases:** A general term for [[role_of_enzymes_in_glycolysis | enzymes]] that facilitate phosphorylation (adding a phosphate group) or dephosphorylation (removing a phosphate group) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Examples include hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
    *   Some kinases, like hexokinase and phosphofructokinase, utilize co-factors such as magnesium ions to help stabilize negative charges and lower activation energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   **Isomerases:** [[role_of_enzymes_in_glycolysis | Enzymes]] that help convert one isomer of a molecule to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Examples include phosphoglucose isomerase and triose phosphate isomerase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Mutases are a class of isomerases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
*   **Aldolase:** Facilitates the aldol reaction, which in this context, breaks a molecule into two smaller ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
*   **Dehydrogenase:** Involved in oxidation-reduction reactions, such as the [[reduction_of_nad_to_nadh_in_glycolysis | reduction of NAD+ to NADH]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

## Connection to Cellular Respiration

[[glycolysis | Glycolysis]] is typically the initial stage of cellular respiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   **Aerobic conditions:** If oxygen is available, the pyruvate and NADH products can enter the mitochondria for further breakdown in the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle) and oxidative phosphorylation to produce significantly more ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Anaerobic conditions:** In the absence of oxygen, cells undergo anaerobic respiration or fermentation, primarily to replenish NAD+ for glycolysis to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

[[glycolysis_and_its_role_in_cellular_respiration | Glycolysis]] is an incredibly important biochemical pathway that occurs in practically all life as we know it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Its primary purpose is to take [[overview_of_cellular_respiration | glucose]] as a fuel and break it up into two [[glycolysis_phases_and_process | pyruvate]] molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. [[overview_of_cellular_respiration | Glucose]] is a six-carbon molecule, while each of the [[glycolysis_phases_and_process | pyruvate]] molecules are three-carbon molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Key Outputs and Net Energy Yield
The process of [[glycolysis_and_its_role_in_cellular_respiration | glycolysis]] directly produces a net of two [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATPs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This net yield is achieved through an "investment phase" and a "payoff phase" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. In the investment phase, two [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATPs]] are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Subsequently, four [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATPs]] are produced, resulting in a net gain of two [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATPs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Role of NAD and NADH
Beyond [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATP]] production, [[glycolysis_and_its_role_in_cellular_respiration | glycolysis]] also involves the reduction of [[role_of_nad_and_nadh_in_glycolysis | NAD]] to [[role_of_nad_and_nadh_in_glycolysis | NADH]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Reduction means gaining electrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. [[role_of_nad_and_nadh_in_glycolysis | NAD]] (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) gains a hydrogen and an electron, effectively gaining a hydride anion on a net basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Two [[role_of_nad_and_nadh_in_glycolysis | NADs]] are reduced to two [[role_of_nad_and_nadh_in_glycolysis | NADHs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. These [[role_of_nad_and_nadh_in_glycolysis | NADHs]] can later be oxidized in the electron transport chain to produce even more [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATPs]] through oxidative phosphorylation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

## Connection to Cellular Respiration
[[glycolysis_and_its_role_in_cellular_respiration | Glycolysis]] is typically just the beginning of [[overview_of_cellular_respiration | cellular respiration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   If oxygen is present, the products of [[glycolysis_and_its_role_in_cellular_respiration | glycolysis]] move into the mitochondria for the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle) and oxidative phosphorylation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   If oxygen is not present, anaerobic respiration or fermentation occurs, which focuses on handling these products and replenishing [[role_of_nad_and_nadh_in_glycolysis | NAD+]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

> [!INFO] Complexity of Cellular Processes
> The processes like [[glycolysis_and_its_role_in_cellular_respiration | glycolysis]] involve immense complexity happening throughout the body billions of times at any given moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. These reactions are essential for basic bodily functions, including muscle movement and breathing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

## Functional Steps and Enzymes Involved in Glycolysis
The process of [[glycolysis_and_its_role_in_cellular_respiration | glycolysis]] involves a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Enzymes lower the activation energy of reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

### Investment Phase
This phase consumes [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATP]].
1.  **Phosphorylation of [[overview_of_cellular_respiration | Glucose]]**: [[overview_of_cellular_respiration | Glucose]] (a six-carbon molecule) is phosphorylated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
    *   **Enzyme**: Hexokinase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a> (a general term for an enzyme facilitating phosphorylation).
    *   **Co-factor**: Magnesium ion (Mg²⁺) helps lower activation energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
    *   **Energy Input**: Uses one [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. This reaction strongly favors the forward direction due to coupled free energy release from [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
2.  **Isomerization**: [[overview_of_cellular_respiration | Glucose]] 6-phosphate is converted to fructose 6-phosphate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
    *   **Enzyme**: Phosphoglucose isomerase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a> (an isomerase helps convert one isomer of a molecule to another) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

    *   **Co-factor**: Magnesium (Mg²⁺) helps stabilize negative charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
    *   **Energy Input**: Uses another [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. This is a very strong forward reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
4.  **Cleavage**: The six-carbon molecule (fructose 1,6-bisphosphate) is broken into two three-carbon chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
    *   **Enzyme**: Fructose bisphosphate aldolase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a> (aldolase enzymes facilitate aldol reactions, which can involve breaking or merging molecules) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. The two three-carbon chains are glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
5.  **Isomerization of DHAP**: Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) is converted to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
    *   **Enzyme**: Triose phosphate isomerase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
    *   At this point, effectively, there are two molecules of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate entering the next phase for every initial [[overview_of_cellular_respiration | glucose]] molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

### Payoff Phase
This phase produces [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATP]] and [[role_of_nad_and_nadh_in_glycolysis | NADH]]. Everything from here on happens twice for each original [[overview_of_cellular_respiration | glucose]] molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
1.  **Oxidation and Phosphorylation**: Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is oxidized, and another phosphate group is added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
    *   **Enzyme**: Dehydrogenase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a> (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase).
    *   **Output**: Two [[role_of_nad_and_nadh_in_glycolysis | NADs]] are reduced to two [[role_of_nad_and_nadh_in_glycolysis | NADHs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. These can be used later in the electron transport chain to produce more [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
2.  **First [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATP]] Production**: A phosphate group is removed, generating [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

    *   **Energy Output**: Produces two [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATPs]] (since it happens twice) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
3.  **Phosphate Group Relocation**: The remaining phosphate group is moved to a different carbon on the molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
    *   **Enzyme**: Phosphoglycerate mutase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a> (a mutase is a class of isomerases that relocates a functional group within a molecule) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.
4.  **Dehydration**: A water molecule is removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

    *   **Enzyme**: [[functional_steps_and_enzymes_involved_in_glycolysis | Pyruvate]] kinase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a> (a kinase defosphorylates in this context) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.
    *   **Energy Output**: Produces another two [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATPs]] (since it happens twice) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

The overall net yield of [[glycolysis_and_its_role_in_cellular_respiration | glycolysis]] is two net [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATPs]] and two [[role_of_nad_and_nadh_in_glycolysis | NADHs]] per [[overview_of_cellular_respiration | glucose]] molecule, along with two [[glycolysis_phases_and_process | pyruvate]] molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

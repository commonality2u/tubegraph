Glycolysis is an essential biochemical pathway found in nearly all forms of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Its primary function is to break down [[role_of_glucose_in_energy_production | glucose]], a six-carbon molecule, into two three-carbon molecules called pyruvate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. The term "glycolysis" itself signifies "lising the glucose," meaning breaking it up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## [[net_energy_yield_in_glycolysis | Net Energy Yield]] and [[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | Key Products]]

The [[glycolysis_process_and_its_role_in_breaking_down_glucose | glycolysis process]] results in a [[net_energy_yield_in_glycolysis | net production of two ATP molecules]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This [[atp_production_in_glycolysis | ATP production]] involves two phases:
*   **Investment Phase**: Two ATPs are consumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   **Payoff Phase**: Four ATPs are produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
This leads to a net gain of two ATPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

In addition to ATP, glycolysis also involves the [[role_of_nad_in_glycolysis | reduction of NAD+ to NADH]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Two molecules of NAD+ are reduced to two molecules of NADH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Reduction means gaining electrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. NADH can later be oxidized in the electron transport chain to potentially produce more ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Glycolysis as a Beginning

Glycolysis is typically the initial step of cellular respiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   If oxygen is present, the products of glycolysis move into the mitochondria for further processes like the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle) and oxidative phosphorylation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   If oxygen is absent, anaerobic respiration or fermentation occurs, which focuses on regenerating NAD+ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## [[glycolysis_process_and_phases | Detailed Glycolysis Process and Phases]]

The [[glycolysis_process_and_phases | glycolysis process]] occurs continuously in the body, with each step often facilitated by [[enzymes_involved_in_glycolysis | enzymes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. [[enzymes_involved_in_glycolysis | Enzymes]] function by lowering the activation energy of reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### [[glycolysis_process_and_phases | Investment Phase]] (Consumption of ATP)

1.  **Phosphorylation of Glucose**:
    *   **Description**: Glucose, a six-carbon molecule, is phosphorylated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
    *   **Enzyme**: Hexokinase facilitates this step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Kinases are enzymes that facilitate phosphorylation or dephosphorylation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
    *   **Co-factor**: A magnesium ion acts as a co-factor, helping the enzyme lower activation energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
    *   **Energy Cost**: One ATP molecule is used (minus 1 ATP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. This reaction is strongly favored from left to right due to coupled energy release from ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

2.  **Isomerization to Fructose-6-Phosphate**:
    *   **Description**: Glucose-6-phosphate is converted into its isomer, fructose-6-phosphate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. This step can be in equilibrium, but the continuous conversion of products pulls the reaction forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
    *   **Enzyme**: Phosphoglucose isomerase, which helps go from one isomer of a molecule to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

3.  **Second Phosphorylation**:
    *   **Description**: Another phosphate group is attached to fructose-6-phosphate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
    *   **Enzyme**: Phosphofructokinase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
    *   **Energy Cost**: Another ATP molecule is used (minus 1 ATP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. This is also a strong forward reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. A magnesium co-factor also helps stabilize the negative charge of phosphate groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

### Cleavage Phase (Splitting the Molecule)

1.  **Splitting into Two 3-Carbon Chains**:
    *   **Description**: The six-carbon fructose bisphosphate is broken into two three-carbon chains: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and another molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
    *   **Enzyme**: Fructose biphosphate aldolase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Aldolase enzymes facilitate aldol reactions, which can involve merging or breaking molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

2.  **Interconversion of 3-Carbon Chains**:
    *   **Description**: The other three-carbon chain (dihydroxyacetone phosphate) can be converted into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
    *   **Enzyme**: Triose phosphate isomerase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
    *   **Result**: At this point, glycolysis can be thought of as proceeding with two molecules of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate for every initial glucose molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

### [[glycolysis_process_and_phases | Payoff Phase]] (Production of ATP and NADH)

Since the following [[steps_and_reactions_in_glycolysis | steps and reactions]] occur twice for each original glucose molecule, the ATP and NADH yields are doubled.

1.  **Oxidation and Phosphorylation**:
    *   **Description**: Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate is oxidized, and an inorganic phosphate group is added to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
    *   **Enzyme**: Dehydrogenase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
    *   **Result**: NAD+ is reduced to NADH (two NADH molecules produced per glucose) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

2.  **First ATP Generation**:
    *   **Description**: One phosphate group is removed from the molecule and used to produce ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
    *   **Enzyme**: Phosphoglycerate kinase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
    *   **Energy Gain**: Two ATP molecules are produced (plus 2 ATP, as this happens twice) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

3.  **Phosphate Group Relocation**:
    *   **Description**: The remaining phosphate group moves from one carbon to another within the molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
    *   **Enzyme**: Phosphoglycerate mutase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. Mutases are a class of isomerases that move functional groups within a molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

4.  **Dehydration**:
    *   **Enzyme**: Enolase facilitates this step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

5.  **Second ATP Generation and Pyruvate Formation**:
    *   **Description**: The final phosphate group is removed, forming pyruvate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.
    *   **Enzyme**: Pyruvate kinase, which dephosphorylates the molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
    *   **Energy Gain**: Another two ATP molecules are produced (plus 2 ATP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Pyruvate (or pyruvic acid, if a hydrogen is present) is considered the end product of mainstream glycolysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

In summary, the [[glycolysis_process_and_its_role_in_breaking_down_glucose | process of glycolysis]] involves an initial investment of two ATPs, followed by a payoff phase that yields two NADH molecules and four ATP molecules, for a net production of two ATPs and two NADHs per glucose molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

Statistics broadly involves understanding data and can be classified into categories such as descriptive, predictive, and inferential statistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This article will focus on [[descriptive_statistics | descriptive statistics]], specifically the concept of [[central_tendency | central tendency]] and its various measures, often referred to as averages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33">[01:33]</a>.

## What is Central Tendency?

When faced with a large set of data, [[descriptive_statistics | descriptive statistics]] aims to provide indicative numbers that represent all of that data without needing to present every single piece of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. One key aspect of this is finding a number that is "most indicative" of the set, or a number that represents the [[central_tendency | central tendency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47">[01:47]</a>. This is a frequently used term in statistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57">[01:57]</a>.

The concept of [[central_tendency | central tendency]] is often colloquially called the "average" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07">[02:07]</a>. In this context, an average is a number that provides a sense of the [[central_tendency | central tendency]] or is most representative of a data set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16">[02:16]</a>.

### Types of Averages (Measures of Central Tendency)

There are several ways to measure the [[central_tendency | central tendency]] or average of a set of numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29">[02:29]</a>. The most common [[measures_of_central_tendency | measures of central tendency]] include the [[mean_median_and_mode | mean]], the [[mean_median_and_mode | median]], and the [[mean_median_and_mode | mode]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55">[02:55]</a>. These all serve as forms of an average for a data set or population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02">[03:02]</a>.

#### The Mean (Arithmetic Mean)

The [[mean_median_and_mode | mean]], specifically the arithmetic mean, is typically what people refer to when they talk about "the average" in everyday language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26">[03:26]</a>. To [[calculating_mean | calculate]] the arithmetic mean, you sum all the numbers in a set and then divide by the total count of numbers in the set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01">[04:01]</a>.

*   **Example**: For the set {1, 1, 2, 3, 4} <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43">[03:43]</a>:
    *   Sum: 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09">[04:09]</a>
    *   Count: 5 numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16">[04:16]</a>
    *   Mean: 11 / 5 = 2.2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29">[04:29]</a>

The mean of 2.2 represents the [[central_tendency | central tendency]] of this set, indicating a number that all other numbers are relatively close to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42">[04:42]</a>.

#### The Median

The [[mean_median_and_mode | median]] is found by first arranging the numbers in a set in order (either ascending or descending) and then identifying the middle number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17">[05:17]</a>.

*   **Example**: For the sorted set {1, 1, 2, 3, 4} <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20">[05:20]</a>:
    *   There are five numbers. The middle number is 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29">[05:29]</a>.
    *   There are two numbers greater than 2 and two numbers less than 2, making 2 the median <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35">[05:35]</a>.

If a set contains an even number of data points, there isn't a single middle number. In such cases, the [[understanding_median | median]] is the arithmetic mean of the two middle numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34">[06:34]</a>.

*   **Example**: For the sorted set {1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4} <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14">[06:14]</a>:
    *   The two middle numbers are 2 and 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38">[06:38]</a>.
    *   Median: (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42">[06:42]</a>.

#### The Mode

The [[mean_median_and_mode | mode]] is the number that appears most frequently in a set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49">[07:49]</a>.

*   **Example**: For the set {1, 1, 2, 3, 4} <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43">[03:43]</a>:
    *   The number 1 appears twice, while others appear only once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53">[07:53]</a>.
    *   The mode is 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57">[07:57]</a>.

A set can have more than one mode if multiple numbers share the highest frequency. For example, in the set {1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4}, both 1 and 4 appear twice, so both could be considered modes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05">[08:05]</a>. However, in many test scenarios, there will typically be a single most common number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25">[08:25]</a>.

### Choosing the Right Measure (Outliers)

While the arithmetic [[mean_and_central_tendency | mean]] is commonly used, different [[measures_of_central_tendency | measures of central tendency]] can be more appropriate depending on the data set, especially when dealing with "outliers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43">[08:43]</a>. An outlier is a number in a data set that "really sticks out" or is very different from the others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42">[10:42]</a>.

Consider the set {3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 100} <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52">[08:52]</a>:

*   **Mean**: The sum is 5 * 3 + 100 = 115. With 6 numbers, the mean is 115 / 6 â‰ˆ 19.17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07">[09:07]</a>.
    *   In this case, 19.17 may not feel very representative of the set, as most numbers are 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42">[09:42]</a>. The arithmetic [[mean_and_central_tendency | mean]] is skewed by the outlier (100) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12">[11:12]</a>.
*   **Median**: Sorting the numbers: {3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 100}. The two middle numbers are 3 and 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07">[10:07]</a>. The median is (3 + 3) / 2 = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18">[10:18]</a>.
    *   The [[mean_median_and_mode | median]] of 3 seems like a better measure of [[central_tendency | central tendency]] for this set, as it is less affected by the extreme value of 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26">[10:26]</a>.
*   **Mode**: The most common number is 3, appearing five times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33">[11:33]</a>.
    *   The [[mean_median_and_mode | mode]] of 3 also gives a strong indication of the typical value in the set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38">[11:38]</a>.

In scenarios with outliers, the [[mean_median_and_mode | median]] and [[mean_median_and_mode | mode]] often provide a better indication of what the numbers in a set truly represent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41">[11:41]</a>. For instance, in home prices, if most houses are $100,000 but one costs a trillion, the median house price ($100,000) gives a much more accurate perception of the city's housing market than the mean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45">[10:45]</a>.

These [[measures_of_central_tendency | measures of central tendency]] are mathematical tools developed by humans to help understand large sets of data, rather than universal laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02">[07:02]</a>. Understanding them allows for better interpretation and communication of data. The next step in [[descriptive_statistics | descriptive statistics]] involves exploring how spread apart data points are from their [[central_tendency | central tendency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21">[12:21]</a>.

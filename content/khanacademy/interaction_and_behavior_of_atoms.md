For thousands of years, humans have observed that different [[Properties of substances and elements | substances]] in our environment possess distinct [[Properties of substances and elements | properties]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. These [[Properties of substances and elements | properties]] can include how they reflect light, their color, or their state (liquid, gas, or solid) at certain temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Beyond individual [[Properties of substances and elements | properties]], it was also noticed how these [[Properties of substances and elements | substances]] react with each other under specific circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Examples of such [[Properties of substances and elements | substances]] include carbon (in graphite form), lead, and gold, all of which are depicted in their solid state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Different types of air [[Properties of substances and elements | particles]], like carbon, oxygen, or nitrogen, also exhibit varying [[Properties of substances and elements | properties]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Even solid [[Elements and the periodic table | elements]] like gold or lead can become liquid if the temperature is raised high enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>, and carbon can turn into a gaseous state by burning it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Elements as Fundamental Substances

A central question arose: if a [[Properties of substances and elements | substance]] like carbon is continuously broken down into smaller chunks, is there a smallest unit that still retains the [[Properties of substances and elements | properties]] of carbon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>? The answer is yes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. These pure [[Properties of substances and elements | substances]] with specific [[Properties of substances and elements | properties]] and reactive behaviors are called [[Basic concepts of elements and atoms | elements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Carbon, lead, and gold are all [[Basic concepts of elements and atoms | elements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Historically, water was considered an [[Basic concepts of elements and atoms | element]], but we now know it is composed of more [[Basic concepts of elements and atoms | basic elements]]: oxygen and hydrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. All known [[Basic concepts of elements and atoms | elements]] are systematically listed in the [[Elements and the periodic table | Periodic Table of Elements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Atoms: The Basic Building Blocks

The most [[Basic building blocks of matter | basic unit]] of any [[Basic concepts of elements and atoms | element]] is the [[Basic concepts of elements and atoms | atom]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. If you continue to divide a [[Properties of substances and elements | substance]] like carbon, you will eventually reach a carbon [[Basic concepts of elements and atoms | atom]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. This [[Basic concepts of elements and atoms | atom]] is the smallest [[Basic building blocks of matter | particle]] that still retains the [[Properties of substances and elements | properties]] of that [[Basic concepts of elements and atoms | element]]; breaking it down further would cause it to lose those [[Properties of substances and elements | properties]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

[[Basic concepts of elements and atoms | Atoms]] are incredibly small; a human hair, for example, is approximately 1 million carbon [[Basic concepts of elements and atoms | atoms]] wide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. This means 1 million carbon [[Basic concepts of elements and atoms | atoms]] could be strung across the width of an average human hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

## Subatomic Particles and Their Influence

What is even more remarkable is that these [[Basic building blocks of matter | basic building blocks]]—[[Basic concepts of elements and atoms | atoms]]—are themselves composed of even more fundamental [[Atomic structure and subatomic particles | particles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. The type of [[Basic concepts of elements and atoms | element]] is defined by the arrangement and number of these fundamental [[Atomic structure and subatomic particles | particles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Changing the number of these [[Atomic structure and subatomic particles | particles]] can alter the [[Properties of substances and elements | properties]] of an [[Basic concepts of elements and atoms | element]] or even change the [[Basic concepts of elements and atoms | element]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

The three primary [[Atomic structure and subatomic particles | subatomic particles]] are:
*   **Protons**: These are the defining [[Atomic structure and subatomic particles | particles]] of an [[Basic concepts of elements and atoms | element]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. The number of protons in an [[Atomic structure and subatomic particles | atom's]] nucleus determines its [[Elements and the periodic table | atomic number]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. For instance, hydrogen always has one proton, helium has two, and carbon has six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. If the number of protons changes, the [[Basic concepts of elements and atoms | element]] itself changes (e.g., carbon with seven protons becomes nitrogen) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Protons carry a positive charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.
*   **Neutrons**: These [[Atomic structure and subatomic particles | particles]] reside with protons in the [[Atomic structure and subatomic particles | atom's nucleus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. The number of neutrons can vary within the same [[Basic concepts of elements and atoms | element]] (e.g., Carbon-12 has six neutrons, while Carbon-14 has eight) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. Neutrons are electrically neutral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
*   **Electrons**: These [[Atomic structure and subatomic particles | particles]] orbit or "buzz around" the nucleus of an [[Atomic structure and subatomic particles | atom]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. In a neutral [[Atomic structure and subatomic particles | atom]], the number of electrons equals the number of protons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. Electrons carry a negative charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

### Interaction and Chemical Behavior

The [[Atomic structure and subatomic particles | particles]] within an [[Basic concepts of elements and atoms | atom]] dictate its [[Interaction and behavior of atoms | behavior]] and [[Interaction and behavior of atoms | interactions]].
*   **Attraction**: Protons (positive charge) and electrons (negative charge) are attracted to each other due to their opposite charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. This attraction binds the electrons to the nucleus, forming the [[Basic concepts of elements and atoms | atom]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.
*   **Electron Configuration and Reactions**: A large part of understanding [[Importance of chemistry in understanding natural phenomena | chemistry]] revolves around the number and configuration of electrons in an [[Basic concepts of elements and atoms | atom]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. The way electrons are arranged and how they interact with electrons from other [[Basic concepts of elements and atoms | atoms]] determines how [[Basic concepts of elements and atoms | atoms]] will [[Interaction and behavior of atoms | react]], bond, attract, or repel each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.
*   **Ions**: It is possible for an [[Atomic structure and subatomic particles | atom]] to lose or gain electrons, leading to a net electrical charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. For example, if a carbon [[Atomic structure and subatomic particles | atom]] (normally with six protons and six electrons) loses an electron, it will have six protons and five electrons, resulting in a net positive charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. This concept of changing electron numbers is fundamental to [[Importance of chemistry in understanding natural phenomena | chemical reactions]].

The study of how these [[Basic building blocks of matter | fundamental building blocks]]—[[Basic concepts of elements and atoms | atoms]] and their [[Atomic structure and subatomic particles | subatomic particles]]—interact and behave is central to [[Importance of chemistry in understanding natural phenomena | chemistry]] and allows for predicting and understanding countless natural phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

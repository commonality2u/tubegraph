Economics, as a field of study, gained significant modern definition with the work of Scottish philosopher Adam Smith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. He is considered the first true economist in the contemporary sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Adam Smith and the Invisible Hand

Adam Smith's renowned work, *The Wealth of Nations*, published in 1776 (the same year as the American Declaration of Independence), introduced foundational concepts still central to the discipline today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. One of his most famous excerpts details the concept of the "invisible hand":

> "He generally indeed, he being an economic actor, neither intends to promote the public interest, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a> nor knows how much he is promoting it. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a> By directing that industry, so that the industry in control of that individual actor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a> in such a manner, as its produce may be of the greatest value, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a> he intends only his own gain. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a> And he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a> to promote an end which was no part of his intention. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>"

This notion posits that when individual actors pursue their own self-interest, it often leads to outcomes beneficial for society that were not explicitly intended by those individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Smith further stated that this outcome "is not always the worst for society" and that by pursuing self-interest, one "frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

This idea is central to capitalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a> and significantly influenced the foundational ideas of the United States, alongside the Declaration of Independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. While Adam Smith likely wouldn't suggest that self-interested actions are *always* good or that people should *never* consider aggregate implications, he argued that such actions can frequently lead to greater good, innovation, investment, productivity, and overall wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

## Branches of Economics: Microeconomics and Macroeconomics

Modern economics typically divides itself into two main subjects: [[microeconomics_and_macroeconomics | microeconomics]] and [[microeconomics_and_macroeconomics | macroeconomics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Adam Smith's statements often touched upon both, discussing individual self-interest (micro) and its broader impact on the economy (macro) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

### Microeconomics

[[microeconomics_and_macroeconomics | Microeconomics]] is the study of individual actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. These actors can include firms, people, or households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. It focuses on how these actors make decisions or allocations of [[scarce_resources_and_economic_decision_making | scarce resources]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. A [[scarce_resources_and_economic_decision_making | scarce resource]] is one that is not infinite, such as food, water, money, time, or labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. [[microeconomics_and_macroeconomics | Microeconomics]] explores how these resources are deployed and how that impacts prices and markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

### Macroeconomics

[[microeconomics_and_macroeconomics | Macroeconomics]] is the study of what happens to an economy in aggregate, considering the collective actions of millions of individual actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. It often focuses on policy-related questions, such as the effects of raising or lowering taxes, or regulating versus deregulating industries, and how these affect overall productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

## The Role of Mathematical Models in Economics

In both [[microeconomics_and_macroeconomics | microeconomics]] and [[microeconomics_and_macroeconomics | macroeconomics]], especially in the modern era, there is a strong emphasis on making the subjects rigorous and [[economics_and_mathematical_models | mathematical]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. This approach starts with philosophical or logical ideas about human decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

To make these ideas manageable for [[economics_and_mathematical_models | mathematical]] analysis, economists often simplify assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. For example, they might assume that all people are rational, always act in their own self-interest, or always seek to maximize gain, even though human beings are motivated by many factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

This [[economics_and_mathematical_models | mathematical]] approach offers several benefits:
*   It clarifies thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   It allows for proving things based on stated assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   It enables visualization of economic concepts through charts and graphs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

However, relying heavily on [[economics_and_mathematical_models | mathematical models]] also presents dangers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. The major simplifications made can lead to strong conclusions that might feel proven, but are based on assumptions that could be wrong, oversimplified, or irrelevant to the specific context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. This is particularly true in [[microeconomics_and_macroeconomics | macroeconomics]], where the infinitely complicated interactions of millions of people are aggregated, making the system fundamentally unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Therefore, it is crucial to take these models and conclusions "with a grain of salt," always remembering the underlying simplifying assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. The most important goal is to develop true intuition for economic phenomena, even without the [[economics_and_mathematical_models | mathematics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

## Perspectives on Economists

### Alfred Knopf
Alfred Knopf, a publisher in the 1900s, offered a humorous yet insightful observation:
> "An economist is a man who states the obvious in terms of the incomprehensible." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>

This quote highlights that economics often takes common-sense, obvious ideas and expresses them through complex, [[economics_and_mathematical_models | mathematical]] terminology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. It underscores the importance of maintaining intuition alongside [[economics_and_mathematical_models | mathematical]] understanding, and recognizing when the math might be steering towards strange conclusions due to oversimplifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

### Lawrence J. Peter
Lawrence J. Peter, known for Peter's Principals, provided another telling quote:
> "An economist is an expert know will know tomorrow why the things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a> he predicted yesterday didn't happen today." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>

This statement is especially relevant to [[microeconomics_and_macroeconomics | macroeconomics]], where economists frequently make predictions about the economy, such as recessions, growth, or inflation, which often prove incorrect and on which economists frequently disagree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. While the [[economics_and_mathematical_models | mathematics]] can make economics *seem* like a science akin to physics, it is fundamentally different. Economics is open to subjectivity, largely due to the assumptions chosen for its models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

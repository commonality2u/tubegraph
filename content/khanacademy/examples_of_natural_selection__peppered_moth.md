Evolution is often considered the most misunderstood concept in science, and has become contentious in popular culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:07]</a>. The common understanding of "evolution" often depicts a linear progression, such as an ape slowly becoming more upright to resemble a human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:59]</a>. This implies an active process where an ape "changed" into a human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, or a desire for change, like a cow stretching its neck to become a giraffe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:29]</a>. However, this is not what [[misunderstandings_about_evolution | evolution]] truly is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

The preferred term for this process is [[natural_selection_and_variation | natural selection]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:42]</a>.

## Natural Selection Explained
[[natural_selection_and_variation | Natural selection]] operates on the principle of [[natural_selection_and_variation | variation]] within a population of living organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:59]</a>. Variation refers to natural differences observed among individuals, such as variations in height or hair color among school children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:17]</a>. [[natural_selection_and_variation | Natural selection]] is the process where environmental factors "select" for certain variations within a population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:24]</a>. Some variations may be insignificant, while others can be crucial for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:31]</a>.

### The Peppered Moth Example
A classic illustration of [[natural_selection_and_variation | natural selection]] is the case of the peppered moth in pre-Industrial Revolution England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:39]</a>.

*   **Initial Variation**
    Before the Industrial Revolution, there was natural [[natural_selection_and_variation | variation]] in the peppered moth population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:07]</a>. Some moths were lighter with spots, while others were darker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:33]</a>. For thousands of years, this color variation was not a significant trait for their survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:44]</a>. Moths would typically rest on tree trunks, which might have been grey or white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:12]</a>.

*   **Environmental Change: Industrial Revolution**
    The Industrial Revolution led to significant environmental changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:51]</a>. Factories burning coal released vast amounts of soot, which covered much of the environment, including tree trunks, making them darker, often pitch black <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:06:34]</a>.

*   **Selection Pressure**
    With the environment becoming darker, the moths' camouflage became a critical factor for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:40]</a>. Birds, predators of the moths, could now more easily spot the lighter-colored moths against the darkened tree trunks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:07:04]</a>. The darker moths, however, blended in more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

*   **Outcome: Shift in Population**
    Birds preyed on the lighter moths more frequently, often before they could reproduce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:19]</a>. Consequently, the darker moths had a higher chance of surviving and reproducing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:25]</a>. Over generations, the population of peppered moths shifted, with a significant increase in the number of darker moths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:32]</a>.

### Not an Active Design
It's crucial to understand that this change was not a result of the moths actively deciding to become black <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:08:02]</a>. There was no "design" or intelligent process at play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:42]</a>. Instead, the pre-existing [[natural_selection_and_variation | variation]] within the peppered moth population, coupled with the environmental change, led to certain variations being naturally "selected" for reproductive success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:29]</a>. The lighter moths were eaten more, reducing their ability to pass on their traits, while the darker moths reproduced more successfully, making their trait dominant in the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:32]</a>.

This process demonstrates how [[natural_selection_and_variation | natural selection]] works: random [[natural_selection_and_variation | variations]] occur, and the environment favors those that are better adapted, leading to a shift in the population's traits over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:33]</a>.

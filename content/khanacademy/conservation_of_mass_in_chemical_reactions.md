[[Balancing chemical equations | Balancing chemical equations]] is a concept in chemistry that can initially seem confusing, but becomes manageable with a careful and methodical approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It is important to appreciate the art involved in this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## What is a Chemical Equation?
A [[introduction_to_chemical_equations | chemical equation]] describes a reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. For example, an atom of aluminum reacting with a dioxygen molecule (O₂) under appropriate conditions forms aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The aluminum oxide molecule contains two aluminum atoms and three oxygen atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Why Balance Chemical Equations?
The core reason for [[balancing_chemical_equations | balancing chemical equations]] is to adhere to the principle of conservation of mass, meaning that atoms cannot simply appear or disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. The number of each type of atom must be the same on both the reactant (left) and product (right) sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

Consider the initial unbalanced reaction:
Al + O₂ → Al₂O₃

Initially, if we examine the atom counts:
*   **Aluminum (Al)**
    *   Left side (reactants): 1 atom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>
    *   Right side (products): 2 atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>
*   **Oxygen (O)**
    *   Left side (reactants): 2 atoms (in one dioxygen molecule) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>
    *   Right side (products): 3 atoms (in one aluminum oxide molecule) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>

Since atoms cannot miraculously appear or vanish, the number of aluminum and oxygen atoms must be balanced on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Steps Towards Balancing

### Initial Adjustment
To balance the aluminum, we can place a coefficient of '2' in front of the aluminum atom on the left side, changing it from 1 to 2 atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

2Al + O₂ → Al₂O₃

Now, aluminum is balanced with 2 atoms on each side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. However, oxygen remains unbalanced, with 2 atoms on the left and 3 on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

### Addressing Fractional Coefficients and [[Whole Number Convention in Chemical Equations | Whole Number Convention]]
To balance the oxygen, one might consider multiplying the O₂ molecule by 1.5 (since 1.5 * 2 = 3), which would balance the oxygen atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

2Al + 1.5O₂ → Al₂O₃

While this balances the atoms, the convention in chemistry is to use [[whole_number_convention_in_chemical_equations | whole numbers]] for coefficients, avoiding "1.5 molecules" or fractional amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

Similar to algebraic equations, the entire equation can be multiplied by a number to eliminate the fraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. To eliminate the 1.5, we can multiply all coefficients by 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

Original state after initial aluminum balance:
2Al + 1.5O₂ → 1Al₂O₃ (implicitly, 1 molecule of aluminum oxide) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>

Multiplying all coefficients by 2:
*   2 (from aluminum) * 2 = 4
*   1.5 (from dioxygen) * 2 = 3
*   1 (from aluminum oxide) * 2 = 2

This results in the balanced equation:
4Al + 3O₂ → 2Al₂O₃ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>

### Verification of the Balanced Equation
Let's verify the atom counts in the balanced equation:
4Al + 3O₂ → 2Al₂O₃

*   **Aluminum (Al)**
    *   Left side: 4 atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>
    *   Right side: 2 molecules of Al₂O₃ mean 2 * 2 = 4 atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>
*   **Oxygen (O)**
    *   Left side: 3 molecules of O₂ mean 3 * 2 = 6 atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>
    *   Right side: 2 molecules of Al₂O₃ mean 2 * 3 = 6 atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>

Both aluminum and oxygen atoms are now balanced on both sides, demonstrating the conservation of mass in the chemical reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

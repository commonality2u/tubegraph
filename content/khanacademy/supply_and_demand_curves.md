In economic analysis, [[graphing demand curves | graphing]] the concepts of supply and demand helps visualize market dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. For instance, in the apple market, a graph can be set up with price per pound on the vertical axis and the quantity of apples (e.g., in thousands of pounds per week) on the horizontal axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## [[demand_schedule_and_demand_curve | Demand Curve]]

The [[demand_schedule_and_demand_curve | demand curve]] illustrates the relationship between the price of a good and the [[effects of price changes on quantity demanded | quantity consumers are willing and able to purchase]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   **High Price, Low Demand**: If the price of apples is very high (e.g., $5 a pound), consumers will not [[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | demand]] much, leading to a low [[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] (e.g., 500 pounds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **Low Price, High Demand**: Conversely, if the price is low (e.g., $1 a pound), the [[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] will be high (e.g., 4,000 pounds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

This inverse relationship causes the [[demand_schedule_and_demand_curve | demand curve]] to slope downwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. It's important to distinguish that [[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | "quantity demanded"]] refers to a specific amount at a specific price, while [[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | "demand"]] refers to the entire relationship between price and quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This aligns with the [[law of demand | law of demand]].

## Supply Curve

The supply curve shows the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity producers are willing to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Low Price, Low Supply**: There is typically a price below which producers are not willing to supply any apples (e.g., 50 cents) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. At $1 a pound, a supplier might only be willing to supply 1,000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **High Price, High Supply**: As the price increases, the quantity producers are willing to supply also increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. For example, at $3 a pound, suppliers might be willing to produce 3,000 pounds of apples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

This direct relationship causes the supply curve to slope upwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## [[market_shortages_and_surpluses | Market Shortages and Surpluses]]

Markets naturally adjust based on the interplay of supply and demand, often correcting imbalances in [[Market shortages and surpluses | quantity supplied]] and [[Market shortages and surpluses | quantity demanded]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

### Shortage
A [[market_shortages_and_surpluses | shortage]] occurs when the [[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] exceeds the [[market_shortages_and_surpluses | quantity supplied]] at a given price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   **Example**: If suppliers set the price at $1 per pound, the [[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | quantity supplied]] might be 1,000 pounds, while the [[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] is 4,000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. This creates a [[market_shortages_and_surpluses | shortage]] of 3,000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **[[price_adjustments_and_market_dynamics | Price Adjustments]]**: In a [[market_shortages_and_surpluses | shortage]] situation, consumers will bid up prices, causing prices to increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. As prices rise, producers will increase the [[market_shortages_and_surpluses | quantity supplied]], moving up the supply curve, and consumers will [[effects of price changes on quantity demanded | demand less]], moving up the demand curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

### Surplus
A [[market_shortages_and_surpluses | surplus]] occurs when the [[market_shortages_and_surpluses | quantity supplied]] exceeds the [[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] at a given price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   **Example**: If suppliers set the price at $3 per pound, the [[market_shortages_and_surpluses | quantity supplied]] might be 3,000 pounds, but the [[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] falls to around 1,300 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. This results in a [[market_shortages_and_surpluses | surplus]] of 1,700 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   **[[price_adjustments_and_market_dynamics | Price Adjustments]]**: In a [[market_shortages_and_surpluses | surplus]] situation, producers might lower prices to sell excess inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. As prices fall, the [[market_shortages_and_surpluses | quantity supplied]] will decrease (moving down the supply curve), and the [[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] will increase (moving down the demand curve) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

## [[equilibrium_price_and_quantity | Equilibrium Price and Quantity]]

Market forces naturally push towards a point where the supply and demand curves intersect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   **Definition**: This intersection point represents the [[equilibrium_price_and_quantity | equilibrium price]] and [[equilibrium_price_and_quantity | equilibrium quantity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
*   **Equilibrium Price**: The [[equilibrium_price_and_quantity | equilibrium price]] is the price at which the [[market_shortages_and_surpluses | quantity supplied]] equals the [[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. In the apple market example, this might be around $2.15 per pound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
*   **Equilibrium Quantity**: The [[equilibrium_price_and_quantity | equilibrium quantity]] is the quantity traded at the [[equilibrium_price_and_quantity | equilibrium price]] where [[market_shortages_and_surpluses | quantity supplied]] equals [[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. This could be around 2,200 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

At [[equilibrium_price_and_quantity | equilibrium]], the market is stable; all apples produced are sold, and none go to waste, benefiting both consumers and producers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

[[cellular_respiration]] is considered a fundamental biochemical reaction, especially for humans, as it is the process through which energy is derived from food or fuel, specifically glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Most carbohydrates consumed are eventually converted into glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

The overall process of [[cellular_respiration]] converts glucose into energy and other byproducts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Chemical Reaction

The chemical formula for glucose is C₆H₁₂O₆ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The simplified chemical reaction for [[cellular_respiration]] is:
1 mole of Glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆) + 6 moles of molecular Oxygen (O₂) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, through the process of [[cellular_respiration]], produces:
*   6 moles of Carbon Dioxide (CO₂) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>
*   6 moles of Water (H₂O) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>
*   Energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>

This energy is utilized for various bodily functions, such as doing useful work, heating the body, and providing electrical impulses in the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## Energy Production and ATP

While [[cellular_respiration]] produces energy directly, this energy is then used to generate [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]], which is the primary energy currency for biological systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Some of the energy produced is released as heat, warming the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

Textbooks commonly state that [[cellular_respiration]] produces 38 [[atp_production_through_cellular_respiration | ATPs]] per mole of glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. However, in reality, due to the efficiency of the cell, the actual production can be closer to 29 to 30 [[atp_production_through_cellular_respiration | ATPs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. There is still significant variation and ongoing study in this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

## Stages of Cellular Respiration

[[cellular_respiration]] occurs in three main [[stages_of_cellular_respiration | stages]]:

### 1. [[Overview of glycolysis | Glycolysis]]
*   **Meaning:** "Breaking up glucose" (from "glyco" for glucose and "lysis" meaning to break up) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   **Process:** It involves splitting a 6-carbon glucose molecule into two 3-carbon molecules called pyruvate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   **Oxygen Requirement:** [[Glycolysis and its role in cellular respiration | Glycolysis]] does not require oxygen and is therefore considered an [[anaerobic_vs_aerobic_processes_in_cellular_respiration | anaerobic process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **ATP Production:** It initially needs 2 [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATPs]] but generates 4 [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATPs]], resulting in a net gain of 2 [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATPs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   **Other Products:** It also produces NADHs, which are crucial for later stages of [[cellular_respiration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

### 2. Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle)
*   **Process:** The byproducts of glycolysis are re-engineered and then enter the Krebs cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
*   **Oxygen Requirement:** This stage is [[anaerobic_vs_aerobic_processes_in_cellular_respiration | aerobic]], meaning it requires oxygen to proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.
*   **ATP Production:** It generates an additional 2 [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATPs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   **Other Products:** Similar to glycolysis, the Krebs cycle also produces more NADHs and FADH, which will drive the final stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

### 3. Electron Transport Chain (ETC)
*   **Process:** This process occurs after glycolysis and the Krebs cycle, driven primarily by the NADHs and FADHs produced in the earlier stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.
*   **Oxygen Requirement:** The Electron Transport Chain is also an [[anaerobic_vs_aerobic_processes_in_cellular_respiration | aerobic process]], requiring oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
*   **ATP Production:** It is responsible for producing the majority of [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATPs]], approximately 34 [[atp_production_through_cellular_respiration | ATPs]] in ideal conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

## Anaerobic Processes: Fermentation

If oxygen is not available, the later [[stages of cellular respiration | stages]] (Krebs cycle and Electron Transport Chain) cannot proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. In such cases, the byproducts of [[overview_of_glycolysis | glycolysis]] enter a side process called fermentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

*   **Alcohol Fermentation:** Some organisms, like yeast, convert the byproducts of glycolysis into alcohol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
*   **Lactic Acid Fermentation:** Human muscles, when deprived of sufficient oxygen (e.g., during intense sprinting), produce lactic acid, which can cause muscle aching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

This anaerobic pathway provides only a small amount of energy compared to the full aerobic [[cellular_respiration]] process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

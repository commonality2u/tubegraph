[[dna_structure_as_the_molecular_basis_of_heredity | DNA]] is the fundamental component that defines what a living organism is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50"></a>. All [[cellular_structure_and_functions#Cells | cells]] contain [[dna_structure_as_the_molecular_basis_of_heredity | DNA]] within them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55"></a>.

## Structure and Location

The [[dna_structure_as_the_molecular_basis_of_heredity | DNA]] within a [[cellular_structure_and_functions#Cells | cell]] typically exists in its chromatin form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16"></a>, which includes associated proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18"></a>.

### Nucleus
A major distinction in the living world is whether a [[cellular_structure_and_functions#Cells | cell]] contains a membrane around its [[dna_structure_as_the_molecular_basis_of_heredity | DNA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52"></a>. This surrounding membrane forms a compartment called the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08"></a>, which separates the [[dna_structure_as_the_molecular_basis_of_heredity | DNA]] and its associated chromatin from the rest of the [[cellular_structure_and_functions#Cells | cell]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58"></a>.

### Eukaryotes vs. Prokaryotes
The presence or absence of a nucleus is a key way to classify organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21"></a>.
*   **[[cellular_structure_and_functions#Eukaryotes | Eukaryotes]]**: These [[cellular_structure_and_functions#Cells | cells]] possess a nucleus that encloses their [[dna_structure_as_the_molecular_basis_of_heredity | DNA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37"></a>. Examples of [[cellular_structure_and_functions#Eukaryotes | eukaryotes]] include plants, animals (like humans), and fungi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57"></a>.
*   **[[cellular_structure_and_functions#Prokaryotes | Prokaryotes]]**: These [[cellular_structure_and_functions#Cells | cells]] do not have a nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40"></a>. Their [[dna_structure_as_the_molecular_basis_of_heredity | DNA]] is not membrane-bound. The two main groups of [[cellular_structure_and_functions#Prokaryotes | prokaryotes]] are bacteria and Archaea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48"></a>.

## Role in Protein Production
[[dna_structure_as_the_molecular_basis_of_heredity | DNA]] serves as the blueprint for protein synthesis, a fundamental process in [[cellular_structure_and_functions#Cells | cells]].
1.  **Transcription**: [[dna_structure_as_the_molecular_basis_of_heredity | DNA]] is transcribed into messenger [[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | RNA]] (mRNA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18"></a>. This transcription occurs inside the nucleus in [[cellular_structure_and_functions#Eukaryotes | eukaryotic]] [[cellular_structure_and_functions#Cells | cells]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04"></a>.
2.  **Translation**: The mRNA then leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosomes, where it is translated into proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04"></a>. Ribosomes are the sites where the genetic information encoded in mRNA is converted into proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18"></a>.

> [!NOTE]
> The ribosomal [[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | RNA]] (rRNA), which forms part of the ribosome's structure and function, is produced in a densely packed area within the nucleus called the nucleolus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08"></a>. The nucleolus is not a separate membrane-bound organelle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00"></a>.

## Organelles Containing Their Own DNA
Some organelles within [[cellular_structure_and_functions#Eukaryotes | eukaryotic]] [[cellular_structure_and_functions#Cells | cells]] possess their own [[dna_structure_as_the_molecular_basis_of_heredity | DNA]] and can reproduce independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48"></a>. This has led to the belief that their ancestors were once independent [[cellular_structure_and_functions#Prokaryotes | prokaryotic]] organisms that developed a symbiotic relationship with larger [[cellular_structure_and_functions#Eukaryotes | eukaryotic]] [[cellular_structure_and_functions#Cells | cells]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53"></a>.
*   **Mitochondria**: Found in both animal and plant [[cellular_structure_and_functions#Cells | cells]], these organelles are responsible for cellular respiration, converting sugars into ATP (energy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19"></a>.
*   **Chloroplasts**: Present only in plant [[cellular_structure_and_functions#Cells | cells]], chloroplasts are the sites of photosynthesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39"></a>.

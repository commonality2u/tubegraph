The [[median | median]] is one of the methods used to measure [[central_tendency_in_statistics | central tendency]] within a set of numbers, identifying the "middle" value of a data set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. Unlike the [[arithmetic_mean | arithmetic mean]] (or average), the [[median | median]] is found by ordering the numbers and selecting the value that is numerically in the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.

## Steps to Calculate the Median

To determine the [[median | median]] of a given set of numbers, follow these steps:

1.  **Order the Numbers**: Arrange all the numbers in the dataset from least to greatest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.
2.  **Identify the Middle Number(s)**:
    *   If the dataset contains an odd number of values, the [[median | median]] is the single middle number.
    *   If the dataset contains an even number of values, there will be two numbers in the middle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. In this case, calculate the [[mean_and_central_tendency | mean]] (average) of these two middle numbers to find the [[median | median]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.

## Example Calculation

Consider the following set of eight numbers: 23, 29, 20, 32, 23, 21, 33, 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.

1.  **Order the numbers from least to greatest**:
    20, 21, 23, 23, 25, 29, 32, 33 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>

2.  **Identify the middle number(s)**:
    Since there are 8 numbers (an even count), there are two middle numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.
    The two middle numbers are 23 and 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

3.  **Calculate the average of the two middle numbers**:
    Add the two middle numbers and divide by 2:
    (23 + 25) / 2 = 48 / 2 = 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.

Therefore, the [[median | median]] of this set of numbers is 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. Even if the calculated [[median | median]] (like 24 in this case) is not one of the original numbers in the set, it still represents the central value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.

The median is a [[measures_of_central_tendency|measure of central tendency]] that represents the middle number in a data set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>. It is one way to find a typical or middle value within a set of numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. To determine the median, the numbers in the data set must first be ordered from least to greatest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>.

## Calculating the Median

The calculation of the median depends on whether the data set contains an odd or even number of values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>.

### For an Even Number of Data Points

If a data set has an even number of values, there isn't a single middle number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. In this case, the median is calculated by finding the halfway point between the two middle numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>. This is essentially taking the arithmetic [[mean_and_central_tendency|mean]] of those two middle values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>.

**Example:**
Consider the plant height data set: 4, 3, 1, 6, 1, 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.
1.  Order the data: 1, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>.
2.  Identify the two middle numbers. Since there are six data points (an even number), the middle numbers are 3 and 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.
3.  Calculate the halfway point: (3 + 4) / 2 = 3.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>.
    The median for this set is 3.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>.

### For an Odd Number of Data Points

If a data set has an odd number of values, it is simpler to compute the median <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>. Once the numbers are ordered, the median is simply the single value that is exactly in the middle of the set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>.

**Example:**
Consider the data set: 0, 7, 50, 10,000, 1 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.
1.  The data is already ordered.
2.  Identify the middle number. With five numbers (an odd number), 50 is the middle value, as it has two numbers less than it and two numbers greater than it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>.
    The median for this set is 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>.

## Usefulness of the Median

The median is particularly useful when a data set contains extreme values or "outliers" that could "skew" the arithmetic [[mean_and_central_tendency|mean]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>. It provides a measure of [[central_tendency]] that is less affected by these extreme values, offering a more representative "typical" or "middle" number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

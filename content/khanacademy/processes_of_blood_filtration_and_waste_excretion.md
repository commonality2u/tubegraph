The [[functions_of_the_kidney | kidney]] is an organ primarily known for excreting waste and maintaining the body's water and salt (electrolytes) levels, as well as influencing blood pressure and producing hormones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Most individuals have two kidneys, located closer to the back, on either side of the spine, and behind the liver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## [[kidney_anatomy_and_location | Kidney Anatomy]]

When sliced, the [[kidney_anatomy_and_location | kidney]] reveals distinct internal regions:
*   **Renal Cortex** The outer part of the [[kidney_anatomy_and_location | kidney]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   **Renal Medulla** The inner part of the [[kidney_anatomy_and_location | kidney]], often described as the "middle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. These regions play a significant role in waste excretion and water conservation during blood filtration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## The Nephron: Functional Unit of the Kidney

The [[structure_and_function_of_the_nephron | nephron]] is considered the smallest functional unit of the [[kidney_anatomy_and_location | kidney]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. It is at this level that the primary functions of the [[functions_of_the_kidney | kidney]]—waste excretion and water level maintenance—occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Each [[kidney_anatomy_and_location | kidney]] contains approximately one million [[structure_and_function_of_the_nephron | nephrons]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

A [[structure_and_function_of_the_nephron | nephron]] begins in the renal cortex, dips down into the renal medulla, and then returns to the cortex before ultimately draining into collecting ducts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. The fluid collected from [[structure_and_function_of_the_nephron | nephrons]] eventually goes into the ureters and then to the urinary bladder for excretion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

## Processes of Blood Filtration

The process of blood filtration within the [[structure_and_function_of_the_nephron | nephron]] involves several stages to ensure waste is excreted while vital substances and water are reabsorbed.

### 1. Glomerular Filtration (Bowman's Capsule)

Blood enters the [[structure_and_function_of_the_nephron | nephron]] through the afferent arteriole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   **Glomerulus** The afferent arteriole branches into a capillary network called the glomerulus, which is highly porous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. The blood then leaves via the efferent arteriole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. The arterial system maintains a higher blood pressure, which is crucial for squeezing fluid and dissolved substances out of the blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
*   **Bowman's Capsule** The glomerulus is enveloped by the Bowman's capsule, a sphere with an opening where the capillary system winds around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. The space within the Bowman's capsule is known as the Bowman's space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   **Filtration** About one-fifth of the fluid entering the glomerulus is filtered into the Bowman's space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. This initial filtered fluid is called **filtrate** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
    *   **Filtered Substances:** Small ions (e.g., sodium), small molecules like glucose, and amino acids are easily filtered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
    *   **Non-filtered Substances:** Red blood cells and larger proteins are not filtered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
    *   **Podocytes:** Specialized cells called podocytes surround the glomerulus and contribute to the selective filtration process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

### 2. Tubular Reabsorption and Secretion

After filtration, the filtrate enters various tubules where reabsorption of useful substances and further processing occur.

#### Proximal Tubule
The filtrate moves from the Bowman's capsule into the proximal tubule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. This tubule is "convoluted" (curvy) and is located near the beginning of the [[structure_and_function_of_the_nephron | nephron]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Reabsorption:** The primary function here is to reabsorb substances the body needs, such as glucose, sodium, and amino acids, back into the bloodstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Some water is also reabsorbed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. This reabsorption is an active process, meaning it requires [[cellular_respiration_process | ATP]] to pump substances against their concentration gradients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

#### Loop of Henle
The filtrate then enters the Loop of Henle, which is the longest part of the [[structure_and_function_of_the_nephron | nephron]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. This loop extends from the renal cortex down into the salty renal medulla and then back up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. This unique structure is crucial for [[water_and_electrolyte_reabsorption_mechanisms | water and electrolyte reabsorption mechanisms]].
*   **Ascending Loop:** This part actively pumps out salts (sodium, potassium, chloride ions) into the renal medulla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. This process uses [[cellular_respiration_process | ATP]] and makes the medulla hypertonic (very salty) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. The ascending loop is *not* permeable to water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.
*   **Descending Loop:** This part is permeable *only* to water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. Because the surrounding medulla is very salty, water naturally moves out of the descending loop via [[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | osmosis]] to balance concentrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. This is a major mechanism for reabsorbing a significant amount of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

#### Distal Convoluted Tubule
After the Loop of Henle, the filtrate enters the distal convoluted tubule, which is "further away" from the Bowman's capsule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>.
*   **Reabsorption:** Here, more reabsorption occurs, including calcium, additional sodium, and some more water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. The goal is to recover as much useful material as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>.

#### Collecting Duct
The processed filtrate, now much more concentrated and primarily composed of waste products and excess water, is dumped into collecting ducts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. Multiple [[structure_and_function_of_the_nephron | nephrons]] drain into a single collecting duct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.
*   **Further Water Reabsorption:** The collecting duct also extends back into the salty renal medulla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>. The permeability of the collecting duct to water can be regulated by anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. If the duct is made more porous by ADH, more water can leave, making the final urine even more concentrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

Finally, the concentrated urine leaves the [[kidney_anatomy_and_location | kidney]] via the ureters and travels to the urinary bladder for storage and eventual excretion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>.

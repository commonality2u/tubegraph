The [[kidney_anatomy_and_function | kidney]] is an organ primarily known for producing and excreting waste products from the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Beyond waste excretion, it also maintains water levels, manages salt and electrolyte balance, and regulates blood pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. These functions are performed at the [[the_nephron_structure | smallest functional level]], which is the [[the_nephron_structure | nephron]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Each [[kidney_anatomy_and_function | kidney]] typically contains about one million [[the_nephron_structure | nephrons]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## Kidney Anatomy Overview
The [[kidney_anatomy_and_function | kidney]] is generally located closer to the back, on either side of the spine, behind the liver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Internally, the [[kidney_anatomy_and_function | kidney]] is divided into two main regions:
*   **Renal Cortex** This is the outer part of the [[kidney_anatomy_and_function | kidney]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The term "renal" refers to the [[kidney_anatomy_and_function | kidney]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **Renal Medulla** This is the inner, middle part of the [[kidney_anatomy_and_function | kidney]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. These regions play a significant role in the filtration and excretion processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

## The Nephron: Functional Unit of Filtration
The [[the_nephron_structure | nephron]] is considered the functional unit of the [[kidney_anatomy_and_function | kidney]] because it is where the two major functions—waste excretion and water level maintenance—occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

### Initial Filtration: Glomerulus and Bowman's Capsule
Filtration begins with blood entering the [[the_nephron_structure | nephron]] through the afferent arteriole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. This arteriole leads into a highly coiled capillary network called the glomerulus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. Blood then exits via the efferent arteriole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

The presence of an arterial system (not venous) at this point is crucial because arterial systems have higher blood pressure, which is necessary to "squeeze" fluid and dissolved substances out of the blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

#### The Filtration Process
1.  **Glomerulus Porosity**: The glomerulus is very porous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
2.  **Bowman's Capsule and Podocytes**: The glomerulus is surrounded by a structure called the Bowman's capsule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>, which contains a space known as the Bowman's space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Specialized cells called podocytes, which line the Bowman's capsule, surround the glomerulus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:11]</a>. These podocytes add selectivity to what gets filtered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
3.  **Filtrate Formation**: Due to high blood pressure, approximately one-fifth of the fluid entering the glomerulus is squeezed out and enters the Bowman's space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:20]</a>. This expelled fluid is called "filtrate" or "glomerular filtrate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, and it is not yet considered urine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

#### What is Filtered (and What Isn't)
*   **Filtered**: Small ions (like sodium), small molecules such as glucose and amino acids, and water are easily dissolved in the fluid and pass into the filtrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:21]</a>.
*   **Not Filtered**: Larger components like red blood cells and large proteins do not get filtered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:31]</a>.

### Beyond Initial Filtration: Reabsorption and Concentration
The filtrate then proceeds through various parts of the [[the_nephron_structure | nephron]] where significant [[reabsorption_process_in_the_nephron | reabsorption]] and concentration occur to prevent the loss of essential substances and excessive water.

#### Proximal Tubule
After the Bowman's capsule, the filtrate enters the proximal tubule, which is a convoluted tube near the beginning of the [[the_nephron_structure | nephron]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:23]</a>. The primary role of the proximal tubule is to begin [[reabsorption_process_in_the_nephron | reabsorbing]] substances the body does not want to lose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:09]</a>. This includes:
*   Glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>
*   Sodium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:18]</a>
*   Amino acids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:26]</a>
*   A significant amount of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:34]</a>

This [[reabsorption_process_in_the_nephron | reabsorption]] is an active process, meaning it requires energy (ATP) to pump substances like sodium out of the filtrate back into the bloodstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:43]</a>.

#### Loop of Henle
The [[the_nephron_structure | nephron]] then dips into the renal medulla via the [[loop_of_henle_mechanisms | Loop of Henle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. The [[loop_of_henle_mechanisms | Loop of Henle]] extends across the border between the renal cortex and the renal medulla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:24]</a>.

The [[loop_of_henle_mechanisms | Loop of Henle]] has two main purposes:
1.  **Making the Medulla Salty**: The ascending part of the [[loop_of_henle_mechanisms | Loop of Henle]] actively pumps out salts (sodium, potassium, chlorine ions) into the surrounding renal medulla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:13:17]</a>. This process requires ATP and works against the [[role_of_concentration_gradients_in_diffusion_and_osmosis | concentration gradient]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:41]</a>. This makes the medulla highly concentrated or "hypertonic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:29]</a>. The ascending limb is permeable to salts but not to water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:14:06]</a>.
2.  **Water Reabsorption**: The descending part of the [[loop_of_henle_mechanisms | Loop of Henle]] is permeable only to water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:13]</a>. Because the surrounding medulla is salty (hypertonic), water naturally leaves the descending limb via [[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | osmosis]] to balance the concentrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:44]</a>. This is a major mechanism for reclaiming large amounts of water filtered initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:48]</a>. Biological systems cannot actively pump water, so making the environment salty and allowing water to flow out passively is an efficient solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:14]</a>.

#### Distal Convoluted Tubule and Collecting Ducts
After the [[loop_of_henle_mechanisms | Loop of Henle]], the filtrate enters the distal convoluted tubule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>. Here, more [[reabsorption_process_in_the_nephron | reabsorption]] of substances like calcium and sodium occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:28]</a>, along with some additional water reabsorption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:39]</a>.

Finally, the processed filtrate, now much more concentrated and consisting mainly of waste products and excess water, is dumped into collecting ducts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:17:05]</a>. Multiple [[the_nephron_structure | nephrons]] empty into these ducts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:13]</a>. The collecting ducts also pass back through the salty renal medulla, allowing for further water reabsorption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:34]</a>. The porosity of the collecting duct can be regulated by hormones like anti-diuretic hormone, which dictates how much more water leaves the filtrate, making the urine even more concentrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:18:17]</a>.

Once the filtrate has been thoroughly processed and concentrated, it is considered urine. It then leaves the [[kidney_anatomy_and_function | kidney]] via the ureters and travels to the urinary bladder for excretion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:23]</a>.

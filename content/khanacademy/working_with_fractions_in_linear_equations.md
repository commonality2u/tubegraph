When [[understanding_linear_equations|solving linear equations]], particularly those involving fractions as coefficients, a systematic approach is crucial. This method involves multiplying by the reciprocal of the fractional coefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Basic Principles of Solving Linear Equations

A linear equation can be conceptualized as finding a missing number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. For instance, the expression `5x = 20` means "5 times what number equals 20?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. In algebra, when a number is written directly next to a variable, it implies multiplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This concept is fundamental to [[solving_simple_linear_equations|solving simple linear equations]].

There are two primary methods for isolating the variable:
1.  **Dividing by the coefficient:** To solve `5x = 20`, you can divide both sides of the equation by 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This cancels out the 5 on the left side, leaving `x = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
2.  **Multiplying by the reciprocal:** Alternatively, you can multiply both sides of `5x = 20` by 1/5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Multiplying by 1/5 is mathematically identical to dividing by 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This also results in `x = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

The latter method, multiplying by the reciprocal, is often preferred when dealing with fractional coefficients because it simplifies the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Solving Equations with Fractional Coefficients

When the coefficient of the variable `x` is a fraction, the most efficient method is to multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of that fraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. The *coefficient* is the number being multiplied by `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Notation for Multiplication
> In algebra, a dot (e.g., `5 ⋅ x`) or simply writing a number next to a variable (e.g., `5x`) implies multiplication, as the traditional multiplication sign (`x`) can be confused with the variable `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Writing a number next to parentheses also implies multiplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

### Example 1: Solving with a Negative Fractional Coefficient

Consider the equation:
`(-3/4)x = 10/13` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>

1.  **Identify the reciprocal:** The reciprocal of -3/4 is -4/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
2.  **Multiply both sides by the reciprocal:**
    `(-4/3) ⋅ (-3/4)x = (10/13) ⋅ (-4/3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>
3.  **Simplify:**
    On the left side, (-4/3) and (-3/4) cancel out to 1, leaving `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
    On the right side, perform the [[multiplying_fractions|multiplication]]:
    `x = (10 * -4) / (13 * 3)`
    `x = -40/39` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>
    It's often easier to leave fractions as improper fractions rather than converting them to mixed numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

### Example 2: Another Negative Fractional Coefficient

Let's solve:
`(-5/6)x = 7/8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>

1.  **Identify the reciprocal:** The reciprocal of -5/6 is -6/5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
2.  **Multiply both sides by the reciprocal:**
    `(-6/5) ⋅ (-5/6)x = (7/8) ⋅ (-6/5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>
3.  **Simplify:**
    The left side simplifies to `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
    For the right side, before multiplying, you can [[simplifying_fractions|simplify]] by dividing common factors in the numerator and denominator. Here, 6 and 8 can both be divided by 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>:
    `x = (7/ (8/2)) ⋅ ((-6)/2 / 5)`
    `x = (7/4) ⋅ (-3/5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>
    `x = (7 * -3) / (4 * 5)`
    `x = -21/20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>

## Verifying Solutions

A significant advantage of algebra is the ability to check your answer by substituting it back into the original equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

### Verification of Example 1

Original equation: `(-3/4)x = 10/13` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>
Our solution: `x = -40/39`

Substitute `x` back into the equation:
`(-3/4) ⋅ (-40/39) = 10/13` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>

To [[multiplying_fractions|multiply fractions]], we can cross-simplify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>:
*   Divide 40 (numerator) and 4 (denominator) by 4: -40 becomes -10, 4 becomes 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   The expression becomes: `(-3/1) ⋅ (-10/39)`
*   Divide 3 (numerator) and 39 (denominator) by 3: -3 becomes -1, 39 becomes 13.
*   The expression becomes: `(-1/1) ⋅ (-10/13)`
*   Multiply the remaining terms: `(-1) * (-10) = 10`, and `1 * 13 = 13`.
*   Result: `10/13` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

Since `10/13` equals `10/13`, the solution is correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

### Verification of Example 2

Original equation: `(-5/6)x = 7/8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>
Our solution: `x = -21/20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>

Substitute `x` back into the equation:
`(-5/6) ⋅ (-21/20) = 7/8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>

Cross-simplify:
*   Divide 5 (numerator) and 20 (denominator) by 5: 5 becomes 1, 20 becomes 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
*   Divide 6 (denominator) and 21 (numerator) by 3: 6 becomes 2, 21 becomes 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
*   The expression becomes: `(-1/2) ⋅ (-7/4)`
*   Multiply the remaining terms: `(-1) * (-7) = 7`, and `2 * 4 = 8`.
*   Result: `7/8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

Since `7/8` equals `7/8`, the solution is correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

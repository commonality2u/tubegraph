## Ongoing Funding Needs

Despite substantial donations like [[elon_musk_donation_to_khan_academys_growth | Elon Musk's]], [[khan_academy_and_online_education | Khan Academy]] was running at a deficit for 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, highlighting the continuous need for funding to support its operations and growth. The organization emphasizes that every donation, regardless of size, contributes to accelerating learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

The global spending on education is approximately five trillion dollars annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. In contrast, [[khan_academy_and_online_education | Khan Academy]]'s budget is a mere one one-hundred-thousandth of that, comparable to the budget of a large high school, even though its aspirations are to serve the entire globe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. This disparity underscores the [[tradeoffs_in_resource_allocation | immense leverage]] that philanthropic investment in organizations like [[khan_academy_and_online_education | Khan Academy]] can provide for [[global_education_and_accessibility | global education and accessibility]].

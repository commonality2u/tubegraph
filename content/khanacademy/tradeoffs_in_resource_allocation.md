From: [[khanacademy]] <br/> 

The concept of tradeoffs in resource allocation explores how individuals or entities decide to divide their limited resources, such as time, among different productive activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This involves understanding the various scenarios and the compromises inherent in each choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Hunter-Gatherer Example

Consider a hypothetical hunter-gatherer who must decide how much time to spend hunting rabbits and how much time to spend gathering berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For simplicity, it is assumed that only rabbits can be hunted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a> and only berries can be gathered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

### Ceteris Paribus

When analyzing these scenarios, it is crucial to assume that [[ceteris_paribus_in_economics | everything else is equal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This Latin term literally means "all other things equal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
It implies that factors such as the total time available, sleep duration, hunting or gathering techniques, and tools remain unchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. The only variable changing is the allocation of time between hunting rabbits and gathering berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### Production Scenarios

Based on the hunter-gatherer's time allocation, different combinations of rabbits and berries can be obtained:

| Scenario | Rabbits (Average Daily) | Berries (Average Daily) |
| :------- | :---------------------- | :---------------------- |
| A        | 5                       | 0                       |
| B        | 4                       | 100                     |
| C        | 3                       | 180                     |
| D        | 2                       | 240                     |
| E        | 1                       | 280                     |
| F        | 0                       | 300                     |
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>

## The Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF)

When these scenarios are plotted on a graph with rabbits on one axis and berries on the other, connecting these points reveals the [[production_possibilities_frontier | Production Possibilities Frontier]] (PPF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. This curve illustrates all the possible combinations of rabbits and berries that can be produced given the available resources and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

### Interpreting the PPF

*   **Impossible Points**: Any point lying outside or to the right of the [[production_possibilities_frontier | PPF]] represents a combination of goods that is currently impossible to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. For example, obtaining 5 rabbits and 200 berries simultaneously is impossible because spending all time on rabbits leaves no time for berries, and vice-versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

*   **Possible but Inefficient Points**: Points lying inside or to the left of the [[production_possibilities_frontier | PPF]] are possible outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. However, they are not [[efficient_versus_inefficient_resource_use | efficient]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. This means that resources are not being used in an [[understanding_optimal_production | optimal]] way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. If the hunter-gatherer were to improve their work methods or focus, they could produce more of one or both goods without sacrificing the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

*   **Efficient Points**: All points directly on the [[production_possibilities_frontier | PPF]] itself represent [[efficient_versus_inefficient_resource_use | efficient]] production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. At these points, the hunter-gatherer is making the most productive use of their time and resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. While some combinations might be preferred over others (e.g., more berries), every point on the frontier signifies that the maximum possible output is being achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

Resource allocation involves making decisions about how to best use limited resources, often requiring [[understanding_ratios | tradeoffs]] between different possible outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This concept is fundamental to understanding [[graphing_and_interpreting_production_possibilities | production possibilities]] and [[efficiency_in_production | efficiency]] in economic systems.

## The Hunter-Gatherer Example

Consider a hunter-gatherer who must decide how to allocate their time between hunting and gathering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For simplicity, assume the only animal to hunt is rabbits and the only item to gather is berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

### The Ceteris Paribus Assumption

When analyzing these scenarios, it's crucial to assume that all other factors remain constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This principle is known as [[ceteris_paribus_in_economic_analysis | ceteris paribus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. It means that variables such as the amount of time available for hunting or gathering, sleep, hunting techniques, or gathering methods are not changing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. The only variable changing is the allocation of time between finding rabbits and finding berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### Possible Scenarios

By allocating time differently, various combinations of rabbits and berries can be obtained. Here are six possible scenarios (on average, per day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>:

| Scenario | Number of Rabbits | Number of Berries |
| :------- | :---------------- | :---------------- |
| A        | 5                 | 0                 |
| B        | 4                 | 100               |
| C        | 3                 | 180               |
| D        | 2                 | 240               |
| E        | 1                 | 280               |
| F        | 0                 | 300               |

*   **Scenario A:** If all available time is spent hunting, 5 rabbits can be obtained, but no berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Scenario F:** Conversely, if all time is spent gathering, 300 berries can be collected, but no rabbits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

## The [[production_possibilities_frontier | Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF)]]

These scenarios can be plotted on a graph with one good (e.g., rabbits) on the Y-axis and the other (e.g., berries) on the X-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/example_graph.png" alt="Graph showing a curve with rabbits on the Y-axis and berries on the X-axis, with points A-F marked on the curve, a point inside marked 'possible but not efficient', and a point outside marked 'impossible'.">

Connecting these points creates a curve known as the [[production_possibilities_frontier | production possibilities frontier]] (PPF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. This curve represents all the possible combinations of goods that can be produced when resources are used efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Any point on this curve signifies that the individual is doing the most they can do with their available time and resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

### Interpreting the PPF

*   **Points on the frontier:** These points (A through F) represent **efficient** production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. They indicate the maximum output of one good given the output of the other, assuming full and efficient use of resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

*   **Points inside the frontier:** Any point within the curve (e.g., 1 rabbit and 200 berries) is **possible** to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. However, such points indicate that resources are not being used optimally or efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. For example, if a hunter-gatherer only gets 1 rabbit and 200 berries, they could potentially get more of one or both goods by reallocating their time more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

*   **Points outside the frontier:** Any point beyond the curve (e.g., 5 rabbits and 200 berries) is **impossible** to achieve with current resources and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. This signifies a combination of goods that exceeds the productive capacity of the hunter-gatherer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

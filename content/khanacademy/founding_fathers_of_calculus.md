The development of calculus is largely attributed to two prominent figures: Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz, who are considered its founding fathers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. They conducted most of their major work in the late 1600s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Key Figures

*   **Isaac Newton**
    *   A highly famous British mathematician and physicist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.
    *   He originally referred to differential calculus as the "method of fluxions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Gottfried Leibniz**
    *   A famous German philosopher and mathematician <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
    *   He was a contemporary of Isaac Newton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Core Concept of Differential Calculus

Both Newton and Leibniz were focused on the same fundamental question: what is the instantaneous rate of change of something? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a> This is the central question that differential calculus addresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Differential calculus is all about instantaneous rates of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Instantaneous vs. Average Rate of Change

To illustrate, consider the speed of a sprinter like Usain Bolt:
*   **Average Speed**: Using [[the_fundamental_role_of_algebra_in_mathematics | traditional algebra]], one can calculate average speed by dividing the total change in distance (change in 'y') by the total change in time (change in 'x') <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This is equivalent to finding the slope between two points on a distance-time graph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. For example, Usain Bolt's average speed over 100 meters in 9.58 seconds is approximately 10.4 meters per second, or 23.5 miles per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   **Instantaneous Speed**: Unlike average speed, instantaneous speed asks, "How fast is he going right now?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Because an object like a sprinter accelerates and decelerates, their speed changes constantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Traditional [[the_fundamental_role_of_algebra_in_mathematics | algebra]] struggles to determine this instantaneous rate because the slope of a distance-time curve is constantly changing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Usain Bolt's peak instantaneous velocity, for instance, is closer to 30 miles per hour, higher than his average speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

## Calculus Terminology

To find the instantaneous rate of change, calculus employs key concepts:
*   **[[understanding_the_concept_of_limits_in_calculus | Limits]]**: Instead of calculating the slope over a defined interval (Δx), calculus considers what happens as the change in 'x' (Δx) becomes infinitesimally small, approaching zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. The limit as Δx approaches 0 of Δy/Δx yields the instantaneous rate of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   **[[derivatives_and_calculus_terminology | Derivatives]]**: The instantaneous slope at a point on a curve, or the slope of the tangent line at that point, is known as the [[derivatives_and_calculus_terminology | derivative]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. The notation for a [[derivatives_and_calculus_terminology | derivative]] is `dy/dx` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
*   **Differentials**: In `dy/dx`, `dy` and `dx` are considered differentials, representing an infinitely small change in 'y' and an infinitely small change in 'x' respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. By considering these super small changes, calculus can determine instantaneous slopes and rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

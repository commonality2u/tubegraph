Meiosis is a cellular process that produces gametes (sex cells) and differs significantly from [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Unlike mitosis, which is a cycle where cells can continue to divide, meiosis is not a cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. The cells produced by meiosis, known as gametes, are specialized for fertilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

### Starting Point

The process of meiosis begins with a cell that has a diploid number of chromosomes (2n) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. For human beings, this means the starting cell contains 46 chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Similar to the preparation for mitosis, the cell undergoes interphase, during which its DNA is replicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

### [[phases_of_meiosis | Meiosis One]]

After DNA replication, the cell proceeds into Meiosis One <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. In this phase, the cell divides, resulting in two cells, each with a haploid number of chromosomes (n) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. This means that for humans, the original 46 chromosomes are distributed such that each new cell receives 23 chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Meiosis One is characterized by the splitting of [[role_of_homologous_pairs_in_meiosis | homologous pairs]] of chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. The distribution of these chromosomes, which originated from either the mother or the father, is random <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

### [[phases_of_meiosis | Meiosis Two]]

Following Meiosis One, each of the two haploid cells undergoes Meiosis Two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Meiosis Two is similar to mitosis, but it occurs in cells that already possess a haploid chromosome number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. This division results in a total of four cells from the original parent cell, each still maintaining a haploid number of chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Crucially, these four resulting cells do not all necessarily contain identical genetic information due to the chromosomal rearrangements in Meiosis One <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

### End Products and Purpose

The four haploid cells produced at the end of meiosis are called gametes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. These cells are also referred to as sex cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Their primary function is in fertilization, which is essential for sexual reproduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. For instance, in males, these are sperm cells, and in females, they are egg cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. When these gametes fuse during fertilization, they form a fertilized egg (zygote), which then undergoes [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]] to develop into a new organism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

### Location in the Body

Meiosis occurs specifically in germ cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. In males, this process takes place in the testes, producing sperm cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. In females, meiosis occurs in the ovaries, leading to the formation of egg cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Germ cells themselves are capable of undergoing [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]] to produce more diploid germ cells, or they can undergo meiosis to produce haploid gametes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

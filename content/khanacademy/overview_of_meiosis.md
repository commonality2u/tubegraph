[[overview_of_meiosis | Meiosis]] is a cellular division process that ultimately results in the production of sex cells, or gametes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. It differs significantly from [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]], which is responsible for the growth of most body cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Comparison with Mitosis

To understand [[overview_of_meiosis | meiosis]], it's helpful to first briefly recall [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]]:
*   **[[overview_of_mitosis | Mitosis]]**: Starts with a cell containing a diploid number of chromosomes (2n), such as 46 chromosomes in humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. After the process, it yields two cells, each with the same diploid genetic information as the original cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. These cells can then undergo the cell cycle again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## The Process of Meiosis

[[overview_of_meiosis | Meiosis]] is a two-phase process that begins with a diploid cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, which, like in [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]], replicates its DNA during interphase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

### Meiosis One
The first phase, [[stages_and_process_of_meiosis | Meiosis One]], transforms a diploid cell into two haploid cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. For human cells starting with 46 chromosomes, these new cells will each contain 23 chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This reduction occurs because [[stages_and_process_of_meiosis | Meiosis One]] involves splitting the homologous pairs of chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. The distribution of chromosomes from the original paternal and maternal sets into the new cells is random <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

### Meiosis Two
Following [[stages_and_process_of_meiosis | Meiosis One]], each of the two haploid cells undergoes [[stages_and_process_of_meiosis | Meiosis Two]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. This phase is quite similar to [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]], but it starts with cells that already have a haploid number of chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. The result is four cells, each containing a haploid number of chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. These four cells do not necessarily have identical genetic information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

## Purpose and Location

Unlike [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]], [[overview_of_meiosis | meiosis]] is not a continuous cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. The four haploid cells produced are [[role_of_gametes_in_sexual_reproduction | gametes]], or sex cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

These [[role_of_gametes_in_sexual_reproduction | gametes]] are essential for [[role_of_meiosis_in_sexual_reproduction | sexual reproduction]]:
*   In males, [[overview_of_meiosis | meiosis]] occurs in the testes to produce sperm cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   In females, it occurs in the ovaries to produce egg cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   These [[role_of_gametes_in_sexual_reproduction | gametes]] fuse during fertilization to form a fertilized egg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>, which can then undergo [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]] to develop into a new organism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

[[overview_of_meiosis | Meiosis]] takes place specifically in germ cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Germ cells themselves are diploid and can undergo [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]] to produce more germ cells, or they can undergo [[overview_of_meiosis | meiosis]] to produce haploid gametes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

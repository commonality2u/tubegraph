Meiosis is a specialized cell division process that results in four haploid cells, known as gametes, from a single diploid germ cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:19">01:00:19</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">02:22:00</a>. Unlike [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]], where cells simply duplicate, meiosis involves two rounds of division, meiosis I and meiosis II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">01:24:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">01:28:00</a>. The behavior and separation of homologous chromosome pairs are central to the unique outcomes of meiosis, particularly in generating genetic variation.

## Interphase: Preparation for Meiosis

Before meiosis begins, during a period called interphase (specifically the S phase), the cell's DNA replicates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">02:49:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">03:00:00</a>. Although chromosomes are typically unwound as chromatin during interphase, they are drawn in their condensed form to illustrate replication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">03:15:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">03:22:00</a>.

During this S phase, each chromosome duplicates to form two sister chromatids, which remain connected by a centromere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">04:48:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">04:54:00</a>. For instance, a chromosome inherited from the father and its homologous counterpart from the mother will both replicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">03:54:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">04:18:00</a>. Homologous chromosomes are not identical but code for the same genes, potentially with different versions (alleles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">04:34:00</a>.

## Meiosis I: Separation of Homologous Pairs

Meiosis I involves four [[phases_of_meiosis | phases]]: prophase I, metaphase I, anaphase I, and telophase I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">06:33:00</a>.

### Prophase I
In prophase I, the nuclear envelope starts to disappear, and chromosomes begin to condense from chromatin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">07:29:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">08:40:00</a>. A unique and crucial event in meiosis, not seen in [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]], is the pairing and alignment of homologous chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">08:50:00</a>. These homologous pairs then undergo [[genetic_recombination_and_crossing_over | genetic recombination]] or crossing over, where analogous points on the chromosomes exchange genetic material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">09:37:00</a>. This process generates new combinations of alleles on the chromosomes, significantly increasing genetic variation in the resulting gametes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">11:07:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:00">11:33:00</a>.

### Metaphase I
During metaphase I, the homologous pairs, now with exchanged segments from [[genetic_recombination_and_crossing_over | crossing over]], align at the cell's metaphase plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">15:00:00</a>. The orientation of each pair is random, meaning chromosomes inherited from the father or mother can end up on either side of the plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:00">14:15:00</a>. This random assortment further contributes to genetic variation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">14:17:00</a>.

### Anaphase I
In anaphase I, the homologous chromosomes are pulled apart towards opposite poles of the cell by spindle fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:08:00">15:08:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22:00">15:22:00</a>. Importantly, the sister chromatids remain attached at their centromeres, meaning each pole receives one chromosome from each homologous pair, still composed of two chromatids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:28:00">15:28:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:00">16:03:00</a>. This is a key [[differences_between_mitosis_and_meiosis | difference from mitosis]], where sister chromatids separate in anaphase.

### Telophase I
Telophase I involves the migration of homologous chromosomes to the cell poles, followed by the disassembly of microtubules and the formation of new nuclear envelopes around the segregated chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:48:00">16:48:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:15:00">17:15:00</a>. Cytokinesis occurs, dividing the cytoplasm and resulting in two haploid cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:29:00">17:29:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:52:00">17:52:00</a>. Each of these cells now contains half the number of chromosomes of the original diploid cell, with each chromosome still consisting of two sister chromatids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">01:41:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">01:52:00</a>.

## Meiosis II: Separation of Sister Chromatids

Each of the two haploid cells from meiosis I then undergoes meiosis II, which is very similar to [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">02:06:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">02:22:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">02:29:00</a>. This stage also has its own prophase II, metaphase II, anaphase II, and telophase II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">06:43:00</a>.

### Prophase II
The nuclear envelope disintegrates, and centrosomes move to opposite poles, forming new spindle fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:47:00">19:47:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:06:00">20:06:00</a>.

### Metaphase II
Chromosomes (each still composed of two sister chromatids) align individually at the metaphase plate in each of the two cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:42:00">20:42:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:29:00">21:29:00</a>.

### Anaphase II
The sister chromatids of each chromosome finally separate and are pulled to opposite poles, effectively becoming individual chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:17:00">22:17:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:51:00">22:51:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:43:00">23:43:00</a>. This step is analogous to anaphase in [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:51:00">22:51:00</a>.

### Telophase II
The cells elongate, nuclear envelopes reform around the separated chromosomes at each pole, and cytokinesis divides the cytoplasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:49:00">24:49:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:11:00">25:11:00</a>. This results in a total of four unique haploid cells, each containing half the number of chromosomes of the original parent cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">02:22:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">02:26:00</a>. These final haploid cells are known as gametes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">01:02:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">02:32:00</a>.

## Significance of Homologous Pair Behavior
The distinct behavior of homologous pairs in meiosis I—their pairing, [[genetic_recombination_and_crossing_over | crossing over]], and subsequent separation—is fundamental to the genetic diversity seen in sexually reproducing organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:52:00">26:52:00</a>. This variation is further enhanced by the random assortment of homologous chromosomes during metaphase I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">01:18:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">01:52:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">01:20:00</a>.

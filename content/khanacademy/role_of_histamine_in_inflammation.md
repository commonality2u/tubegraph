Histamine is a crucial chemical mediator in the body's [[inflammatory_response_overview | inflammatory response]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. It is a primary "main actor" in this initial defense mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

## Release and Activation
Histamine is released by mast cells, which are immune cells often found in tissues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Mast cells can be activated by various stimuli, including:
*   Direct contact with an invading foreign object (e.g., a nail) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>
*   Chemokines, which are chemical messengers released by damaged cells in the affected area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>
*   Molecules or byproducts released by bacteria or viruses that have entered the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>

## Effects on Capillaries
One of the primary actions of histamine is on the endothelial cells that line the capillaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. When histamine reaches these cells, it causes them to:
1.  **Separate and Enlarge Capillaries:** Histamine causes the endothelial cells to pull apart from each other, making the actual capillaries larger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. This process is known as [[vasodilation_and_capillary_permeability | vasodilation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
2.  **Increase Porosity:** The capillary walls become more porous, allowing substances that normally wouldn't pass through easily to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

## Contribution to Inflammatory Symptoms
The effects of histamine contribute directly to the macroscopic symptoms observed during inflammation:
*   **Swelling (Edema):** The enlargement and increased porosity of capillaries due to [[vasodilation_and_capillary_permeability | vasodilation]] cause more fluid to collect in the affected area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. This fluid, called exudate, leads to noticeable swelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>.
*   **Redness and Heat:** Increased blood flow to the dilated capillaries contributes to redness and warmth in the affected area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.
*   **Facilitates Immune Cell Recruitment:** The increased porosity allows immune cells, particularly phagocytes like [[role_of_neutrophils_and_other_white_blood_cells | neutrophils]], to squeeze through the capillary walls and reach the site of infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. This process is vital for the immune response, as these cells are needed to engulf pathogens and damaged cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

## Clinical Relevance
Antihistamines, commonly taken during cold season or for allergies, work by trying to shut down the [[inflammatory_response_overview | inflammatory response]] by blocking histamine's effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. While this can alleviate symptoms like a runny or stuffy nose, it raises the question of whether suppressing the body's first line of defense is always beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

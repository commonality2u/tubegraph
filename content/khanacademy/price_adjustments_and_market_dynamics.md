In [[Microeconomics and macroeconomics | economics]], understanding how [[consumer_and_producer_behavior_in_response_to_price_changes | consumers and producers]] respond to price changes is crucial for analyzing market dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This analysis often involves plotting [[supply_and_demand_curves | supply and demand curves]] on a graph where the vertical axis represents price per pound and the horizontal axis represents quantity (e.g., thousands of pounds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## The [[demand_schedule_and_demand_curve | Demand Curve]]

The demand curve illustrates the relationship between the price of a good and the [[effects_of_price_changes_on_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] by consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. When the price of apples is very high (e.g., $5 a pound), the [[effects_of_price_changes_on_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] by consumers will be low (e.g., 500 pounds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Conversely, if the price is low (e.g., $1 a pound), the [[effects_of_price_changes_on_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] will be high (e.g., 4,000 pounds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This inverse relationship typically results in a downward-sloping demand curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

It's important to distinguish between [[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | demand]] and [[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]]:
*   **[[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | Quantity demanded]]** refers to the specific amount consumers are willing and able to buy at a particular price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **[[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | Demand]]** represents the entire relationship between various prices and the quantities consumers are willing to buy at each of those prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## The Supply Curve

The supply curve illustrates the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity producers are willing to supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. There is a certain price below which producers are not willing to produce at all (e.g., 50 cents) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. As the price increases, the quantity producers are willing to supply also increases, resulting in an upward-sloping supply curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This curve represents the collective behavior of all suppliers in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## Market Imbalances: Shortages and Surpluses

When the market is not at [[Equilibrium price and quantity | equilibrium]], it experiences either a [[market_shortages_and_surpluses | shortage]] or a [[market_shortages_and_surpluses | surplus]].

### Shortage
A [[market_shortages_and_surpluses | shortage]] occurs when the price is set too low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. For example, if apples are priced at $1 per pound:
*   The [[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | quantity supplied]] is 1,000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   The [[effects_of_price_changes_on_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] is 4,000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   This results in a [[market_shortages_and_surpluses | shortage]] of 3,000 pounds of apples (4,000 demanded - 1,000 supplied) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

In a [[market_shortages_and_surpluses | shortage]] situation, consumers will bid up prices due to high demand, causing prices to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. As prices increase, producers are incentivized to increase the [[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | quantity supplied]], moving up their supply curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Simultaneously, higher prices cause consumers to demand less, moving up their demand curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

### Surplus
A [[market_shortages_and_surpluses | surplus]] occurs when the price is set too high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. For instance, if apples are priced at $3 per pound:
*   The [[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | quantity supplied]] is 3,000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   The [[effects_of_price_changes_on_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] is 1,300 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
*   This creates a [[market_shortages_and_surpluses | surplus]] of 1,700 pounds of apples (3,000 supplied - 1,300 demanded) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

In a [[market_shortages_and_surpluses | surplus]] situation, producers, facing unsold goods, will reduce prices to attract buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. As prices decrease, producers will also reduce the [[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | quantity supplied]], moving down their supply curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Lower prices encourage consumers to demand more, moving down their demand curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

## [[Equilibrium price and quantity | Equilibrium Price and Quantity]]

Both [[market_shortages_and_surpluses | shortages]] and [[market_shortages_and_surpluses | surpluses]] naturally push the market toward a specific point where the [[supply_and_demand_curves | supply and demand curves]] intersect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This intersection point represents the [[Equilibrium price and quantity | equilibrium price]] and [[Equilibrium price and quantity | equilibrium quantity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

*   The **[[Equilibrium price and quantity | equilibrium price]]** (e.g., $2.15 per pound) is the price at which the [[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | quantity supplied]] equals the [[effects_of_price_changes_on_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   The **[[Equilibrium price and quantity | equilibrium quantity]]** (e.g., 2,200 pounds) is the specific quantity at which [[demand_vs_quantity_demanded | quantity supplied]] equals [[effects_of_price_changes_on_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] at the [[Equilibrium price and quantity | equilibrium price]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

At [[Equilibrium price and quantity | equilibrium]], the market is stable: all goods produced are sold, and there are no unsatisfied buyers or excess stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. This represents a favorable scenario for both [[consumer_and_producer_behavior_in_response_to_price_changes | consumers and producers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

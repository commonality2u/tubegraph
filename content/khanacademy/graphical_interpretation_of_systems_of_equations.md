When considering [[understanding_systems_of_equations | systems of equations]], their solutions can be understood through a [[visual_representation_of_equations | graphical]] lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Solutions as Intersections
If a system involves two linear equations, each equation represents a line when [[graphing_equations | graphed]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The solution to such a system corresponds to the point where these lines intersect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This intersection point represents the specific x and y values that satisfy both equations simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

For example, when solving a system of two linear equations, the final x and y values determined (e.g., x = 7/2, y = -2) are the coordinates of this intersection point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

While [[methods_for_solving_systems_of_equations | methods for solving systems of equations]] like substitution and elimination are often used for precision, [[graphing_equations | graphing]] can also be employed, though it might be less precise for exact values as "eyeballing" the intersection can be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

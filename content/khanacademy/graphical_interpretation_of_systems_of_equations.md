## Graphical Interpretation of Systems of Equations

When considering a [[introduction_to_systems_of_equations | system of equations]], especially [[linear_equations_representation | linear equations]], the solution can be understood through their graphical representation.

### Intersection of Lines
Graphically, the solution to a [[introduction_to_systems_of_equations | system of equations]] represents the [[graphing_linear_equations | intersection]] of the lines that depict the solution sets for each individual [[linear_equations_representation | equation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This means that if you were to plot each [[linear_equations_representation | equation]] as a line on a coordinate plane, the point where these lines cross is the unique (x, y) value that satisfies both [[linear_equations_representation | equations]] simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This common (x, y) value is the coordinate of their [[graphing_linear_equations | intersection]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

While methods like [[solving_systems_of_equations_using_elimination | substitution]] or [[solving_systems_of_equations_using_elimination | elimination]] are effective for [[systematic_approach_to_solving_equations | solving]] [[introduction_to_systems_of_equations | systems of equations]], [[graphing_linear_equations | graphing]] can also be used, though it might be less precise for finding exact solutions, particularly with decimal values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

## Introduction to Logarithms

A logarithm is a mathematical operation that represents the [[inverse_relationship_between_logarithms_and_exponents | inverse of taking the exponent]] of something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The word "logarithm" is often shortened to "log" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

To understand logarithms, consider an exponential expression:
If 2 to the third power is equal to 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, this can be written in [[Logarithm notation and conversion | logarithm notation]] as:
`log base 2 of 8 is equal to 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

This means asking "2 to what power equals 8?" The answer is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. The result of [[Evaluating logarithmic expressions | evaluating a logarithm expression]] is the exponent that the base would be raised to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

For example, if you want to find `log base 4 of 64` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, you are essentially asking "4 to what power is equal to 64?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Since 4 to the third power is 64 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, `log base 4 of 64` equals 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

## Logarithms Involving Fractions

Logarithms can involve fractional bases or results. To [[Calculating logarithms with examples | calculate]] `log base 1/2 of 1/8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>, we can set it equal to `x`:
`log base 1/2 of 1/8 = x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>

This can be rewritten in exponential form as:
`(1/2) to the x power is equal to 1/8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>

Since we know that 1/2 raised to the third power equals 1/8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>:
`(1/2)^3 = 1/8`

Therefore, `log base 1/2 of 1/8` is equal to 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

## Logarithms and Negative Exponents

Logarithms can also result in negative exponents, particularly when dealing with fractions that are powers of the base. For example, to find `log base 8 of 1/64` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>, we ask:
"8 to what power equals 1/64?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>

We know that `log base 8 of 64` would be 2, because 8 squared (8^2) is equal to 64 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
However, for 1/64, we need to recall rules about [[Exponents and radical notation | negative exponents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
8 to the negative 2 power (8^-2) is the same as 1 divided by 8 to the 2nd power (1/8^2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
This simplifies to 1/64 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

Therefore, `log base 8 of 1/64` is equal to -2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. When you take the inverse of the number you are taking the logarithm of, the answer turns negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Special Cases of Logarithms
> *   Any positive number (except 1) raised to the 0-th power is equal to 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. So, `log base 100 of 1` is 0, because 100^0 = 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
> *   [[Undefined logarithms and special cases | Logarithms are undefined]] if the argument (the number inside the logarithm) is 0 or negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. For instance, `log base 2 of 0` is undefined because there's no power `x` such that 2^x = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. Similarly, `log base 3 of negative 1` is undefined when dealing with real numbers, as there's no power to raise 3 to that results in a negative number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. To be defined, the number inside the logarithm must be greater than 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

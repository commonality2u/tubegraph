Learning is an inherent human capability, with everyone starting from zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Nobody is born smart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>; abilities like talking, walking, reading, riding a bike, or doing algebra are all acquired skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Initially, no one is proficient at anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. For instance, even Albert Einstein had to learn to count to ten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, and William Shakespeare learned his ABCs just like everyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This [[universality_of_learning_capability | universality of learning capability]] underscores that we are all "born to learn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## The Role of Failure in [[the_journey_of_learning | Learning]]

The [[the_journey_of_learning | learning process]] is rarely linear or effortless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. It often involves stumbling, slipping, crawling, falling, and failing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This can be a frustrating and confusing experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. However, persistent struggle eventually leads to breakthroughs, like learning to walk one foot in front of the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

Crucially, each "wrong answer" or failure actively contributes to strengthening the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This perspective highlights that "failing is just another word for growing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. [[the_learning_process_from_simple_to_complex | Complex concepts]] are built upon basic ideas, making them accessible to anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Embracing a [[growth_mindset | growth mindset]] means knowing that success will eventually be achieved, even if it hasn't happened yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The fundamental truth is that anyone, anywhere, has the capacity to learn anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

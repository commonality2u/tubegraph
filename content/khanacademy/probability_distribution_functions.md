A [[probability_distribution_and_density_functions | probability distribution function]] is a fundamental and profound concept in statistics and mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. It describes the probabilities for a [[random_variables_and_probabilities | random variable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Characteristics
[[probability_distribution_and_density_functions | Probability distribution functions]] can be either continuous or discrete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. For a distribution to be considered under the [[central_limit_theorem | Central Limit Theorem]], it must possess a well-defined mean and variance, which implies a well-defined standard deviation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Example of a Discrete Distribution
An example of a discrete [[probability_distribution_and_density_functions | probability distribution function]] might involve outcomes similar to a "crazy dice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This specific example is designed to *not* look like a [[normal_distribution | normal distribution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

In this "crazy dice" example:
*   The likelihood of rolling a '1' is very high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   It is impossible to roll a '2' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   There's an "OK" likelihood of rolling a '3' or a '4' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   It is impossible to roll a '5' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   The likelihood of rolling a '6' is very high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Role in the Central Limit Theorem
When samples are repeatedly taken from a [[random_variables_and_probabilities | random variable]] described by any [[probability_distribution_and_density_functions | probability distribution function]] (like the "crazy dice" example), and the means of these samples are calculated and plotted, the resulting distribution of these sample means will approach a [[normal_distribution | normal distribution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. This phenomenon is known as the [[central_limit_theorem | Central Limit Theorem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

This theorem is particularly useful because, in real-world scenarios, the underlying [[probability_distribution_and_density_functions | probability distribution functions]] for various processes are often unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. However, the theorem demonstrates that if multiple actions or processes are combined (e.g., by summing or averaging them), the distribution of these sums or means will tend towards a [[normal_distribution | normal distribution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. This explains why the [[normal_distribution | normal distribution]] is so prevalent and useful in statistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

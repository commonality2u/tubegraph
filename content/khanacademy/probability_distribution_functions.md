[[probability_density_functions | Probability distribution functions]] are described as fundamental and profound concepts in statistics and mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Characteristics
Any [[probability_density_functions | probability distribution function]] that possesses a well-defined mean and variance (and consequently, a well-defined standard deviation) can be either a continuous or a [[discrete_random_variables | discrete distribution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

### Discrete Example
A [[discrete_random_variables | discrete probability distribution function]] can be imagined as a "crazy dice" that can take on values from 1 through 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   It might have a very high likelihood of rolling a 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   It could be impossible to roll a 2 or a 5 (i.e., the probability for these outcomes is 0) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   There might be an "OK likelihood" of rolling a 3 or a 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   It could also be very likely to roll a 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

This example highlights that the original [[probability_density_functions | probability distribution function]] does not need to resemble a [[normal_distribution | normal distribution]] to demonstrate the power of the central limit theorem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Role in the Central Limit Theorem
The [[probability_density_functions | probability distribution function]] of an original [[random_variables | random variable]] is the starting point for understanding the central limit theorem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The theorem states that even if the original distribution is irregular or "crazy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>, the distribution of the means of samples taken from it will approximate a [[normal_distribution | normal distribution]] as the sample size increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

This principle is crucial because in many real-world scenarios, the true [[probability_density_functions | probability distribution functions]] for various processes (e.g., protein interactions, human behavior) are unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. However, the central limit theorem demonstrates that if multiple actions are summed or averaged, the frequency distribution of these sums or means will tend towards a [[normal_distribution | normal distribution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. This explains the frequent appearance of the [[normal_distribution | normal distribution]] in statistics and its utility as an approximation for the sum or mean of many processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

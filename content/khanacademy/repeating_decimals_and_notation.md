## What are Repeating Decimals?
A repeating decimal is a decimal representation of a number where one or more digits repeat infinitely after the decimal point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This occurs when a fraction is converted into a decimal and the division process results in a remainder that keeps recurring, leading to a repeating pattern of digits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## Notation for Repeating Decimals
Since an infinite number of repeating digits cannot be written out, a special notation is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. A line (also known as a vinculum) is placed on top of the digit or pattern of digits that repeats indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

For example:
*   Instead of writing 0.3333... (where the '3' goes on forever), it can be represented as 0.33 repeating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   Another common way to write 0.333... repeating is simply 0.3 repeating, with the line over just the '3' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

## Examples of Converting Fractions to Repeating Decimals

### Example 1: Converting 1/3 to a Decimal
To [[converting_fractions_to_decimals | convert a fraction into a decimal]], divide the denominator into the numerator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. For 1/3, divide 3 into 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>:
1.  Set up the division: 3 divided into 1. Add a decimal point and trailing zeros to 1 (e.g., 1.000...) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
2.  3 goes into 10 three times (3 x 3 = 9) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
3.  Subtract 9 from 10, leaving 1. Bring down the next zero to make 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
4.  The process repeats: 3 goes into 10 three times again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
5.  This pattern continues indefinitely, resulting in 0.3333... <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
Therefore, 1/3 is equal to 0.33 repeating (0.3 with a bar over the 3) or 0.33 repeating (0.33 with a bar over both 3s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

### Example 2: Converting 17/9 to a Decimal
17/9 is an improper fraction, meaning its decimal equivalent will be greater than 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
1.  Divide the denominator (9) into the numerator (17), adding trailing zeros after a decimal point for 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
2.  9 goes into 17 one time (1 x 9 = 9) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
3.  Subtract 9 from 17, leaving 8. Bring down a zero to make 80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
4.  9 goes into 80 eight times (8 x 9 = 72) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
5.  Subtract 72 from 80, leaving 8. Bring down another zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
6.  The pattern repeats: 9 goes into 80 eight times, resulting in a remainder of 8 again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
This indicates that the '8' repeats indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Thus, 17/9 is equal to 1.88 repeating (1.8 with a bar over the 8) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. While this can be rounded (e.g., to 1.89 in the hundredths place) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, the repeating decimal is the exact answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

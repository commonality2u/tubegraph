The order of a [[introduction_to_differential_equations | differential equation]] is a fundamental classification based on the highest derivative present within the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. It specifically refers to the highest derivative of the unknown function whose [[functionbased_solutions_to_differential_equations | solution]] is sought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

## Defining the Order

A [[introduction_to_differential_equations | differential equation]] involves an unknown function and its derivatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. The order of the equation is determined by identifying the highest derivative of that unknown function found anywhere in the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

For example, consider the equation:
`x^2 * y'' + x * y' + 2y = sin(x)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>

In this equation:
*   `y''` represents the second derivative of `y` with respect to `x`.
*   `y'` represents the first derivative of `y` with respect to `x`.

The highest derivative in this equation is the second derivative (`y''`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. Therefore, this equation is classified as a [[first_order_vs_higher_order_differential_equations | second-order]] [[types_of_differential_equations_ordinary_vs_partial | ordinary differential equation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

## Context of Classification

The order is one of two primary ways to classify [[types_of_differential_equations_ordinary_vs_partial | ordinary differential equations]], alongside whether they are [[classification_of_differential_equations_linear_vs_nonlinear | linear or non-linear]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

After [[glycolysis_process | glycolysis]] and the [[krebs_cycle_and_pyruvate_oxidation | Krebs cycle]], 10 NADHs and 2 FADH2s are produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. These molecules are situated in the matrix of the mitochondria and are crucial for generating ATP in the [[electron_transport_chain_and_atp_production | electron transport chain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The overall goal of the [[electron_transport_chain | electron transport chain]] is to produce ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

NADH and FADH2 play a direct role in ATP production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>:
*   Each NADH is indirectly responsible for producing approximately three ATPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   Each FADH2 is indirectly responsible for producing approximately two ATPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

The reason FADH2 yields fewer ATPs is because its electrons enter the [[electron_transport_chain | electron transport chain]] at a slightly lower energy level compared to those from NADH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

## Oxidation of NADH

The first step in the [[electron_transport_chain | electron transport chain]] involves the oxidation of NADH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Oxidation means the loss of electrons or hydrogens that carry electrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. The half-reaction for NADH oxidation is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>:
`NADH → NAD+ + H+ + 2e-` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>

The resulting NAD+ can then be reused in the [[krebs_cycle_and_pyruvate_oxidation | Krebs Cycle]] and [[glycolysis_process | glycolysis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. These two electrons released from NADH are initially at a very high energy state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

## Electron Transport and Energy Release

As these electrons move through the [[electron_transport_chain | electron transport chain]], they are passed along a series of "transition molecules" or protein complexes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. With each transfer, the electrons move into progressively lower energy states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. This transition from a higher to a lower energy state causes the release of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

### Reduction of Oxygen

The final step of the [[electron_transport_chain | electron transport chain]] involves the reduction of oxygen to water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. Reduction is the gaining of electrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. The reaction is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>:
`2e- + 2H+ + ½ O2 → H2O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>

The electrons that start in NADH eventually end up reducing oxygen into water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

## Proton Pumping and Gradient Formation

The energy released by the electrons as they move through the [[electron_transport_chain | electron transport chain]] is not directly used to make ATP, but rather to power proton pumps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. These pumps are large protein complexes embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane (cristae) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

The energy allows these proteins to pump hydrogen protons (H+) from the mitochondrial matrix into the outer compartment (intermembrane space) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. This action creates a strong electrochemical gradient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>:
*   The outer compartment becomes significantly more acidic (higher H+ concentration) than the matrix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.
*   An electrical potential forms, with the outer compartment becoming more positive due to the accumulation of positively charged protons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

This gradient represents stored potential energy, as the protons naturally want to move back into the matrix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

## ATP Synthesis via ATP Synthase

The inner mitochondrial membrane is largely impermeable to hydrogen protons, so they must pass through a specialized protein complex called ATP synthase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

As protons flow back into the matrix through ATP synthase, they drive a mechanical rotation of a part of the protein, similar to a turbine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. This mechanical energy is then used to force ADP and an inorganic phosphate (Pi) together to form ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. This process of ATP synthesis is a key part of [[electron_transport_chain_and_atp_production | ATP production]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

## Overall ATP Yield

The [[role_of_nadh_and_fadh2_in_atp_production | role of NADH and FADH2 in ATP production]] is indirect; they supply the electrons whose energy builds the proton gradient, which then powers ATP synthase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

In an ideal scenario:
*   10 NADHs (from [[glycolysis_process | glycolysis]] and [[krebs_cycle_and_pyruvate_oxidation | Krebs Cycle]]) yield approximately 30 ATPs (3 ATPs per NADH) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.
*   2 FADH2s (from [[krebs_cycle_and_pyruvate_oxidation | Krebs Cycle]]) yield approximately 4 ATPs (2 ATPs per FADH2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

Combined with the 2 net ATPs directly produced in [[glycolysis_process | glycolysis]] and 2 ATPs directly produced in the [[krebs_cycle_and_pyruvate_oxidation | Krebs Cycle]], this brings the total to a theoretical maximum of 38 ATPs per glucose molecule in cellular respiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>. It's important to note that this is an ideal yield, as some energy can be lost due to proton leakage or inefficient electron transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

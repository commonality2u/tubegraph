Area is a measure of how much space a two-dimensional figure occupies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. It can be thought of as the number of [[concept_of_area_using_1by1_squares | 1-by-1 squares]] that can fit within the boundaries of the figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. A [[concept_of_area_using_1by1_squares | 1-by-1 square]] is a square where all sides are 1 unit in length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

## Understanding Rectangles

A rectangle is a four-sided figure with four right angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. In a rectangle, opposite sides are equal in length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. When describing a rectangle, you can refer to its dimensions, for example, a "5 by 7 rectangle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

## Calculating Area

To find the area of a rectangle, you generally multiply one dimension (often called length) by the other dimension (width) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

### Example: Rectangle ABCD

Consider a rectangle ABCD where side AB is 7 units long and side BC is 5 units long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
To find the area of this rectangle, denoted as [ABCD] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>:

1.  Visualize fitting [[concept_of_area_using_1by1_squares | 1-by-1 squares]] into the rectangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
2.  Along one side (length), you can fit 7 [[concept_of_area_using_1by1_squares | 1-by-1 squares]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
3.  Along the other side (width), you can fit 5 rows of these squares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
4.  The total number of [[concept_of_area_using_1by1_squares | 1-by-1 squares]] is found by multiplying the number of squares along each dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
5.  Area = 5 rows × 7 columns = 35 [[concept_of_area_using_1by1_squares | squares]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
    *   So, the area of this rectangle is 35 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

### General Formula

For any rectangle, the area is calculated by multiplying its length by its width <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
`Area = Length × Width`

### Special Case: Squares

A square is a special type of rectangle where all four sides are equal in length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. To calculate the [[calculating_area_for_special_cases_like_squares | area of a square]], you multiply the length of one side by itself (or "square" the side length) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. For example, if a square has a side length of 2, its area is 2 × 2 = 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. You can fit 4 [[concept_of_area_using_1by1_squares | 1-by-1 squares]] into a 2-by-2 square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

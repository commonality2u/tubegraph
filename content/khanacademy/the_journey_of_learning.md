The journey of learning begins at birth, with everyone starting from a point of zero knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Newborns cannot talk, walk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, or perform complex tasks like [[introduction_to_algebra | algebra]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Initially, no one is proficient at anything, including basic skills such as adding, reading, or riding a bike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Even renowned figures like Albert Einstein once struggled to count to ten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, and William Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like everyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This highlights the [[universality_of_learning_capability | universality of learning capability]] and that intelligence is not innate but developed.

## The [[the_learning_process_from_simple_to_complex | Learning Process]]

Humans are naturally inclined to learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. [[the_learning_process_from_simple_to_complex | The process is gradual]], often involving stumbling, slipping, crawling, and frequent falling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. It can be frustrating and confusing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Despite the challenges, continuous struggle leads to progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This advancement happens one step at a time, building one idea upon the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## The [[the_importance_of_failure_in_learning | Importance of Failure]]

A crucial aspect of this journey is [[the_importance_of_failure_in_learning | embracing failure]]. Each incorrect answer contributes to strengthening the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Failure is simply another term for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This persistence, even when a concept hasn't been grasped yet, is learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Universal Learning Capability

The most intricate and beautiful concepts in the universe are founded on fundamental ideas that anyone, regardless of location or background, can understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The key takeaway for anyone is that they possess the capacity to learn anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

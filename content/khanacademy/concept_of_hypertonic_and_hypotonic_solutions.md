From: [[khanacademy]] <br/> 

The terms hypertonic and hypotonic describe the relative concentration of a [[concept_of_solutions_solvents_and_solutes | solute]] in a [[concept_of_solutions_solvents_and_solutes | solution]] compared to another [[concept_of_solutions_solvents_and_solutes | solution]] or environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. These concepts are fundamental to understanding processes like [[role_of_concentration_gradients_in_diffusion_and_osmosis | diffusion]] and [[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | osmosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

## Defining Concentration

Concentration refers to the amount of a particular particle or substance per unit of space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. For example, if you have many particles in a given space, it's a high concentration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. Conversely, if you have few particles in the same amount of space, it's a low concentration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

## Hypertonic Solutions

A **hypertonic solution** is one that has a higher concentration of [[concept_of_solutions_solvents_and_solutes | solute]] compared to another solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. The prefix "hyper-" implies having a lot or too much of something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

## Hypotonic Solutions

A **hypotonic solution** is one that has a lower concentration of [[concept_of_solutions_solvents_and_solutes | solute]] compared to another solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. The prefix "hypo-" suggests having less of something, as in "hypoglycemic" (low blood sugar) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

## Role in Diffusion

[[role_of_concentration_gradients_in_diffusion_and_osmosis | Diffusion]] is the process by which particles or molecules spread out from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>. If a [[concept_of_solutions_solvents_and_solutes | solute]] is able to move freely, it will diffuse from a hypertonic area (high [[concept_of_solutions_solvents_and_solutes | solute]] concentration) to a hypotonic area (low [[concept_of_solutions_solvents_and_solutes | solute]] concentration) until the concentrations are roughly equal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. This movement is driven by the random motion and collisions of molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

## Role in Osmosis

[[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | Osmosis]] is a specific type of [[role_of_concentration_gradients_in_diffusion_and_osmosis | diffusion]] involving the movement of a [[concept_of_solutions_solvents_and_solutes | solvent]] (typically water) across a [[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | semi-permeable membrane]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. A [[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | semi-permeable membrane]] allows certain molecules (like water) to pass through, but not others (like larger [[concept_of_solutions_solvents_and_solutes | solute]] molecules) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

In [[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | osmosis]]:
*   If a [[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | semi-permeable membrane]] separates a hypertonic solution (high [[concept_of_solutions_solvents_and_solutes | solute]] concentration) from a hypotonic solution (low [[concept_of_solutions_solvents_and_solutes | solute]] concentration), the [[concept_of_solutions_solvents_and_solutes | solvent]] (water) will move from the hypotonic side to the hypertonic side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.
*   This movement occurs because the presence of [[concept_of_solutions_solvents_and_solutes | solute]] molecules on the hypertonic side makes it statistically less likely for water molecules to exit that side, while water molecules can more easily enter from the hypotonic side where there are fewer [[concept_of_solutions_solvents_and_solutes | solute]] molecules obstructing the membrane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.
*   The net result is a flow of water into the hypertonic solution, attempting to equalize the [[role_of_concentration_gradients_in_diffusion_and_osmosis | concentration]] of the [[concept_of_solutions_solvents_and_solutes | solute]] on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.

From: [[khanacademy]] <br/> 

Mathematics, and particularly [[the_abstraction_and_generalization_in_algebra|algebra]], serves as a foundational language for understanding the universe itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. As [[significant_historical_figures_in_algebra|Galileo Galilei]] stated, "Philosophy is written in that great book which ever lies before our eyes--I mean the universe--but we cannot understand it if we do not first learn the language and grasp the symbols in which is written. This book is written in the mathematical language, without which one wanders in vain through a dark labyrinth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. This perspective highlights the profound role of mathematics in revealing the underlying structure of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>.

## From Concrete to Abstract: The Essence of Algebra

[[The_abstraction_and_generalization_in_algebra|Algebra]] is characterized by its ability to [[the_abstraction_and_generalization_in_algebra|abstract]] and generalize concepts, moving from specific examples to universal ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. These abstract concepts are fundamental and pure, underpinning various [[practical_applications_of_algebra_in_daily_life_and_science|applications]] across fields like economics, finance, physics, and chemistry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.

### Generalizing with Variables

Consider a simple scenario: calculating a discount during a store sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.
If a pair of pants costs $20 and is 30% off, the discount is calculated as 30% of $20, or 0.30 * $20, which equals $6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

To generalize this idea for *any* product in the store, [[the_abstraction_and_generalization_in_algebra|algebra]] introduces a symbol, or variable, to represent the unknown or varying quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.
*   Let `x` be the non-discounted price of a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.
*   The discount can then be expressed as `30% * x` or `0.30 * x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.
This allows for the calculation of the discount for any product price by substituting its value for `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.

Further [[the_abstraction_and_generalization_in_algebra|abstraction]] involves generalizing the percentage off itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>:
*   Let `p` represent the percentage off (as a decimal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.
*   Let `x` represent the non-discounted price of the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>.
*   Let `y` represent the dollar discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.

This leads to the general [[understanding_relationships_and_equations_in_algebra|equation]]:
`y = p * x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>.

## The Universality of Algebraic Relationships

The true power of [[the_abstraction_and_generalization_in_algebra|algebra]] lies in the universality of its [[understanding_relationships_and_equations_in_algebra|relationships]] and [[understanding_relationships_and_equations_in_algebra|equations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>. The [[understanding_relationships_and_equations_in_algebra|equation]] `y = p * x` is not confined to calculating discounts. It represents a fundamental mathematical [[understanding_relationships_and_equations_in_algebra|relationship]] that can be applied to vastly different domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>.

For example, in physics, the famous [[understanding_relationships_and_equations_in_algebra|equation]] for force is `Force = Mass * Acceleration` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>.
If we let:
*   `y` = Force
*   `p` = Mass
*   `x` = Acceleration

Then, the force [[understanding_relationships_and_equations_in_algebra|equation]] `Force = Mass * Acceleration` is mathematically equivalent to `y = p * x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>. The underlying mathematical structure is the same, despite the vastly different physical meaning of the variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.

This demonstrates that a single algebraic [[understanding_relationships_and_equations_in_algebra|equation]] can have an "infinite number of [[practical_applications_of_algebra_in_daily_life_and_science|applications]]" across economics, finance, computer science, logic, electrical engineering, and accounting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>.

## Manipulating Abstractions to Discover Truths

A key aspect of [[the_abstraction_and_generalization_in_algebra|algebra]] is the ability to manipulate these abstract [[understanding_relationships_and_equations_in_algebra|equations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>. What is discovered through these manipulations holds true for *all* its [[practical_applications_of_algebra_in_daily_life_and_science|applications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>.

Consider the [[understanding_relationships_and_equations_in_algebra|equation]] `y = p * x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>. If we want to find what `y` divided by `x` equals, we can perform the same operation on both sides of the [[understanding_the_concept_of_equality_in_algebra|equation]] to maintain [[understanding_the_concept_of_equality_in_algebra|equality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>:

`y / x = (p * x) / x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>

Since `x` divided by `x` equals 1, the `x` values on the right side cancel out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>.
This results in:
`y / x = p` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>

This manipulation reveals a fundamental truth about the relationship between `y`, `x`, and `p`, stripped of any specific context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>. This abstract truth can then be reapplied to every specific scenario, providing insights that might not be immediately obvious in a concrete example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>.

Ultimately, [[the_abstraction_and_generalization_in_algebra|algebra]] allows humanity to understand the "true structure of the universe" by stripping away specific human definitions and [[practical_applications_of_algebra_in_daily_life_and_science|applications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>. It is a universal language, serving as a common ground for communication and understanding, even across vastly different forms of intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>.

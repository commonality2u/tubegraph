In probability, two or more events are considered mutually exclusive if they cannot happen at the same time during a single [[trial_and_event_in_probability | trial]] or experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. If events are mutually exclusive, the probability of both occurring simultaneously is 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

## Example: Rolling a Die

Consider the experiment of rolling a fair die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. The die has six equally likely [[sample_space_and_possible_outcomes | possibilities]]: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

If you are asked to find the probability of rolling a 2 *and* a 3 in a single roll of the die, these two events are mutually exclusive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
In any given roll, you can only obtain one outcome (either a 2 or a 3, but not both simultaneously) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

*   **Number of equally likely [[sample_space_and_possible_outcomes | possibilities]]**: 6 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>
*   **Number of [[sample_space_and_possible_outcomes | possibilities]] that meet the conditions (rolling a 2 and a 3)**: 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>

Therefore, the probability of rolling a 2 and a 3 on a single roll is 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. There is no way for a normal die to yield both a 2 and a 3 on one [[trial_and_event_in_probability | trial]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

The [[inflammatory_response_overview | inflammatory response]] is the initial "field of battle" for the immune system when pathogens bypass the body's first line of defense, such as skin or mucous membranes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This complex process involves various types of white blood cells, which are crucial for combating infection and initiating repair.

## Initial Response and Signaling

When the skin is pierced, for example, by a nail, damaged skin cells immediately release chemical messengers called **chemokines** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. These small molecules signal that damage has occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

In addition to chemokines, **mast cells**, which reside among skin cells, can be activated by direct contact with the foreign object (e.g., rusty nail), released chemokines, or molecules from invading bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. Activated mast cells release [[role_of_histamine_in_inflammation | histamine]], a key actor in the [[inflammatory_response_overview | inflammatory response]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

Histamine causes **vasodilation**, making the capillaries larger and their walls more porous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. This increased permeability allows various components of the immune system to reach the site of injury.

## Role of Phagocytes

### Neutrophils

**Neutrophils** are the most abundant type of phagocyte and act as the body's primary "first responders" during an inflammatory event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. They are attracted to the site of injury by the released chemokines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

To reach the affected tissue from the bloodstream, neutrophils undergo a process called **marginalization**, where they roll along the capillary walls and adhere to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. They then squeeze through the widened gaps in the capillary walls, a process known as **diapedesis** or **extravasation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. Once in the interstitial fluid, neutrophils phagocytose (engulf and consume) bacteria and damaged cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

### Dendritic Cells

**Dendritic cells** are another type of phagocyte that tend to reside near the skin and other interfaces with the outside world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. They are skilled at phagocytosing particles, such as viruses, and then presenting them on their surfaces to activate helper T-cells, effectively "ringing the alarm bell" for the specific immune system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

## Involvement of Other White Blood Cells

Due to vasodilation and increased capillary permeability, other white blood cells, including **B-cells** and **T-cells**, also make their way to the site of inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. Similar to neutrophils, they undergo marginalization and diapedesis to cross into the affected tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. Once there, they can be activated to carry out functions of the [[specific_immune_system_and_lymphocytes | specific immune system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.

The [[nonspecific_immune_response_and_inflammatory_response | inflammatory response]] is generally categorized as [[nonspecific_immune_response_and_inflammatory_response | nonspecific]] because it occurs regardless of the specific pathogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. However, it serves as the crucial battleground where both [[nonspecific_immune_response_and_inflammatory_response | nonspecific]] actors, like neutrophils, and [[specific_immune_system_and_lymphocytes | specific]] actors, like B-cells and T-cells, converge to defend the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. The [[complement_system_in_immune_response | complement system]], a set of inactive proteins in blood plasma that become activated during inflammation, also contributes to the initial nonspecific fight against pathogens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.

## Contribution to Inflammatory Symptoms

The accumulation of fluid (exudate), red blood cells, and various white blood cells in the affected area, due to vasodilation and increased capillary porosity, causes the visible macro-symptoms of inflammation: redness, swelling, and heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>.

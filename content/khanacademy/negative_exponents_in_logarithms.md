[[Logarithms|Logarithms]] are fundamentally linked to [[exponent_rules_and_radicals | exponents]], serving as the [[inverse_relationship_between_logarithms_and_exponents | inverse of exponentiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. While [[introduction_to_logarithms | logarithms]] can sometimes be confusing due to this inverse relationship, understanding how negative [[exponent_rules_and_radicals | exponents]] apply can clarify specific scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## Understanding Negative Exponents in Logarithms

When evaluating a [[introduction_to_logarithms | logarithm]] where the argument (the number inside the logarithm) is a fraction or an inverse of a power of the base, the result will involve a negative [[exponent_rules_and_radicals | exponent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

### Example: Logarithm of a Fraction

Consider the expression: `log base 8 of 1/64` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

To evaluate this, we ask:
> "8 to what power equals 1/64?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>

We know that `log base 8 of 64` would equal 2, because 8 squared is 64 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. However, since the argument is `1/64`, which is the inverse of 64, a negative [[exponent_rules_and_radicals | exponent]] is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

Using [[exponent_rules_and_radicals | negative exponent rules]]:
```
8^-2 = 1 / 8^2 = 1/64
```
Therefore, `8 to the power of -2` equals `1/64` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

So, `log base 8 of 1/64` is equal to -2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

> [!Tip]
> When you take the inverse of the number you are taking the [[introduction_to_logarithms | logarithm]] of, it generally turns the answer negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

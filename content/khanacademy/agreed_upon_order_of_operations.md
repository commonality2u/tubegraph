The [[introduction_to_order_of_operations | order of operations]] dictates a specific sequence for performing mathematical computations. A solid understanding of this concept is fundamental, as nearly everything else in mathematics relies upon it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Its primary purpose is to ensure a single, consistent way to [[solving_arithmetic_expressions_using_order_of_operations | interpret a mathematical statement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## The Problem Without a Set Order

Without an agreed-upon [[introduction_to_order_of_operations | order of operations]], a single mathematical statement could yield different results, leading to significant problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

Consider the example: `7 + 3 * 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

### Example: Different Interpretations

If there were no agreed-upon rules, this expression could be [[examples_of_different_interpretations_without_a_set_order_of_operations | interpreted]] in at least two ways:

1.  **Left-to-Right Interpretation:** Perform addition first, then multiplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
    *   `7 + 3 = 10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>
    *   `10 * 5 = 50` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>
2.  **Multiplication-First Interpretation:** Perform multiplication first, then addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
    *   `3 * 5 = 15` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>
    *   `7 + 15 = 22` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>

This scenario, where two different answers arise from the same statement, is "completely unacceptable" in mathematics, especially for critical computations like sending something to the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. This highlights the [[importance_of_order_of_operations_in_mathematics | importance]] of a universal [[introduction_to_order_of_operations | order of operations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## The Agreed-Upon Order

The universally accepted [[introduction_to_order_of_operations | order of operations]] ensures that everyone arrives at the same answer for a given statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. The sequence of operations is as follows:

1.  **Parentheses** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>
2.  **Exponents** (not covered in detail in this video's examples) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>
3.  **Multiplication** and **Division** (same level of priority, performed left to right) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>
4.  **Addition** and **Subtraction** (same level of priority, performed left to right) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>

## Applying the Order

Let's re-examine the previous example using the agreed-upon [[introduction_to_order_of_operations | order of operations]]:

### Example 1: `7 + 3 * 5`

1.  **Parentheses:** None <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
2.  **Exponents:** None <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
3.  **Multiplication/Division:** Perform `3 * 5` first, as multiplication has priority over addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
    *   `3 * 5 = 15` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>
4.  **Addition/Subtraction:** Perform the addition.
    *   `7 + 15 = 22` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>

Therefore, the correct interpretation of `7 + 3 * 5` is `22` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

### Example 2: `(7 + 3) * 4 / 2 - 5 * 6`

Let's apply the [[introduction_to_order_of_operations | order of operations]] step-by-step to a more complex expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>:

1.  **Parentheses:** Evaluate `(7 + 3)` first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
    *   `(7 + 3) = 10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>
    *   The expression becomes: `10 * 4 / 2 - 5 * 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>
2.  **Exponents:** None.
3.  **Multiplication/Division:** Perform these operations from left to right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
    *   `10 * 4 = 40` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>
    *   The expression becomes: `40 / 2 - 5 * 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>
    *   `40 / 2 = 20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>
    *   `5 * 6 = 30` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>
    *   The expression becomes: `20 - 30` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>
4.  **Addition/Subtraction:** Perform the subtraction.
    *   `20 - 30 = -10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>

The correct interpretation of the complex statement is `-10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

## Operations at the Same Level

When multiple operations exist at the same level of priority (e.g., addition and subtraction, or multiplication and division), they should be performed from left to right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

*   **Addition and Subtraction:** For `1 + 2 - 3 + 4 - 1`, perform left to right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
    *   `1 + 2 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>
    *   `3 - 3 = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>
    *   `0 + 4 = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>
    *   `4 - 1 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>
*   **Multiplication and Division:** For `4 * 2 / 3 * 2`, perform left to right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
    *   `4 * 2 = 8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>
    *   `8 / 3 = 8/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>
    *   `8/3 * 2 = 16/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>

## When Order Doesn't Matter

The specific order of operations is less critical when an expression contains *only* addition or *only* multiplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

*   **All Addition:** For `1 + 5 + 7 + 3 + 2`, the order of addition does not affect the final sum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   **All Multiplication:** Similarly, for `1 * 5 * 7 * 3 * 2`, the order of multiplication does not affect the final product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

However, if any division or subtraction is introduced, it is best to strictly follow the left-to-right rule for operations at the same level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

From: [[khanacademy]] <br/> 

When [[solving_algebraic_equations | solving algebraic equations]], the primary goal is to [[solving_algebraic_equations | isolate an x]] to find the value of the variable, resulting in an expression like "x equals something" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This process involves performing a series of [[equivalent_transformations_in_algebra | operations]] on both sides of the equation until the variable is alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. It's crucial to understand the logic behind these [[algebraic_techniques_for_solving_equations | algebraic steps]] rather than just memorizing rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, as [[visualizing_algebraic_operations | visualizing what's happening]] makes the allowed operations common sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Example: Solving a More Involved Equation

Consider the equation:
`2x + 3 = 5x - 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>

This equation might seem complex because it has variables (`x`) on both sides and involves both addition and subtraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

### Visualizing the Equation

To better understand the process, imagine the equation visually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>:

> The left side, `2x + 3`, can be seen as two 'x' units and three '+1' units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
> The right side, `5x - 2`, represents five 'x' units and two '-1' units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

The goal is to [[visualizing_algebraic_operations | visualize what this equation is saying]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

### Step-by-Step Solution

The core principle is that as long as you perform [[equivalent_transformations_in_algebra | legitimate operations]] (doing the same thing to both sides), you will arrive at the correct answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

#### 1. Consolidate 'x' Terms

To [[solving_algebraic_equations | isolate the x's]] on one side, we can start by removing `2x` from both sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. This ensures a positive number of [[understanding_like_terms_in_algebra | x's]] on the right side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

*   **Algebraic Step**:
    `2x + 3 - 2x = 5x - 2 - 2x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>
    On the left, the `2x` terms [[understanding_like_terms_in_algebra | cancel out]], leaving `3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
    On the right, `5x - 2x` simplifies to `3x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
    The equation becomes: `3 = 3x - 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>
*   **Visual Step**: Removing two 'x' units from both sides leaves `+3` on the left and `3x - 2` on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

#### 2. Isolate the 'x' Term

Now, to further [[solving_algebraic_equations | isolate the x's]], we need to eliminate the `-2` from the right side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. We achieve this by adding `2` to both sides.

*   **Algebraic Step**:
    `3 + 2 = 3x - 2 + 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>
    On the left, `3 + 2` equals `5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
    On the right, `-2 + 2` [[understanding_like_terms_in_algebra | cancels out]], leaving `3x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
    The equation becomes: `5 = 3x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>
*   **Visual Step**: Adding two '+1' units to both sides causes the '-1' units on the right to cancel out, leaving five '+1' units on the left and three 'x' units on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

#### 3. Solve for 'x'

The final step to [[solving_algebraic_equations | isolate the x]] is to divide both sides by the [[understanding_algebraic_expressions | coefficient]] of `x`, which is `3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

*   **Algebraic Step**:
    `5 / 3 = 3x / 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>
    On the right, the `3`'s [[understanding_like_terms_in_algebra | cancel out]], leaving `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
    On the left, `5 / 3` remains `5/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
    The solution is: `5/3 = x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>
*   **Alternative Form**: This is [[equivalent_transformations_in_algebra | equivalent]] to `x = 5/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. As a mixed number, `5/3` is `1 2/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   **Visual Step**: Dividing 5 units into 3 equal groups means each group will contain `1 2/3` units, corresponding to one 'x' unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. [[Visualizing algebraic operations | Visualizing with fractions]] can be more challenging but still holds true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

### Checking the Solution

After solving, it's good practice to [[checking_solutions_in_algebra | substitute the value of x]] back into the original equation to verify that it holds true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. This confirms that the [[equivalent_transformations_in_algebra | legitimate algebraic operations]] were performed correctly.

The [[Understanding the concept of slope | idea of a slope]] of a line is typically introduced early in algebra studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It's a fundamental concept that describes the steepness and direction of a line.

## Defining Slope

In algebra, the [[Slope of a Straight Line | slope of a line]] can be understood as:
*   "Rise over run" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   [[understanding slope as change in y over change in x | Change in y over change in x]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

For a linear equation in the [[Slopeintercept form of a linear equation | form]] of `y = mx + b`, the 'm' represents the slope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This [[Yintercept and slope of a linear equation | 'm' and 'b']] are constant values for a given line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Calculating the Slope of a Line

To [[finding the slope of a line | find the slope of a line]], two points on the line are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. The slope remains consistent along the entire line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

Consider two points on a line:
*   Point 1: `(a, f(a))` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>
*   Point 2: `(b, f(b))` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>

The formula for the slope (m) is:

$$m = \frac{\text{Change in y}}{\text{Change in x}} = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}$$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>

### Example Calculation

Let's use specific coordinates to make the concept concrete:
*   Point 1: `(2, 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>
*   Point 2: `(5, 7)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>

The slope is calculated as:
*   Change in y: `7 - 3 = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>
*   Change in x: `5 - 2 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>

Therefore, the slope of the line is `4/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

## Transition to Slopes of Curves

Unlike straight lines, the [[Slope of a Curve | slope of a curve]] is not constant; it changes at every point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. For example, on the curve `y = x^2`:
*   The slope is negative at points on the left side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   It becomes less negative as you move towards the origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   At `x = 0`, the slope is flat (zero) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   For positive x-values, the slope starts increasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

This changing slope means that the traditional algebraic definition of slope (using two distant points) yields the slope of a [[Slope of a curve using tangent lines | secant line]] that intersects the curve at two points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

To find the slope at a single point on a curve, a new approach is necessary, which involves taking the limit of the secant line's slope as the two points become infinitesimally close <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. This concept leads to the definition of the derivative in calculus, which represents the [[Slope of a curve using tangent lines | slope of the tangent line]] at a specific point on the curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.

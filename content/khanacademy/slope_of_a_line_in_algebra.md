The concept of a [[understanding_slope_of_a_straight_line | slope of a line]] is first introduced early in one's algebra career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. It is a fundamental aspect of [[properties_of_slope_in_linear_equations | linear equations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Visualizing a Line and its Slope

To understand slope, one can start by drawing axes: a y-axis (or f(x)-axis) and an x-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. A line can then be drawn on these axes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The goal is to [[finding_the_slope_of_a_line | find the slope of that line]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

For any straight line, the slope remains consistent throughout its entire length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. This means that if the equation of a line is expressed in [[Slopeintercept form | slope-intercept form]], `y = mx + b`, the 'm' value represents this consistent slope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Determining the Slope of a Line

To [[determining_slope | determine the slope]] of a straight line, two distinct points on the line are required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

Let's consider two arbitrary points on the line:
*   Point 1: (a, f(a)) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Here, 'a' is the x-coordinate, and 'f(a)' is the corresponding y-coordinate, obtained by evaluating the function `f` at `a` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   Point 2: (b, f(b)) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Similarly, 'b' is the x-coordinate, and 'f(b)' is the corresponding y-coordinate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### Slope Formula

The slope is commonly understood as:
*   "Rise over run" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>
*   "Change in y over change in x" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>

To calculate the [[graph_interpretation_for_slope_calculation | change in y]] (the "rise"), subtract the y-coordinate of the first point from the y-coordinate of the second point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>:
Change in y = f(b) - f(a) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>

To calculate the [[graph_interpretation_for_slope_calculation | change in x]] (the "run"), subtract the x-coordinate of the first point from the x-coordinate of the second point, ensuring consistency with the order chosen for the y-coordinates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>:
Change in x = b - a <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>

Therefore, the formula for the slope (m) of a line is:
$$m = \frac{\text{Change in y}}{\text{Change in x}} = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}$$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>

### Concrete Example

Let's use specific coordinates to illustrate the calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>:
*   Point 1: (2, 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>
*   Point 2: (5, 7) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>

To find the slope:
1.  **Change in y**: 7 - 3 = 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>
2.  **Change in x**: 5 - 2 = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>

So, the slope of the line is $\frac{4}{3}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> While the concept of slope can be generalized to curves in calculus, for a straight line, the slope is a constant value throughout its entire length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

Subtracting fractions with the same denominator is a straightforward process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. This concept is similar to [[adding_fractions_with_same_denominators | adding fractions with the same denominators]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.

## How to Subtract Fractions with the Same Denominator

When fractions have the same denominator, the process involves:
1.  **Keeping the denominator the same**: The bottom number of the fraction, which represents the total number of pieces, remains unchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.
2.  **Subtracting the numerators**: Only the top numbers (the numerators) are subtracted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

### Example 1: Basic Subtraction

Consider the problem `3/7 - 2/7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.
*   The denominators are both 7, so the denominator of the answer will also be 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.
*   Subtract the numerators: `3 - 2 = 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.
*   Therefore, `3/7 - 2/7 = 1/7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.

This makes sense in terms of a pie example: if you have 3 out of 7 pieces of a pie and you give away 2 out of those 7 pieces, you are left with 1 of the 7 pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

### Example 2: Subtracting a Whole Number

If you need to subtract a whole number from a fraction, you can rewrite the whole number as a fraction with the desired denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>.

For example, `1/10 - 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>:
*   Rewrite `1` as `10/10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>.
*   The problem becomes `1/10 - 10/10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>.
*   Subtract the numerators: `1 - 10 = -9` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>.
*   Keep the denominator: `10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>.
*   The result is `-9/10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>.

### Key Points
*   The **denominator** is the bottom number in a fraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.
*   The **numerator** is the top number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.
*   When [[finding_a_common_denominator_for_fractions | denominators are different]], they must be converted to a common denominator before subtraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. This often involves finding the [[finding_a_common_denominator_for_fractions | least common multiple]] of the denominators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.
*   [[Simplifying fractions | Simplifying the resulting fraction]] to its lowest terms is often required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.

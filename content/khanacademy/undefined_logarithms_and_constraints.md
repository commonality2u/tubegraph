Logarithms are an essential concept in mathematics, but they come with specific conditions under which they are defined. Understanding these constraints is crucial for [[evaluating_logarithmic_expressions | evaluating logarithmic expressions]] correctly.

## Logarithm Definition Review

A logarithm is the [[inverse_relationship_between_logarithms_and_exponents | inverse of taking the exponent]] of something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. For example, if 2 to the third power equals 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, then log base 2 of 8 equals 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This means, "2 to what power equals 8?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, and the answer is the exponent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## When Logarithms are Undefined

Logarithms are not defined for all numbers. Specifically, they are undefined when the argument (the number inside the logarithm) is zero or negative, assuming a positive base.

### Logarithm of Zero

Consider the expression log base 2 of 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. If we set this equal to `x`, it translates to 2 to the power of `x` equals 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

> There is no number that 2 can be raised to the power of to get 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Therefore, log base 2 of 0 is undefined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>, meaning there is no solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

### Logarithm of a Negative Number

Similarly, consider log base 3 of negative 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Assuming we are dealing with real numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>:

> There is nothing that 3 can be raised to the power of to get a negative number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Consequently, log base 3 of negative 1 is undefined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

### General Constraints for Defined Logarithms

For a logarithm to be defined in the real number system, under the assumption of a positive base:

> [!important] Logarithm Constraint
> The number for which the [[logarithm_properties_and_notation | logarithm]] is taken (the argument) must be greater than 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. It cannot be 0, and it cannot be negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

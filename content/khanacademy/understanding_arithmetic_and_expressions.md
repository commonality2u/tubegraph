When dealing with basic arithmetic, concrete numbers are used, such as 23 plus 5, 2 times 7, or 3 divided by 4, where the exact values are known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For instance, 23 plus 5 evaluates to 28 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Introducing Algebraic Expressions

As one transitions into the algebraic world, the concept of [[role_of_variables_in_expressions | variables]] is introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. [[role_of_variables_in_expressions | Variables]] are values within [[Simplifying expressions | expressions]] that can change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

For example, "x plus 5" is an [[Simplifying expressions | expression]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The value of this [[Simplifying expressions | expression]] changes depending on the value assigned to 'x' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   If x equals 1, the [[Simplifying expressions | expression]] "x plus 5" evaluates to 1 plus 5, which is 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   If x equals negative 7, the [[Simplifying expressions | expression]] "x plus 5" evaluates to negative 7 plus 5, which is negative 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
In this context, 'x' is a [[role_of_variables_in_expressions | variable]], and its value can change depending on the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

Other examples of [[Simplifying expressions | expressions]] include "y plus z" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. If y is 1 and z is 2, the [[Simplifying expressions | expression]] becomes 1 plus 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. If y is 0 and z is negative 1, it becomes 0 plus negative 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. These [[Simplifying expressions | expressions]] can be evaluated to a specific value based on the values of the [[role_of_variables_in_expressions | variables]] that form them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Difference Between Expressions and Equations

It is important to understand the [[difference_between_expressions_and_equations | distinction between an expression and an equation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   An [[Simplifying expressions | expression]] is a statement of value or quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The value of an [[Simplifying expressions | expression]] changes based on the value of its [[role_of_variables_in_expressions | variables]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   An equation sets two [[Simplifying expressions | expressions]] equal to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. For example, "x plus 3 is equal to 1" is an equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

In an equation with only one unknown [[role_of_variables_in_expressions | variable]], like "x plus 3 equals 1," the value of 'x' can be determined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. In this case, x must be negative 2, because negative 2 plus 3 equals 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Equations constrain the possible values a [[role_of_variables_in_expressions | variable]] can take <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

An equation can also involve multiple [[role_of_variables_in_expressions | variables]], such as "x plus y plus z equals 5" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. In this case, '5' is also considered an [[Simplifying expressions | expression]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. If values are provided for some [[role_of_variables_in_expressions | variables]], the others become constrained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. For instance, if y is 3 and z is 2, the equation becomes "x plus 3 plus 2 equals 5," which simplifies to "x plus 5 equals 5" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This constrains 'x' to be 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

The key takeaway is that in an equation, two [[Simplifying expressions | expressions]] are set as equal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, and a [[role_of_variables_in_expressions | variable]] can take on different values depending on the problem's context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

## Evaluating Expressions with Variables

To demonstrate, consider evaluating various [[Simplifying expressions | expressions]] with different [[role_of_variables_in_expressions | variable]] values:

### Example 1: Exponentiation
Consider the [[Simplifying expressions | expression]] "x to the y power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   If x equals 5 and y equals 2, the [[Simplifying expressions | expression]] evaluates to 5 to the second power (5²), which is 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   If x equals negative 2 and y equals 3, the [[Simplifying expressions | expression]] evaluates to negative 2 to the third power ((-2)³), which is negative 2 multiplied by itself three times ((-2) * (-2) * (-2)), resulting in negative 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

### Example 2: Complex Expression
Consider the [[Simplifying expressions | expression]] "the square root of (x plus y) minus x" (√x + y - x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   If x equals 1 and y equals 8, the [[Simplifying expressions | expression]] is evaluated by substituting these values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
    *   The square root of (1 plus 8) is the square root of 9, which is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
    *   Then, subtract x (which is 1) from 3, resulting in 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
    *   Thus, for x=1 and y=8, the [[Simplifying expressions | expression]] evaluates to 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

In the realm of [[introduction_to_probability | probability]], [[events_and_outcomes_in_probability | events]] are considered **mutually exclusive** if they cannot occur at the same time during a single [[experimentation_in_probability | experiment]] or trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>.

## Characteristics

When two [[events_and_outcomes_in_probability | events]] are mutually exclusive:
*   They cannot both happen on a single trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>.
*   The [[introduction_to_probability | probability]] of both [[events_and_outcomes_in_probability | events]] occurring simultaneously is 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>.

## Example: Rolling a Die

Consider the [[experimentation_in_probability | experiment]] of rolling a fair six-sided die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>. There are six [[sample_space_in_probability | equally likely possibilities]]: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.

If you are asked for the [[introduction_to_probability | probability]] of rolling a 2 *and* a 3 on a single roll of the die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>, these are mutually exclusive [[events_and_outcomes_in_probability | events]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>.
*   In one roll, you can only get one outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>.
*   It is impossible to get both a 2 and a 3 on the same roll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>.
*   Therefore, the [[introduction_to_probability | probability]] of rolling a 2 and a 3 simultaneously is 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>.

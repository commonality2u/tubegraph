In [[basic_probability_concepts | probability]], an event is a specific outcome or set of outcomes from an experiment. Sometimes, events cannot happen at the same time during a single trial of an experiment. These are known as mutually exclusive events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

## Defining Mutually Exclusive Events

Mutually exclusive events are events that cannot occur simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. If one event happens, the other(s) cannot. The probability of two mutually exclusive events occurring together in a single trial is 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

## Example: Rolling a Fair Die

Consider an experiment of rolling a fair die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. When rolling a fair die, there are six [[equally_likely_possibilities_in_probability | equally likely possibilities]]: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

If asked, "What is the probability of rolling a 2 AND a 3?" on a single roll of the die, the answer is 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. In one roll of the die, you can only get a 2 *or* a 3, not both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. The [[sample_space_in_probability | possibilities]] do not include any outcome where both a 2 and a 3 appear simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Therefore, getting a 2 and getting a 3 are mutually exclusive events in a single roll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

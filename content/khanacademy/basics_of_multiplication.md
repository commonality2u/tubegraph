Learning to multiply can be approached by working through [[Understanding multiplication using examples | examples]] and understanding their meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Multiplication as Repeated Addition

[[Multiplication as repeated addition | Multiplication]] is essentially a simplified method for performing addition repeatedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

Consider the example "2 times 3":
*   This can be understood as adding the number 2 to itself three times: 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   Alternatively, it can be interpreted as adding the number 3 to itself two times: 3 + 3 = 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Property of Multiplication
> Regardless of how "2 times 3" is interpreted (adding 2 three times or adding 3 two times), the answer remains the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. This demonstrates that the order of the numbers in multiplication does not change the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

This concept can also be expressed by saying "four 3's" (meaning 3 added four times) or "three 4's" (meaning 4 added three times) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

## [[Importance and utility of multiplication | Utility of Multiplication]]

[[Importance and utility of multiplication | Multiplication is useful]] because it simplifies the process of counting, especially with larger quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

For example, to count lemons arranged in rows:
*   If there are 3 lemons in each row <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>, and there are 4 rows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>, the total number of lemons can be found by multiplying 4 times 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.
*   This is equivalent to 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   It is also equivalent to 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
*   Counting individually would be 12 lemons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

While counting small numbers might seem quicker initially, [[Importance and utility of multiplication | multiplication]] becomes invaluable when dealing with large numbers, such as 100 lemons per row and 100 rows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

## Special Cases in Multiplication

### Multiplying by One (1)
Any number multiplied by 1, or 1 multiplied by any number, results in that original number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
*   For example, 3 times 1 means "three 1's" (1 + 1 + 1 = 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.
*   It can also mean "3 one time," which is simply 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.
*   Examples: 100 times 1 = 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>, and 1 times 39 = 39 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

### Multiplying by Zero (0)
Any number multiplied by 0, or 0 multiplied by any number, results in 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.
*   For example, 4 times 0 means "zero four times" (0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.
*   It can also mean "4 zero times," which implies nothing is written or present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
*   Examples: 5,493,692 times 0 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>, and 0 times 17 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

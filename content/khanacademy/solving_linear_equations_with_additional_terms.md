When [[solving_simple_linear_equations|solving linear equations]] that include additional constant terms, the process requires an initial step to isolate the variable term before division. These are considered slightly more complicated equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

Consider an equation like `3x + 5 = 17` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Unlike simpler equations such as `3x = 17`, where you could directly divide both sides by 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, the `+ 5` term complicates matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Conceptual Understanding

Conceptually, `3x` represents three instances of `x` (e.g., `x + x + x`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. The `+ 5` indicates five additional objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. The entire expression `3x + 5` is equal to 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

To maintain equality, any operation performed on one side of the equation must also be performed on the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Steps to Solve

The general approach to [[solving_equations_with_variables|solving equations with variables]] and additional terms is to first eliminate the constant term, then isolate the variable.

### Example 1: `3x + 5 = 17`

1.  **Eliminate the constant term:** To get `3x` alone on the left side, the `+ 5` needs to be removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
    *   Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
    *   `3x + 5 - 5 = 17 - 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>
    *   On the left, `5 - 5` cancels out, leaving `3x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
    *   On the right, `17 - 5` equals 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
    *   The equation simplifies to `3x = 12` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

2.  **Isolate the variable:**
    *   Divide both sides of the equation by 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
    *   `3x / 3 = 12 / 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>
    *   On the left, `3x / 3` leaves `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
    *   On the right, `12 / 3` equals 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
    *   Therefore, `x = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

### Example 2: `7x - 2 = -10`

This example introduces negative numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

1.  **Eliminate the constant term:** To simplify the left-hand side to just `7x`, get rid of the `-2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
    *   Add 2 to both sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
    *   `7x - 2 + 2 = -10 + 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>
    *   On the left, `-2 + 2` is 0, leaving `7x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
    *   On the right, `-10 + 2` is -8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. (Adding a positive number to a negative number moves it closer to zero or into positive territory on the number line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.)
    *   The equation simplifies to `7x = -8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

2.  **Isolate the variable:**
    *   Divide both sides of the equation by 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.
    *   `7x / 7 = -8 / 7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>
    *   On the left, `7x / 7` leaves `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
    *   On the right, `-8 / 7` results in a fraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
    *   Therefore, `x = -8/7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, or as a mixed number, `x = -1 and 1/7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

> [!tip] Key Principle
> To maintain the equality of an equation, any operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) performed on one side must also be performed on the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This ensures the truth of the equation remains intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

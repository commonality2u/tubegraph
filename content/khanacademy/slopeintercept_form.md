From: [[khanacademy]] <br/> 

The [[properties_of_slope_in_linear_equations | slope-intercept form]] is a particularly useful way to represent a linear equation, making it easy to determine the line's [[yintercept_calculation | y-intercept]] and [[finding_the_slope_of_a_line | slope]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. While linear equations can be expressed in an infinite number of equivalent ways, such as `y - 5 = 2(x - 1)` or `-2x + y = 3`, the [[properties_of_slope_in_linear_equations | slope-intercept form]] explicitly highlights key properties of the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## General Form

The general structure of a linear equation in [[properties_of_slope_in_linear_equations | slope-intercept form]] is:
`y = mx + b` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>

In this form:
*   `m` represents the [[determining_slope | slope]] of the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
*   `b` represents the [[yintercept_calculation | y-intercept]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

## Identifying Components

### The Y-Intercept (b)

The constant term `b` in the equation `y = mx + b` directly indicates the [[yintercept_calculation | y-intercept]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. The [[yintercept_calculation | y-intercept]] is the point where the line crosses the y-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. This occurs when `x` is equal to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

**Example**: For the equation `y = 2x + 3`:
*   If `x = 0`, then `y = 2(0) + 3 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   The [[yintercept_calculation | y-intercept]] is the point `(0, 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

### The Slope (m)

The coefficient `m` of the `x` term in the equation `y = mx + b` represents the [[finding_the_slope_of_a_line | slope]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. The [[understanding_slope_of_a_straight_line | slope]] describes the "rise over run" of the line, or the ratio of the change in `y` (delta y) to the change in `x` (delta x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

**Example**: For the equation `y = 2x + 3`:
*   The [[determining_slope | slope]] `m` is `2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   This means for every increase of `1` in `x`, `y` increases by `2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
    *   If `x` increases by `1` (from `0` to `1`), `y` increases by `2` (from `3` to `5`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
    *   If `x` increases by `1` (from `1` to `2`), `y` increases by `2` (from `5` to `7`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   The ratio of change in `y` to change in `x` (`Δy/Δx`) is always `2/1 = 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

## Graphing from Slope-Intercept Form

[[graph_interpretation_for_slope_calculation | Graphing a linear equation]] is straightforward using the [[properties_of_slope_in_linear_equations | slope-intercept form]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

**Steps**:
1.  **Plot the [[yintercept_calculation | y-intercept]]**: Identify the `b` value and plot the point `(0, b)` on the y-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
2.  **Use the [[determining_slope | slope]]**: From the [[yintercept_calculation | y-intercept]], use the `m` value (rise over run) to find a second point.
    *   If `m` is a positive integer (e.g., `2`), move up `m` units and right `1` unit.
    *   If `m` is a negative integer (e.g., `-1`), move down `|m|` units and right `1` unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
3.  **Draw the line**: Draw a straight line through the two plotted points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

### Example: `y = -x + 2`

*   **[[yintercept_calculation | Y-intercept]]**: The `b` value is `2`, so the line intersects the y-axis at `(0, 2)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   **[[determining_slope | Slope]]**: The coefficient of `x` is `-1`, so the [[determining_slope | slope]] `m` is `-1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
    *   This means for every `1` unit increase in `x`, `y` decreases by `1` unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

This form provides a quick and intuitive way to visualize the graph of a linear equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

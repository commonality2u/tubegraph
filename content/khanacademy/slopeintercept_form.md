A linear equation can be represented in an infinite number of ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. For example, `y = 2x + 3` can also be written as `-2x + y = 3` or `y - 5 = 2(x - 1)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. These are all equivalent and can be transformed from one to another using algebraic operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. However, one particular representation is very useful: the [[identifying_slope_and_yintercept | slope-intercept form]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>.

## Understanding Slope-Intercept Form

The [[identifying_slope_and_yintercept | slope-intercept form]] of a linear equation is typically written as `y = mx + b` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>. This form is named for the two key pieces of information it explicitly provides: the [[slope_of_a_straight_line | slope]] and the [[identifying_slope_and_yintercept | y-intercept]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

### Identifying the Y-intercept

The 'b' term in the slope-intercept equation `y = mx + b` represents the [[identifying_slope_and_yintercept | y-intercept]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>. The [[identifying_slope_and_yintercept | y-intercept]] is the point where the line crosses the y-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. This occurs when the x-value is zero.

For example, consider the equation `y = 2x + 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
If x = 0, then `y = 2(0) + 3`, which simplifies to `y = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.
Therefore, the [[identifying_slope_and_yintercept | y-intercept]] is the point (0, 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. It is very easy to find the [[identifying_slope_and_yintercept | y-intercept]] from this form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.

### Identifying the Slope

The 'm' term in the slope-intercept equation `y = mx + b` represents the [[slope_of_a_straight_line | slope]] of the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>. The [[slope_of_a_straight_line | slope]] describes the steepness and direction of the line and is defined as the change in y (delta y, Δy) divided by the change in x (delta x, Δx) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.

Using the example `y = 2x + 3`:
*   If x increases by 1 (Δx = 1), y increases by 2 (Δy = 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.
    *   When x = 0, y = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.
    *   When x = 1, y = 2(1) + 3 = 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>. (Δy = 5 - 3 = 2)
*   If x increases by 1 again (Δx = 1), y increases by 2 again (Δy = 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.
    *   When x = 2, y = 2(2) + 3 = 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. (Δy = 7 - 5 = 2)

In this equation, the [[slope_of_a_straight_line | slope]] (Δy/Δx) is `2/1 = 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>. This value, 2, is the coefficient of x in the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. This relationship holds true for any linear equation in [[identifying_slope_and_yintercept | slope-intercept form]]: the coefficient of x is the [[slope_of_a_straight_line | slope]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>.

## Graphing from Slope-Intercept Form

The [[identifying_slope_and_yintercept | slope-intercept form]] makes [[graphing_using_slope_and_intercept | graphing]] a linear equation very intuitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>.

To [[graphing_using_slope_and_intercept | graph]] `y = 2x + 3`:
1.  **Plot the Y-intercept**: Begin by plotting the [[identifying_slope_and_yintercept | y-intercept]] (0, 3) on the coordinate plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.
    *   ```
        ^ y-axis
        |
        3 * (0,3)
        |
        2
        |
        1
        |
        +-------> x-axis
        0 1 2 3
        ```
2.  **Use the Slope to Find Additional Points**: From the [[identifying_slope_and_yintercept | y-intercept]], use the [[slope_of_a_straight_line | slope]] (2 or 2/1) to find other points. A [[slope_of_a_straight_line | slope]] of 2 means for every 1 unit you move to the right on the x-axis, you move 2 units up on the y-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.
    *   From (0,3), move 1 unit right and 2 units up to reach (1, 5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.
    *   From (1,5), move 1 unit right and 2 units up to reach (2, 7) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>.
    *   Conversely, if you move 1 unit left (Δx = -1), you move 2 units down (Δy = -2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>. From (0,3), move 1 unit left and 2 units down to reach (-1, 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>.

Once at least two points are found, a straight line can be drawn through them to represent the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.

## Another Example

Consider `y = -x + 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>.
*   **Y-intercept**: The 'b' value is 2, so the [[identifying_slope_and_yintercept | y-intercept]] is (0, 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>.
*   **Slope**: The coefficient of x is -1, so the [[slope_of_a_straight_line | slope]] is -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>.
    *   A [[slope_of_a_straight_line | slope]] of -1 means that as x increases by 1, y decreases by 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>.
    *   If you increase x by 2, y decreases by 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>.

This makes [[graphing_using_slope_and_intercept | graphing]] quick: start at (0, 2) on the y-axis, then move 1 unit right and 1 unit down repeatedly to plot more points and draw the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>. The [[identifying_slope_and_yintercept | slope-intercept form]] provides all the necessary information for a quick sketch of a line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>.

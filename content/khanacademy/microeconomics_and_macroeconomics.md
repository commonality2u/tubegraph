As we begin our journey into the world of [[introduction_to_economics | economics]], it's helpful to start with a foundational quote from Adam Smith, a Scottish philosopher considered by some to be the first real economist in the modern sense [00:00:00]. His work, *The Wealth of Nations*, published in 1776, coincidentally the same year as the American Declaration of Independence, introduced many core concepts [00:00:17].

## The Invisible Hand

Adam Smith's most famous concept, often referred to as "the invisible hand," suggests that an economic actor, when pursuing their own gain, often promotes public interest without intending to do so [00:00:28]. "He intends only his own gain," Smith writes, "and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention" [00:00:46]. This term is famous [00:00:56].

The idea is that when individuals act purely in their own self-interest, this can often lead to aggregate outcomes that none of the individual actors intended [00:01:04]. Smith argued that this is not necessarily detrimental to society; by pursuing personal interest, an individual "frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it" [00:01:18]. This concept is at the core of capitalism [00:01:30] and has been as influential to the overall experience of Americans as the Declaration of Independence or the Constitution [00:01:46].

While not advocating for constant self-interest without regard for consequences, Smith suggested that frequently, such self-interested action could lead to a greater good, fostering innovation, better investment, increased productivity, and more wealth for everyone [00:02:29].

## Branches of Economics

Adam Smith's statements often blend [[introduction_to_economics | microeconomic]] and [[introduction_to_economics | macroeconomic]] principles [00:02:47]. Modern economists typically divide the field into two main subjects:

### Microeconomics

[[introduction_to_economics | Microeconomics]] is the study of individual actors [00:03:08]. These actors can include firms, individual people, or households [00:03:16]. Microeconomics focuses on how these actors make decisions or [[tradeoffs_and_resource_allocation | allocations]] of [[scarce_resources_and_economic_decision_making | scarce resources]] [00:03:36]. [[scarce_resources_and_economic_decision_making | Scarce resources]] are those that are not infinite, such as food, water, money, time, or labor [00:03:57]. Microeconomics examines how the deployment of these resources affects [[price_adjustments_and_market_dynamics | prices]] and markets [00:04:19].

### Macroeconomics

[[introduction_to_economics | Macroeconomics]] is the study of the economy in aggregate [00:03:21], observing what happens when millions of individual actors interact [00:04:32]. It often focuses on policy-related questions, such as the impact of raising or lowering taxes, or the effects of regulation or deregulation on overall productivity [00:04:45]. These are often considered "top-down" questions [00:05:00].

## [[economics_and_mathematical_models | Economics and Mathematical Models]]

In both micro- and macroeconomics, especially in the modern sense, there is an attempt to make the study rigorous and mathematical [00:05:06]. This involves starting with philosophical or logical ideas about how people make decisions [00:05:16], then simplifying them [00:05:45]. For instance, assumptions might be made that "all people are rational" or that they will "maximize their gain," even though human beings are motivated by many factors [00:05:49].

This mathematical approach is valuable for clarifying thinking and allows economists to prove things based on their assumptions [00:06:11]. It enables visualization through charts and graphs, helping to understand market dynamics [00:06:17]. However, it can also be dangerous due to the significant simplifications involved [00:06:27]. Mathematical conclusions might seem strongly proven, like principles in physics, but they are based on assumptions that could be wrong, oversimplified, or irrelevant to the context being studied [00:06:43]. Therefore, it's crucial to approach economic models with a "grain of salt" [00:06:55].

Macroeconomics is arguably more susceptible to these issues, as it aggregates the complex interactions of millions of infinitely complicated individuals [00:07:02]. This leads to fundamentally unpredictable interactions [00:07:21]. While building mathematical models and predictions is valuable, it must always be remembered that they are based on simplifying assumptions and should be taken with a "grain of salt" [00:07:41]. The most important takeaway from economics is developing intuition to reason through what is likely to happen, even without the mathematics [00:07:58].

## Critiques of Economics

Two quotes highlight the nuances and challenges of economic study:

*   Alfred Knopf, a publisher in the 1900s, famously quipped: "An economist is a man who states the obvious in terms of the incomprehensible" [00:08:17]. This suggests that economics often takes common-sense observations and presents them through complex mathematical frameworks [00:08:43]. It's vital to maintain intuition and recognize when the math might be leading to strange conclusions due to over-simplifications [00:08:49].
*   Lawrence J. Peter, a professor at USC, observed: "An economist is an expert know will know tomorrow why the things he predicted yesterday didn't happen today" [00:09:02]. This quote is particularly relevant to [[introduction_to_economics | macroeconomics]], where predictions about economic growth, recessions, or inflation are common but frequently prove incorrect, with economists often disagreeing [00:09:14]. This underscores that economics, despite its mathematical rigor, is not a science like physics; it is open to subjectivity, largely based on the assumptions chosen by the economist [00:09:42].

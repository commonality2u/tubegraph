[[simplifying_radicals | Simplifying radicals]] involves breaking down the number under the radical sign into factors, particularly identifying and extracting perfect squares. This process is an extension of basic exponent rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Understanding Radicals

A radical is a symbol that typically represents the square root <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. For example, the square root of 36 is 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. The square root symbol is equivalent to raising a number to the 1/2 power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This means that rules like `(ab)^n = a^n * b^n` also apply to radicals, allowing `√(ab) = √a * √b` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This connection demonstrates that [[using_exponents_in_radical_simplification | radical simplification]] is not a new concept but an extension of existing exponent rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## The Simplification Process

To simplify a radical, the goal is to find the largest factor of the number under the radical sign that is also a perfect square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Perfect squares are numbers like 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, and so on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

### Examples

### Example 1: Square Root of 72

To simplify the square root of 72, recognize that 72 can be factored into 36 times 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   √72 = √(36 × 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>
*   Using exponent rules, this can be split into √36 × √2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>
*   Since √36 is 6, the simplified form is 6√2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>

### Example 2: Square Root of 50

For the square root of 50, factor 50 as 25 times 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   √50 = √(25 × 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>
*   This becomes √25 × √2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>
*   Since √25 is 5, the simplified form is 5√2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>
If other factors like 5 and 10 were chosen, simplification wouldn't be possible as neither are perfect squares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

### Example 3: 7 times the Square Root of 27

Consider 7√27 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   Factor 27 into 9 times 3, as 9 is a perfect square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
*   7√27 = 7√(9 × 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>
*   This equals 7 × √9 × √3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>
*   Since √9 is 3, the expression becomes 7 × 3 × √3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>
*   The final simplified form is 21√3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

### Example 4: 9 times the Square Root of 18

For 9√18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   Factor 18 into 9 times 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   9√18 = 9√(2 × 9) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>
*   This equals 9 × √2 × √9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>
*   Since √9 is 3, the expression becomes 9 × √2 × 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>
*   The result is 27√2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

### Example 5: 4 times the Square Root of 25

Sometimes the number under the radical is itself a perfect square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.
*   4√25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>
*   Since √25 is 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   The expression simplifies to 4 × 5, which is 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

### Example 6: 3 times the Square Root of 29 (Non-Simplifiable)

If the number under the radical is a [[prime_factorization | prime number]], like 29, it only has factors of 1 and itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Neither 1 nor 29 are perfect squares (other than 1, which doesn't simplify).
*   3√29 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>
*   This expression cannot be simplified further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

### Example 7: 7 times the Square Root of 320 (Step-by-step simplification)

For larger numbers, factorization can be done in multiple steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
*   7√320 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>
*   Recognize that 16 is a factor of 320 (320 = 16 × 20) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
*   7√(16 × 20) = 7 × √16 × √20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>
*   This simplifies to 7 × 4 × √20 = 28√20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
*   The number under the radical, 20, can be further factored as 4 × 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   28√20 = 28√(4 × 5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>
*   This becomes 28 × √4 × √5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>
*   Finally, 28 × 2 × √5 = 56√5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
This iterative process continues until the number under the radical has no perfect square factors left (other than 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

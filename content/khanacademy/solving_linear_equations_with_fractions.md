Solving [[solving_simple_linear_equations | linear equations]] that involve fractions requires a systematic approach, often leveraging the concept of reciprocals. The fundamental goal is to isolate the variable, typically denoted as `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Basic Principles

A linear equation often presents a coefficient multiplied by a variable, such as `5x = 20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The notation where a number is written directly next to a variable implies multiplication (e.g., `5x` means `5 times x`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. While simple equations like `5x = 20` can be solved mentally (`x=4`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, more complex numbers or fractions necessitate a procedural method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

The key to isolating `x` is to perform the inverse operation of the one applied to `x`. If `x` is being multiplied by a number, you divide by that number on both sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

### Using Reciprocals for Fractions

When dealing with fractions as coefficients, it is often easier to think in terms of [[multiplying_fractions | multiplying by the reciprocal]] rather than dividing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Multiplying by the reciprocal of a number is mathematically equivalent to dividing by that number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

The **coefficient** is the number being multiplied by the variable `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. To solve for `x`, you multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of the coefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

### Multiplication Notation

In algebra, the traditional multiplication sign `x` can be confused with the variable `x`. Therefore, other conventions are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>:
*   A dot (`•`) between numbers (e.g., `5 • x`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   Writing a number next to a variable (e.g., `5x`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   Writing a number next to a parenthesis containing a variable or expression (e.g., `5(x)`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

## Example 1: Solving `(-3/4)x = 10/13`

This type of problem cannot easily be solved mentally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

1.  **Identify the equation:**
    `-3/4x = 10/13` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>
2.  **Find the reciprocal of the coefficient:**
    The coefficient of `x` is `-3/4`. Its reciprocal is `-4/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
3.  **Multiply both sides by the reciprocal:**
    `(-4/3) • (-3/4)x = (10/13) • (-4/3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>
4.  **Simplify:**
    *   On the left side, `(-4/3)` and `(-3/4)` cancel out, leaving `1x` or just `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
    *   On the right side, [[multiplying_fractions | multiply the numerators]] and [[multiplying_fractions | denominators]]: `(10 * -4) / (13 * 3) = -40 / 39` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
5.  **Solution:**
    `x = -40/39` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>
    *   Fractions are often left in their improper form as they are easier to work with, but they can be converted to mixed numbers (e.g., `-1 and 1/39`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

### Verifying the Solution

A useful aspect of algebra is the ability to check your answer by substituting the solution back into the original equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

1.  **Original equation:** `-3/4x = 10/13` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>
2.  **Substitute `x = -40/39`:**
    `-3/4 • (-40/39) = 10/13` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>
3.  **Simplify by cross-cancellation (part of [[simplifying_fractions | simplifying fractions]] when multiplying):**
    *   `4` and `40` can be divided by `4` (becomes `1` and `10`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
    *   Multiply remaining terms: `(-3 * -10) / (1 * 39) = 30/39` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
4.  **Further simplify the resulting fraction:**
    *   Divide the numerator and denominator by `3`: `30/3 = 10`, `39/3 = 13` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
5.  **Final check:**
    `10/13 = 10/13` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. Since both sides are equal, the solution is correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

## Example 2: Solving `(-5/6)x = 7/8`

1.  **Identify the equation:**
    `-5/6x = 7/8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>
2.  **Find the reciprocal of the coefficient:**
    The coefficient is `-5/6`. Its reciprocal is `-6/5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
3.  **Multiply both sides by the reciprocal:**
    `(-6/5) • (-5/6)x = (7/8) • (-6/5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>
4.  **Simplify:**
    *   Left side simplifies to `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
    *   Right side: `8` and `6` can both be divided by `2` (becomes `4` and `3`). Remember the `6` was negative, so it becomes `-3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
    *   Multiply remaining terms: `(7 * -3) / (4 * 5) = -21/20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
5.  **Solution:**
    `x = -21/20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>

### Verifying the Solution

1.  **Original equation:** `-5/6x = 7/8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>
2.  **Substitute `x = -21/20`:**
    `-5/6 • (-21/20)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>
3.  **Simplify by cross-cancellation:**
    *   `5` and `20` can be divided by `5` (becomes `1` and `4`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
    *   `6` and `21` can be divided by `3` (becomes `2` and `7`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
    *   Result: `(-1 * -7) / (2 * 4) = 7/8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
4.  **Final check:**
    `7/8 = 7/8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. The solution is confirmed correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

Humans have observed different substances and their properties for thousands of years, noting how they react with each other under various circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This long [[historical_evolution_and_significance_of_chemistry|historical evolution]] led to the natural question of how these substances are fundamentally structured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Atoms and Their Subatomic Particles

The most basic unit of any substance that still retains the properties of that substance is called an [[Elements and their basic units atoms|element]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. For example, carbon, lead, and gold are [[Elements and their basic units atoms|elements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. The most fundamental unit of any of these [[Elements and their basic units atoms|elements]] is the [[Elements and their basic units atoms|atom]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

Atoms themselves are comprised of even more fundamental particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. These fundamental particles and their arrangement define an [[Elements and their basic units atoms|element]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Changing the number of these particles can alter an [[Elements and their basic units atoms|element's]] properties or even transform it into a different [[Elements and their basic units atoms|element]] entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. The three primary subatomic particles are:

*   **Protons**: Positively charged particles that define the [[Elements and their basic units atoms|element]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. The number of protons is known as the atomic number, which is how [[Elements and their basic units atoms|elements]] are ordered in the [[Role of periodic table in chemistry|Periodic Table of Elements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Neutrons**: Neutral particles found in the nucleus with protons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. The number of neutrons can vary for a given [[Elements and their basic units atoms|element]] (creating isotopes) without changing the [[Elements and their basic units atoms|element]]'s identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
*   **Electrons**: Negatively charged particles that surround the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

### The Role of Electrons

Electrons are crucial to understanding [[Introduction to chemical equations|chemistry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

*   **Location and Movement**: Electrons can be conceptualized as moving around or "buzzing around" the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. While often simplified as orbiting, their behavior is more complex and requires quantum physics for full understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   **Charge and Attraction**: Electrons have a negative charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. Protons have a positive charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. Unlike charges attract, which explains why electrons are attracted to and bound to the positively charged nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. Electrons' high velocity prevents them from simply falling into the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.
*   **Neutral Atoms**: In a neutral [[Elements and their basic units atoms|atom]], the number of electrons is equal to the number of protons, balancing out the charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. For instance, neutral carbon-12 has six protons and six electrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   **Variability**: Unlike protons, the number of electrons in an [[Elements and their basic units atoms|atom]] can change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. This change is fundamental to [[Introduction to chemical equations|chemistry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.
    *   **Interaction and Exchange**: Electrons can interact with other electrons, or be taken away by other atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
    *   **Charge Imbalance**: If an [[Elements and their basic units atoms|atom]] loses an electron, it will have fewer electrons than protons, resulting in a net positive charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.
    *   **Chemical Properties**: An [[Elements and their basic units atoms|atom]]'s properties and how it reacts, bonds, or repels other atoms depend heavily on the number and configuration of its electrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. Different [[Elements and their basic units atoms|elements]] have varying affinities for electrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

Understanding the behavior of electrons is key to predicting how [[Elements and their basic units atoms|elements]] will interact and form compounds, a central concept in [[Introduction to chemical equations|chemistry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

The P-value, or [[probability_in_inferential_statistics | probability]] value, is a crucial concept in [[mean_and_standard_deviation_in_hypothesis_testing | hypothesis testing]] used to determine the strength of evidence against a [[null_hypothesis_and_alternative_hypothesis | null hypothesis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. It quantifies the likelihood of observing data as extreme as, or more extreme than, the collected data, assuming the [[null_hypothesis_and_alternative_hypothesis | null hypothesis]] is true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Setting Up Hypotheses

When conducting a test, two main hypotheses are established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>:

*   **[[null_hypothesis_and_alternative_hypothesis | Null Hypothesis]] (H₀)**: This hypothesis represents the status quo or the assumption that there is no effect or no difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. For example, if testing a drug's effect on rat response time, the [[null_hypothesis_and_alternative_hypothesis | null hypothesis]] would state that the drug has no effect, meaning the mean response time remains the same as without the drug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **[[null_hypothesis_and_alternative_hypothesis | Alternative Hypothesis]] (H₁ or Hₐ)**: This hypothesis suggests that there is an effect or a difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. In the drug example, the [[null_hypothesis_and_alternative_hypothesis | alternative hypothesis]] would state that the drug does have an effect, meaning the mean response time is not equal to the original mean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

The goal of [[mean_and_standard_deviation_in_hypothesis testing | hypothesis testing]] is to determine whether there is enough evidence to reject the [[null_hypothesis_and_alternative_hypothesis | null hypothesis]] in favor of the [[null_hypothesis_and_alternative_hypothesis | alternative hypothesis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Calculating the P-value

To calculate the P-value, one assumes the [[null_hypothesis_and_alternative_hypothesis | null hypothesis]] is true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The process involves:

1.  **Defining the Sampling Distribution**: If the [[null_hypothesis_and_alternative_hypothesis | null hypothesis]] is true, the sampling distribution of the sample means will be normally distributed around the hypothesized population mean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Its mean will be the population mean assumed by the [[null_hypothesis_and_alternative_hypothesis | null hypothesis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
2.  **Calculating the Standard Error**: The standard deviation of the sampling distribution (standard error) is calculated by dividing the population standard deviation by the square root of the sample size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. If the population standard deviation is unknown, it can be estimated using the sample standard deviation, especially for large sample sizes (e.g., > 100) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
3.  **Determining the [[use_of_zstatistic_in_inferential_statistics | Z-statistic]]**: The [[use_of_zstatistic_in_inferential_statistics | Z-statistic]] (or [[zscore_and_sampling_distribution | Z-score]]) measures how many standard deviations the observed sample mean is from the hypothesized population mean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
    *   For a study on rats injected with a drug, with a known mean response time of 1.2 seconds for untreated rats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, a sample of 100 injected rats had a mean response time of 1.05 seconds with a sample standard deviation of 0.5 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
    *   Assuming the [[null_hypothesis_and_alternative_hypothesis | null hypothesis]] (drug has no effect), the sampling distribution mean is 1.2 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
    *   The standard error (estimated) is 0.5 (sample standard deviation) / sqrt(100) (sample size) = 0.5 / 10 = 0.05 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
    *   The [[use_of_zstatistic_in_inferential_statistics | Z-statistic]] for the observed sample mean of 1.05 seconds is (1.2 - 1.05) / 0.05 = 0.15 / 0.05 = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. This means the observed sample mean is 3 standard deviations below the hypothesized mean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
4.  **Finding the [[calculating_probability_using_zscore | Probability]]**: The P-value is the [[calculating_probability_using_zscore | probability]] of obtaining a result as extreme as or more extreme than the observed [[use_of_zstatistic_in_inferential_statistics | Z-statistic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. For a two-tailed test, this includes both tails of the distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
    *   Based on the empirical rule, approximately 99.7% of data falls within 3 standard deviations of the mean in a normal distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
    *   Therefore, the [[calculating_probability_using_zscore | probability]] of a result being *more extreme* than 3 standard deviations (i.e., less than -3 or greater than +3) is 100% - 99.7% = 0.3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
    *   The P-value in this case is 0.003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

## Interpreting the P-value

A small P-value suggests that the observed results are unlikely if the [[null_hypothesis_and_alternative_hypothesis | null hypothesis]] were true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. This provides evidence to reject the [[null_hypothesis_and_alternative_hypothesis | null hypothesis]] in favor of the [[null_hypothesis_and_alternative_hypothesis | alternative hypothesis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

*   In the example, a P-value of 0.003 means there is only a 0.3% chance (less than 1 in 300) of observing such an extreme result if the drug had no effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. This is considered a very strong indicator that the [[null_hypothesis_and_alternative_hypothesis | null hypothesis]] is incorrect, suggesting the drug does have an effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.
*   Commonly, a threshold (significance level, often denoted as α) is set for the P-value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. If the P-value is less than this threshold, the [[null_hypothesis_and_alternative_hypothesis | null hypothesis]] is rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. A common threshold is 5% (0.05), meaning if there's less than a 1 in 20 chance of the result occurring under the [[null_hypothesis_and_alternative_hypothesis | null hypothesis]], it is rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

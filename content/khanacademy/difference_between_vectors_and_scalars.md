The [[difference between vectors and scalars | difference between vectors and scalars]] lies in whether a quantity includes a direction in addition to a magnitude, or size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Definitions

*   A [[definition of vectors | vector]] is a quantity that possesses both a magnitude (or size) and a direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   A [[definition of scalars | scalar]] is a quantity that possesses only a magnitude (or size) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

While these ideas might initially sound complicated, they are quite simple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Understanding them becomes clearer through [[examples of vectors and scalars in motion | examples]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Examples in Motion

### Distance vs. Displacement

Consider moving a brick 5 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

*   **Distance (Scalar)**: If you are only told the brick moved "5 meters," you know the size or magnitude of the movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. This is a [[definition of scalars | scalar]] quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. When referring to how much something has changed position without giving direction, this is called [[examples of vectors and scalars in motion | distance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. You wouldn't know if it moved to the right, left, up, or down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
    *   Example: The brick moved a [[examples of vectors and scalars in motion | distance]] of 5 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

*   **Displacement (Vector)**: If you specify that the brick moved "5 meters to the right," you have provided both the magnitude (5 meters) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a> and the direction (to the right) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. This is a [[definition of vectors | vector]] quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. The vector version of [[examples of vectors and scalars in motion | distance]], which includes direction, is called [[examples of vectors and scalars in motion | displacement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
    *   Example: The brick has been [[examples of vectors and scalars in motion | displaced]] 5 meters to the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

### Speed vs. Velocity

Let's say the brick moved 5 meters in 2 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This means it moved at 2.5 meters per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

*   **Speed (Scalar)**: If you are told the brick moved at "2.5 meters per second," you know how fast it went (its magnitude) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>, but no direction is given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. This is a [[definition of scalars | scalar]] quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. The scalar quantity for how fast something is going is [[examples of vectors and scalars in motion | speed]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
    *   Example: The [[examples of vectors and scalars in motion | speed]] of the brick is 2.5 meters per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

*   **Velocity (Vector)**: If you say the brick moved "2.5 meters per second to the right," you are giving both the magnitude (2.5 meters per second) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a> and the direction (to the right) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. This is a [[definition of vectors | vector]] quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. When both [[examples of vectors and scalars in motion | speed]] and direction are specified, you are talking about [[examples of vectors and scalars in motion | velocity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. This illustrates the [[difference between speed and velocity | difference between speed and velocity]].

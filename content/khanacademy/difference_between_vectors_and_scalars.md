Vectors and scalars are fundamental concepts in mathematics and physics, though they might initially seem complex. They are, in fact, quite simple ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The key distinction lies in whether a quantity includes a direction.

## Definitions

*   A **vector** is a quantity that possesses both a magnitude (or size) and a direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   A **scalar** is a quantity that possesses only a magnitude (or size) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Examples

To illustrate these concepts, consider the following [[examples_of_vectors_and_scalars | examples]]:

### Distance vs. Displacement

Imagine moving a brick on the ground. If you pick up a brick and move it, and then measure that it has moved 5 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>:

*   **Distance (Scalar):** If you are only told that the brick moved 5 meters, you know the size or magnitude of the movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. This is a scalar quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. **[[distance_vs_displacement | Distance]]** refers to how much something has changed its position without specifying direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Without a direction, you wouldn't know if it moved 5 meters to the left, right, up, or down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

*   **Displacement (Vector):** If you specify that the brick moved "5 meters to the right," you are providing both the magnitude (5 meters) and the direction (to the right) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. This is a vector quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The vector version of distance, which includes direction, is called **[[distance_vs_displacement | displacement]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

    > The brick has been displaced 5 meters to the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
    > The brick has moved a distance of 5 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### Speed vs. Velocity

Consider the previous example where the brick moved 5 meters to the right in 2 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

*   **Time (Scalar):** In simple physics, time is generally considered to move only in the positive direction, making it a scalar quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

*   **Speed (Scalar):** If you calculate how fast the brick moved, you divide the distance by the time: 5 meters / 2 seconds = 2.5 meters per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. This value tells you how fast it went but does not include a direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Therefore, 2.5 meters per second is a scalar quantity, known as **speed** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

*   **Velocity (Vector):** If you include the direction with the speed, such as "2.5 meters per second to the right," you are specifying both the magnitude (2.5 meters per second) and the direction (to the right) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. This makes it a vector quantity, known as **velocity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

### Summary of Differences

| Quantity     | Vector (Magnitude + Direction)                        | Scalar (Magnitude Only)                          |
| :----------- | :---------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| **Movement** | [[distance_vs_displacement | Displacement]] (e.g., 5 meters to the right) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a> | [[distance_vs_displacement | Distance]] (e.g., 5 meters) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a> |
| **Rate**     | Velocity (e.g., 2.5 m/s to the right) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>     | Speed (e.g., 2.5 m/s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>   |

In essence, if you need to specify the orientation or path of something, you're likely dealing with a vector. If only the amount or size matters, it's a scalar.

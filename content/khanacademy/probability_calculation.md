Probability is a way of measuring the likelihood that something is going to happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. It quantifies how many of the outcomes from a given trial meet specific constraints or satisfy a particular event, relative to the total number of possible outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Key Terms in Probability

*   **Event**
    The "event in question" refers to the specific outcome you are interested in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. For example, picking a yellow marble is an event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
*   **Trial**
    A trial is the action or experiment being performed, such as picking a marble out of a bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   **Possible Outcomes / Sample Space**
    The set of all possible outcomes from a trial is sometimes referred to as the "sample space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This represents every potential result that could occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Calculating Probability

To calculate the probability of an event, you consider two main components:
1.  **Number of outcomes that satisfy the event**: How many outcomes meet your specific criteria or constraint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
2.  **Number of possible outcomes**: The total number of unique results that could occur in the trial, also known as the size of the sample space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

The probability (often denoted as 'p') is then calculated as:

```
P(Event) = (Number of outcomes satisfying the event) / (Total number of possible outcomes)
```

### [[marble_probability_example | Marble Probability Example]]

Consider a bag containing marbles with the following distribution:
*   3 yellow marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>
*   2 red marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>
*   2 green marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>
*   1 blue marble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>

The goal is to find the probability of pulling a yellow marble from this bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

1.  **Identify the event**: The event is picking a yellow marble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.
2.  **Determine outcomes satisfying the event**: There are 3 yellow marbles in the bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. So, 3 outcomes will allow this event to occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
3.  **Determine the total possible outcomes (sample space)**:
    *   3 yellow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>
    *   2 red <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
    *   2 green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>
    *   1 blue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>
    The total number of marbles is 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 8 marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Thus, there are 8 possible outcomes when picking one marble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

Therefore, the probability of picking a yellow marble is:
P(Yellow) = (Number of yellow marbles) / (Total number of marbles)
P(Yellow) = 3 / 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>

This calculation is a straightforward way to understand the likelihood of an event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

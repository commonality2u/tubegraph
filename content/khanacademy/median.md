The median is a statistical [[measures_of_central_tendency|measure of central tendency]] that represents the middle number in a data set [00:05:21]. When seeking a typical, middle, or central number to describe data, the median is one of several types of averages [00:02:18], [00:05:04].

## [[Calculating the median | Calculating the Median]]

To find the median of a set of numbers, you must first order all the numbers in the set [00:05:25].

### For an Even Number of Data Points
If there is an even number of data points, there isn't one single middle number [00:05:52]. In this case, there will be two middle numbers [00:05:57]. The median is found by going halfway between these two numbers [00:06:05], essentially taking the [[arithmetic_mean|arithmetic mean]] of the two middle numbers [00:06:09].

For example, given the plant heights: 4, 3, 1, 6, 1, 7 inches [00:01:07].
1.  Order the data set: 1, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7 [00:05:38].
2.  Identify the two middle numbers: 3 and 4 [00:06:02].
3.  Calculate the median: Halfway between 3 and 4 is 3.5 [00:06:14]. Therefore, the median is 3.5 [00:06:19].

### For an Odd Number of Data Points
If there is an odd number of data points, it is easier to identify the median, as there will be a single number exactly in the middle [00:06:31]. This middle number will be greater than an equal number of values below it and less than an equal number of values above it [00:07:07].

For example, given the data set: 0, 7, 50, 10,000, 1,000,000 [00:06:41].
1.  The data set is already ordered [00:06:39].
2.  There are five numbers, which is an odd number [00:07:02].
3.  The middle number is 50, as it has two numbers less than it (0, 7) and two numbers greater than it (10,000, 1,000,000) [00:07:07].
4.  Therefore, the median is 50 [00:07:14].

## Utility of the Median
The median is a useful [[central_tendency_in_statistics | measure of central tendency]] alongside the [[arithmetic_mean|arithmetic mean]] and mode, each serving different purposes [00:08:23]. The median is particularly effective when a data set contains extreme values or outliers, as these "crazy numbers" can "skew the [[arithmetic_mean|arithmetic mean]]" [00:08:31]. The median, being based on position, is less affected by these extreme values, providing a more representative "middle" value in such cases.

The [[Understanding the median | median]] is one of several [[measures of central tendency | measures of central tendency]], which are ways to describe a typical or middle number in a dataset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. It serves as a way to find a representative number for a set of data, especially when asked for a single number to describe the "middle" or "typical" value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

## Calculating the Median

To find the [[Understanding the median | median]], you must first order all the numbers in the dataset from least to greatest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>. Once ordered, the [[Understanding the median | median]] is literally the middle number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.

### For an Even Number of Data Points

If a dataset has an even number of data points, there isn't one single middle number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. Instead, there will be two middle numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. To find the [[Understanding the median | median]] in this case, you take the [[Arithmetic mean | arithmetic mean]] (average) of these two middle numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>.

**Example:**
Consider the plant heights: 4, 3, 1, 6, 1, 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.
1.  Order the numbers: 1, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>.
2.  There are six numbers, so the two middle numbers are 3 and 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>.
3.  Calculate the [[Arithmetic mean | arithmetic mean]] of 3 and 4: (3 + 4) / 2 = 7 / 2 = 3.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>.
    *   The [[Understanding the median | median]] for this dataset is 3.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>.

### For an Odd Number of Data Points

If a dataset has an odd number of data points, it is simpler to compute because there will be one exact middle number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>. This middle number is the value that has an equal number of data points above and below it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>.

**Example:**
Consider the dataset: 0, 7, 50, 10,000, 1,000,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>.
1.  The numbers are already ordered.
2.  There are five numbers, making it an odd set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>.
3.  The middle number is 50, as two numbers (0, 7) are less than it and two numbers (10,000, 1,000,000) are greater than it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>.
    *   The [[Understanding the median | median]] for this dataset is 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>.

## When to Use the Median

The [[Understanding the median | median]] is particularly useful when a dataset contains "crazy numbers" or outliers that might skew the [[Arithmetic mean | arithmetic mean]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>. In such cases, the [[Understanding the median | median]] provides a more robust representation of the [[Central tendency | central tendency]] as it is less affected by extreme values than the [[Arithmetic mean | arithmetic mean]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>.

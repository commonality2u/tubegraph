[[understanding_absolute_value | Absolute value inequalities]] can be confusing, but by remembering what [[understanding_absolute_value | absolute value]] signifies—distance from zero—they become more intuitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Visualizing the problem on a number line is key to avoiding memorized rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## Basic Absolute Value Inequalities

### Case 1: Less Than (<) or Less Than or Equal To (<=)

When an [[understanding_absolute_value | absolute value]] is *less than* a number, it means the expression inside is *less than that distance away from zero* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

**Example: `|x| < 12`**
This inequality asks for all `x` values that are less than 12 units away from zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

1.  **Visualize on a Number Line:**
    On a number line, numbers less than 12 units from zero fall between -12 and 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
    ```
    <-----|------------|----|----|------------|----->
         -12          -6    0    6           12
    ```
2.  **Convert to Compound Inequality:**
    The values of `x` must be greater than -12 AND less than 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
    `x > -12` AND `x < 12`
    This can be written as a single compound inequality: `-12 < x < 12` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
3.  **[[interval_notation_in_solving_inequalities | Interval Notation]]:**
    The solution set is `(-12, 12)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

### Case 2: Greater Than (>) or Greater Than or Equal To (>=)

When an [[understanding_absolute_value | absolute value]] is *greater than* a number, it means the expression inside is *more than that distance away from zero* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

**Example: `|7x| >= 21`**
This means that `7x` must be 21 or more units away from zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

1.  **Visualize on a Number Line:**
    Numbers 21 or more units from zero are either 21 or greater, or -21 or less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
    ```
    <-----|------------|----|----|------------|----->
         -21                0                   21
    ```
    Any number less than or equal to -21 will have an [[understanding_absolute_value | absolute value]] greater than 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. Similarly, any number greater than or equal to 21 will have an [[understanding_absolute_value | absolute value]] greater than 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

2.  **Convert to Two Separate Inequalities:**
    *   `7x <= -21` (meaning `7x` is in the range less than or equal to -21) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>
    *   OR `7x >= 21` (meaning `7x` is in the range greater than or equal to 21) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>

3.  **[[solving_simple_linear_equations | Solve Each Inequality]]:**
    *   For `7x <= -21`: Divide both sides by 7 to get `x <= -3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
    *   For `7x >= 21`: Divide both sides by 7 to get `x >= 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

4.  **[[visualizing_inequalities_on_a_number_line | Visualize the Solution Set]]:**
    The solution consists of two disjoint intervals:
    ```
    <-----|----]------------|------------[----->
         -3                0                   3
    ```
    In [[interval_notation_in_solving_inequalities | interval notation]], this is `(-inf, -3] U [3, inf)`.

## More Complex Absolute Value Inequalities

The same principles apply when the expression inside the [[understanding_absolute_value | absolute value]] is more complex.

### Example: `|5x + 3| < 7`

This means `5x + 3` must be less than 7 units away from zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

1.  **Convert to Compound Inequality:**
    The expression `5x + 3` must be greater than -7 AND less than 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
    `-7 < 5x + 3 < 7`
2.  **[[solving_algebraic_equations | Solve for x]]:**
    To [[solving_algebraic_equations | isolate x]], perform operations on all three parts of the inequality.
    *   Subtract 3 from all parts:
        `-7 - 3 < 5x + 3 - 3 < 7 - 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>
        `-10 < 5x < 4`
    *   Divide all parts by 5:
        `-10 / 5 < 5x / 5 < 4 / 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>
        `-2 < x < 4/5`

3.  **Solution Set:**
    The solution is all `x` values greater than -2 and less than 4/5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
    In [[interval_notation_in_solving_inequalities | interval notation]]: `(-2, 4/5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

### Example: `|2x/7 + 9| > 5/7`

This means `2x/7 + 9` must be more than 5/7 units away from zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

1.  **Convert to Two Separate Inequalities:**
    *   `2x/7 + 9 > 5/7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>
    *   OR `2x/7 + 9 < -5/7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>

2.  **[[solving_algebraic_equations | Solve Each Inequality]]:**
    To simplify, multiply both sides of each inequality by 7 to clear the denominators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

    *   **For `2x/7 + 9 > 5/7`:**
        *   Multiply by 7: `2x + 63 > 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>
        *   Subtract 63: `2x > 5 - 63`
        *   `2x > -58` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>
        *   Divide by 2: `x > -29` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>

    *   **For `2x/7 + 9 < -5/7`:**
        *   Multiply by 7: `2x + 63 < -5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>
        *   Subtract 63: `2x < -5 - 63`
        *   `2x < -68` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>
        *   Divide by 2: `x < -34` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>

3.  **[[visualizing_inequalities_on_a_number_line | Visualize the Solution Set]]:**
    The solution is all `x` values greater than -29 OR less than -34 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.
    ```
    <-----|----)------------|------------(----->
         -34               -29
    ```
    In [[interval_notation_in_solving_inequalities | interval notation]]: `(-inf, -34) U (-29, inf)`.

## General Rules/Patterns

While memorization is discouraged, these patterns derive directly from the meaning of [[understanding_absolute_value | absolute value]]:

*   **If `|f(x)| < a` (where `a > 0`):**
    This means `f(x)` is less than `a` units from 0.
    It translates to: `-a < f(x) < a` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

*   **If `|f(x)| > a` (where `a > 0`):**
    This means `f(x)` is more than `a` units from 0.
    It translates to: `f(x) < -a` OR `f(x) > a` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

The key is to understand that these rules are merely shorthand for visualizing distances on a number line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

The word "algebra" and many of the ideas it represents today originate from a book written by a Persian mathematician named Al-Khwarizmi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This significant work is titled "The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Al-Khwarizmi wrote it in Baghdad around 820 AD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Origin of the Term "Algebra"

The term "algebra" comes directly from the Arabic word "Al-gabr" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. In Arabic, "algebra" means "restoration" or "completion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Al-Khwarizmi associated this term with the specific operation of moving elements from one side of an equation to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

The full Arabic title of the book, "Al-kitab al-mukhtasar fihisab al-gabr wa'l-muqabala," can be broken down:
*   "Al-kitab" means "book" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   "Al-mukhtasar" is understood to mean "compendious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   "Fihisab" means "calculation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   "Al-gabr" signifies "completion" or "restoration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   "Wa'l-muqabala" translates to "balancing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

Thus, the title accurately reflects its English translation: "The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Contributions to Modern Algebra

Al-Khwarizmi's book is highly significant, not just for popularizing the word "algebra," but because many consider it the first time that algebra began to encompass many of its modern ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. These include concepts like balancing equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a> and approaching problems in an abstract manner, rather than as isolated, one-off cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

## Place in the [[historical_timeline_of_algebra | Historical Timeline of Algebra]]

While Al-Khwarizmi is often credited as a pivotal figure, the [[origins_of_algebra | origins of algebra]] predate his work significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. The earliest known exploration of algebraic ideas dates back to ancient Babylon around 2000 BCE, evidenced by stone tablets that reveal fundamental algebraic concepts, albeit without modern symbols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

Key figures who made [[historical_timeline_of_algebra | major contributions to algebra]] before Al-Khwarizmi include:
*   **[[contributions_of_diophantus | Diophantus]]** (200-300 AD): A Greek mathematician from Alexandria, sometimes considered the "father of algebra" by Western historians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. His work focused more on specific problems compared to Al-Khwarizmi's more abstract approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   **[[brahmaguptas_influence_on_algebra | Brahmagupta]]** (circa 600 AD): An Indian mathematician who also made significant contributions to the field of algebra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

Al-Khwarizmi, located in Baghdad around the 8th or 9th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, is largely credited with formalizing algebra as an abstract field of study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. While some debate whether he or [[contributions_of_diophantus | Diophantus]] is the "father of algebra," Al-Khwarizmi is undeniably a key figure due to his systematization and abstract treatment of algebraic concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

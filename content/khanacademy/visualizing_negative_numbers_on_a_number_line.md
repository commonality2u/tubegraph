Initially, [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negative numbers]] might appear complex or mysterious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. While counting often begins with positive numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, negative numbers are a common part of everyday life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Fundamentally, a [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negative number]] is any number less than zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Understanding Negative Numbers in Context

[[understanding_the_concept_of_negative_numbers_in_real_life_scenarios | Real-life examples]] help clarify the meaning of negative numbers:

### Temperature
Temperature is a clear example where negative numbers are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. For instance, if the temperature is 3 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a> and drops by 4 degrees:
*   A drop of 1 degree leads to 2 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   A drop of 2 degrees leads to 1 degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   A drop of 3 degrees leads to 0 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   To complete the 4-degree drop, the temperature goes one more degree below 0, reaching negative 1 (-1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

### Bank Account Balance
A bank account balance is another relatable example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. If you have $10 in your account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a> and spend $30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>, assuming the bank allows you to spend more than you have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>:
*   You will owe the bank money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   The difference of $20 must come from the bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, meaning your balance becomes negative $20 (-$20) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   A negative balance signifies that you owe money rather than possessing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

## Visualizing Negative Numbers on a Number Line

The number line is a powerful tool for [[graphical_representation_of_inequalities | visualizing inequalities]] and understanding [[how_to_add_and_subtract_negative_numbers | how to add and subtract negative numbers]].
*   Numbers increase in positive value as you move to the right of zero on the number line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   Numbers become more negative as you move to the left of zero: -1, -2, -3, and so on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   It's important to note that a larger negative number (e.g., -3) is *less than* a smaller negative number (e.g., -1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. For example, -100 is much smaller than -1, indicating a greater "lack" of something, like heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

When performing operations:
*   Subtracting or getting colder means moving to the left on the number line, making numbers smaller than zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   Adding or receiving a paycheck means moving to the right on the number line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

## Adding and Subtracting Negative Numbers with a Number Line

Using the number line helps visualize [[adding_negative_numbers | adding]] and [[subtracting_negative_numbers | subtracting]] [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negative numbers]].

### Subtraction Examples
When subtracting, move to the left on the number line:

*   **3 - 4**:
    *   Start at 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.
    *   Move 4 units to the left (1, 2, 3, 4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
    *   This takes you to -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   **2 - 8**:
    *   Start at 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.
    *   Move 8 units to the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
    *   Moving 2 units left reaches 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
    *   You still need to move 6 more units to the left (8 - 2 = 6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
    *   Counting 6 units left from 0 brings you to -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
    *   So, 2 - 8 = -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   **-4 - 2**:
    *   Start at -4 on the number line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
    *   Subtracting 2 means moving 2 units further to the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
    *   Moving 1 unit left from -4 reaches -5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
    *   Moving another 1 unit left reaches -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
    *   Therefore, -4 - 2 = -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

### Addition Example
When adding, move to the right on the number line:

*   **-3 + 2**:
    *   Start at -3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
    *   Adding 2 means moving 2 units to the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
    *   Moving 1 unit right reaches -2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
    *   Moving another 1 unit right reaches -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
    *   So, -3 + 2 = -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

Visualizing these operations on a number line provides an intuitive understanding of working with negative numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Future lessons will delve deeper into more complex operations, such as the [[concept_of_subtracting_a_negative_number | concept of subtracting a negative number]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

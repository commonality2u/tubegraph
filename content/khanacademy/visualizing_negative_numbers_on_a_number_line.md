When first encountered, [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negative numbers]] can appear deep and mysterious, especially since initial counting typically involves positive numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. However, [[realworld_examples_of_negative_numbers | negative numbers]] are commonly encountered in everyday life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Fundamentally, a [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negative number]] is any number less than zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Real-World Contexts for Negative Numbers

### Temperature
When measuring temperature, such as in Celsius, [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negative numbers]] describe coldness below zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. For instance, if the temperature is 3 degrees Celsius and it gets 4 degrees colder, the temperature drops to -1 degree Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
A temperature of -3 degrees is colder than -1 degree, indicating less heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This highlights that -100 is much smaller than -1, representing a greater lack of heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Bank Accounts
In a bank account, a [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negative number]] signifies debt or owing money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. If you have $10 and spend $30, your account balance becomes -$20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. This means you owe the bank $20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

## The [[Concept of number line in mathematics | Number Line]]
The [[concept_of_number_line_in_mathematics | number line]] is a crucial tool for understanding [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negative numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   Numbers increase in positive value as you move to the right of 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   Numbers become more negative (smaller) as you move to the left of 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. For example, -1, -2, -3, and so on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   When performing operations, moving to the left indicates subtraction or getting colder/losing value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Moving to the right indicates addition or gaining value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

## [[Arithmetic examples with negative numbers | Arithmetic Examples]] Using a [[Number line visualization | Number Line Visualization]]

To [[using_a_number_line_for_arithmetic | add and subtract negative numbers]], it is highly recommended to [[number_line_visualization | visualize the number line]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

### Subtracting from a Positive Number
*   **3 - 4**:
    *   Start at 3 on the [[concept_of_number_line_in_mathematics | number line]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.
    *   Subtracting 4 means moving 4 units to the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
    *   Moving 3 units left reaches 0. Moving 1 more unit left results in -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
    *   Result: -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

*   **2 - 8**:
    *   Start at 2 on the [[concept_of_number_line_in_mathematics | number line]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.
    *   Subtracting 8 means moving 8 units to the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
    *   Moving 2 units left reaches 0. You still need to move 6 more units left (8 - 2 = 6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
    *   Moving 6 units left from 0 reaches -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
    *   Result: -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

### Subtracting from a Negative Number
*   **-4 - 2**:
    *   Start at -4 on the [[concept_of_number_line_in_mathematics | number line]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
    *   Subtracting 2 means moving 2 units further to the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
    *   Moving 1 unit left reaches -5. Moving another 1 unit left reaches -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
    *   Result: -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

### [[Adding negative numbers | Adding to a Negative Number]]
*   **-3 + 2**:
    *   Start at -3 on the [[concept_of_number_line_in_mathematics | number line]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
    *   Adding 2 means moving 2 units to the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
    *   Moving 1 unit right reaches -2. Moving another 1 unit right reaches -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
    *   Result: -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

Understanding these movements on the [[number_line_visualization | number line]] helps grasp the concept of [[adding_and_subtracting_negative_numbers | adding and subtracting negative numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

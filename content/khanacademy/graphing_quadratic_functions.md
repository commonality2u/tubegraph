[[Quadratic equations | Quadratic equations]] can be graphed to visually determine their roots or zeroes, which are the points where the function intersects the x-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The [[quadratic_equations | quadratic formula]] is used to [[solving_quadratic_equations | solve for these roots algebraically]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

A general [[understanding_quadratic_expressions | quadratic equation]] is in the form `ax² + bx + c = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. In this form:
*   `a` is the coefficient of the `x²` term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   `b` is the coefficient of the `x` term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   `c` is the constant term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Visualizing Solutions to Quadratic Equations

When graphing a [[quadratic_equations | quadratic equation]], the points where the graph intersects the x-axis represent the solutions (or roots) to the equation when y = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

### No Real Solutions

If the part of the [[quadratic_equations | quadratic formula]] under the square root, `b² - 4ac` (known as the discriminant), is negative, the equation will have no real solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. In such cases, the graph of the [[quadratic_equations | quadratic function]] will not intersect the x-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

For example, for the equation `3x² + 6x + 10 = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>:
*   `a = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>
*   `b = 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>
*   `c = 10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>

Plugging these values into the discriminant `b² - 4ac` gives `6² - 4(3)(10) = 36 - 120 = -84` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. Since the result is negative, there are no real solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. When graphed, the [[vertex_of_a_quadratic_function | vertex]] of this quadratic function is above the x-axis, and since `a` is positive, it opens upwards, meaning it never crosses the x-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

### Real Solutions

If the discriminant `b² - 4ac` is positive, the equation will have two distinct real solutions, meaning the graph will intersect the x-axis at two different points. If the discriminant is zero, there will be exactly one real solution (a repeated root), and the graph will touch the x-axis at exactly one point (its [[vertex_of_a_quadratic_function | vertex]]).

In economic analysis, the term "ceteris paribus" is used to signify that "all other things are equal" or "all other things being held equal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. It is a fundamental assumption that allows economists to isolate the effect of one variable on another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Meaning and Origin

The term "ceteris paribus" is Latin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   "Ceteris" means "all other things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, related to "et cetera" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   "Paribus" means "equal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

Therefore, "ceteris paribus" literally translates to "all other things equal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Application in Economic Scenarios

When analyzing different scenarios, economists often assume "ceteris paribus" to ensure that only the variable of interest is changing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

For example, in a hypothetical scenario involving a hunter-gatherer deciding between hunting rabbits and gathering berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>:

*   **Variables Held Equal**
    *   The total amount of time available for hunting or gathering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
    *   The amount of sleep or personal time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
    *   Techniques used for hunting or gathering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
    *   Geographical location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
    *   Tools or technology used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

*   **Variable Being Changed**
    *   The only variable being adjusted is the allocation of time between finding rabbits and finding berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

By maintaining "ceteris paribus," economists can observe the direct impact of changes in one variable, such as time allocation, on the outputs (number of rabbits vs. berries) without confounding factors distorting the results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This principle is crucial for constructing models like the production possibilities frontier, which illustrates the trade-offs between two goods when resources are fully utilized under stable conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

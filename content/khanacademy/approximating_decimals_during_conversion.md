When [[converting_fractions_to_decimals | converting a fraction into a decimal]], it's common to encounter decimals that do not terminate. In such cases, methods for approximation become necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

## Identifying Repeating Decimals

Some fractions, when converted to decimals, result in a pattern of numbers that repeats indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. These are known as [[Repeating decimals as rational numbers | repeating decimals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

### Examples of Repeating Decimals

*   **1/3 as a decimal:**
    When dividing 1 by 3, the result is 0.3333... where the '3' repeats forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **17/9 as a decimal:**
    This [[dealing_with_whole_numbers_in_fraction_calculations | improper fraction]] converts to 1.8888... where the '8' repeats indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

### Notation for Repeating Decimals

To represent a repeating decimal without writing an infinite number of digits, a line (or bar) is placed on top of the repeating number or pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This line signifies that the number pattern repeats indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

*   0.3333... can be written as 0.3 repeating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, or more commonly 0.33 repeating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   1.8888... can be written as 1.88 repeating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

## When to Approximate (Round)

While repeating decimals have an exact mathematical representation using the bar notation, it is often impractical to use an infinite sequence of numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. In practical applications or on exams, you may be instructed to round the decimal to a specific [[importance_of_decimal_points_in_precision | place value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

For instance, 17/9, which exactly equals 1.88 repeating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>, could be rounded to approximately 1.89 if rounding to the hundredths place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

Similarly, for fractions like 17/93, where the decimal sequence might continue without an obvious repeating pattern in the first few digits, an approximation is made by stopping the division at a certain point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. For example, 17/93 can be approximated as 0.182, with the understanding that the decimals would continue if the division were extended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

The immune system is broadly categorized into two main divisions: the nonspecific (or [[innate_immune_system|innate immune system]]) and the specific (or adaptive) immune system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. While the [[innate_immune_system|innate immune system]] acts as a general defense, the adaptive immune system is specialized and learns from exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Specific vs. Nonspecific Immunity

The [[innate_immune_system|innate immune system]] provides immediate, general protection. Its first line of defense includes [[barrier_defenses_in_nonspecific_immunity|physical barriers]] like skin, stomach acid, and the acidity of skin oils, which prevent pathogens from entering the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. If pathogens breach these [[barrier_defenses_in_nonspecific_immunity|first line barriers]], the [[innate_immune_system|innate immune system]]'s second line of defense involves nonspecific responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. These mechanisms, such as the [[inflammatory_response_overview|inflammatory response]] and [[Phagocytes and their role in immunity|phagocytes]], identify and neutralize threats without recognizing the specific type of virus, protein, or bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. They simply recognize something as "shady" and engulf or destroy it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. For example, they might target double-stranded DNA, which is characteristic of many viruses, without knowing the specific virus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

In contrast, the specific, or adaptive, immune system is considered a newer adaptation in evolution and is particularly developed in humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. It's based on prior exposure to specific pathogens, leading to resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## Components of the Adaptive Immune System

The main actors in the adaptive immune system are **lymphocytes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Both [[Phagocytes and their role in immunity|phagocytes]] (like dendritic cells, macrophages, and neutrophils) and lymphocytes are types of white blood cells, also known as leukocytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. While [[Phagocytes and their role in immunity|phagocytes]] are largely nonspecific, lymphocytes are highly specific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. The role of [[Phagocytes and their role in immunity|phagocytes]] in antigen presentation also plays a part in activating the specific immune system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

Lymphocytes are further divided into two primary types:

*   **B lymphocytes (B cells)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>
*   **T lymphocytes (T cells)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>

### Development of Lymphocytes

The names B and T derive from their development locations:
*   **B lymphocytes** were first identified in the bursa of Fabricius in birds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. In humans, B cells are produced and developed in the **bone marrow**, making "B" an easy way to remember their origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   **T lymphocytes** start in the bone marrow but mature and become functional in the **thymus** gland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

## Humoral Response

B lymphocytes primarily participate in the **[[Humoral vs cellmediated immune responses|humoral response]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. The term "humoral" refers to the fluids of the body, such as blood and lymph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

The [[Humoral vs cellmediated immune responses|humoral response]] is effective against pathogens that are *free-floating* in these bodily fluids, such as viruses or bacteria that have not yet infiltrated cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. If a virus or bacterium is circulating in the system's fluids, the [[Humoral vs cellmediated immune responses|humoral response]] can act against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

## Cell-Mediated Response

T lymphocytes are involved in the **[[Humoral vs cellmediated immune responses|cell-mediated response]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. This response targets cells that have already been infected by viruses or colonized by bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. When cells become infected and begin producing more pathogens, the [[Humoral vs cellmediated immune responses|cell-mediated response]] may lead to the killing of the infected host cell itself to prevent further spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. T lymphocytes include different classes, such as helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Helper T cells also play a role in amplifying and activating the [[Humoral vs cellmediated immune responses|humoral response]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

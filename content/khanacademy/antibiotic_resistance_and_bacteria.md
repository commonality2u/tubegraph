Bacteria are individual cells that are definitively living organisms, possessing metabolisms and mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. When they cause infections, they release toxins that can make you sick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Antibiotics are medications specifically designed to kill bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

## How Antibiotic Resistance Develops

The more frequently antibiotics are used, the higher the likelihood of selecting for antibiotic-resistant bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. This process is a direct demonstration of [[Natural selection and variation | natural selection]] in real time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

### The Role of Variation and Random Mutation
Within any large population of bacteria, there is natural [[Natural selection and variation | variation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. This means some bacteria will be slightly different from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. These differences arise from random changes or mutations in their DNA, which can happen frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. While most bacteria in a population might make you equally sick, a rare random change might lead to one becoming resistant to an antibiotic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

### Selection by Antibiotic Use
When antibiotics are used, especially unnecessarily, they effectively kill off the susceptible bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. This removes the competition for the rare, antibiotic-resistant bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. With their competition eliminated, these resistant bacteria can then replicate rapidly and become the dominant type in the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.

It is crucial to understand that this is not an active or intelligent process by the bacteria; they do not "design" themselves to resist antibiotics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. Instead, it is the environment (the presence of antibiotics) that "selects" for the already existing, randomly resistant variants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

### Superbugs
When a previously effective antibiotic becomes useless against a dominant strain of bacteria, it leads to what is commonly known as a "superbug" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. The reason it's a "superbug" is not because it designed itself, but because humans inadvertently eliminated its competition, allowing it to thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.

This continuous mutation of bacteria means that if antibiotics are used too heavily, selection will always favor the resistant strains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. Therefore, responsible use of antibiotics is vital to preserve their effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.

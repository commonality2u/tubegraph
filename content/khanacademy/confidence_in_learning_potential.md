The core belief underpinning effective learning is the conviction that anyone, regardless of their starting point, possesses the innate ability to learn anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Universal Starting Point
No individual is born with inherent intelligence; everyone begins at a baseline of zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. At birth, people cannot talk, walk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, or perform complex tasks like algebra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, reading, or riding a bike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Initially, nobody is proficient at anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. For instance, there was a period when Einstein could not count to ten, and Shakespeare had to learn the alphabet, just like everyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This highlights [[the_universality_of_learning | the universality of learning]] and the potential within every individual.

## The Nature of Learning
Humans are inherently "born to learn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. [[the_process_of_learning_and_growth | The process of learning and growth]] is incremental, with one idea building upon the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Even the most intricate and profound concepts in the universe are constructed from fundamental ideas that are accessible and understandable to anyone, anywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## The Role of Persistence and Failure
[[the_process_of_learning_and_growth | The journey of learning]] often involves stumbling, slipping, crawling, and falling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. There are moments of frustration and confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, where one struggles until a breakthrough occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Each incorrect answer contributes to strengthening the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. In this context, [[the_role_of_failure_in_learning | failing is simply another term for growing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Persistence is key to [[the_process_of_learning_and_growth | continued growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Embracing Your Potential
True learning involves a deep-seated belief that one will eventually master a concept, even if it hasn't clicked yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This unwavering conviction in one's capacity to learn anything is crucial, regardless of who or where you are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

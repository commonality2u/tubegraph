From: [[khanacademy]] <br/> 

Vasodilation is a key process that occurs during the [[inflammatory_response_symptoms | inflammatory response]], particularly at the site of an injury or infection. It involves the widening of blood vessels, specifically capillaries, which leads to several observable [[inflammatory_response_symptoms | symptoms]] of inflammation, such as redness, swelling, and heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This process is a crucial component of the body's [[innate_immune_system_and_its_components | immune system's]] initial "field of battle" against pathogens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Triggers of Vasodilation

When the skin or other tissues are breached, for example, by a puncture wound, several chemical messengers are released:
*   **Chemokines** Cells damaged by an intruder (like bacteria from a rusty nail) immediately release chemical messengers called chemokines into the interstitial fluid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. These small molecules signal that damage has occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   **Histamine** [[Role of mast cells and dendritic cells | Mast cells]], which are found near the skin and other interfaces with the outside world, can be activated by direct contact with the intruder, by chemokines, or by molecules released by the invading bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. Upon activation, mast cells release histamine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

Histamine is a primary actor in the [[inflammatory_response_symptoms | inflammatory response]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. It targets the endothelial cells that line the capillaries, causing them to separate from each other and the capillaries themselves to enlarge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. This process is specifically known as vasodilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

## Effects of Vasodilation

The vasodilation caused by histamine and other factors has several significant effects at the site of injury:
*   **Increased Blood Flow:** The capillaries become larger, allowing more fluid and blood, including [[role_of_phagocytes_in_the_immune_response | white blood cells]] and [[role_of_phagocytes_in_the_immune_response | red blood cells]], to collect in the affected area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. This increased blood flow contributes to the redness and heat commonly observed during inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Increased Capillary Permeability:** The walls of the capillaries become more porous as the endothelial cells separate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. This allows substances that normally couldn't easily pass through to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
*   **Fluid Accumulation (Swelling):** Due to increased blood flow and permeability, more fluid (called exudate) exits the capillaries and accumulates in the interstitial fluid surrounding the cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. This influx of fluid into the tissue leads to the characteristic swelling seen in inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

## Facilitating Immune Response

The changes induced by vasodilation are critical for the effective functioning of the [[innate_immune_system_and_its_components | immune system]] at the site of infection:
*   **Recruitment of Immune Cells:** Chemokines released by damaged cells act as attractants for immune cells, particularly [[role_of_phagocytes_in_the_immune_response | phagocytes]] like neutrophils (the most abundant type of [[role_of_phagocytes_in_the_immune_response | phagocyte]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. The increased space between capillary cells due to vasodilation allows these immune cells to exit the bloodstream and reach the site of infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
    *   **Marginalization:** [[Role of phagocytes in the immune response | Neutrophils]] and other white blood cells (like B-cells and T-cells) start to roll along and stick to the walls of the dilated capillaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
    *   **Diapedesis/Extravasation:** They then squeeze through the gaps in the capillary walls to enter the interstitial fluid, where they are needed to combat the pathogens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.
*   **Activation of Immune Components:** The congestion and fluid accumulation also bring other immune system components, like B-cells and T-cells, to the area for activation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. Furthermore, proteins of the [[involvement_of_the_complement_system | complement system]], normally inactive in the blood plasma, become activated during the [[inflammatory_response_symptoms | inflammatory response]], helping to kill invading pathogens in a non-specific manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

While the [[inflammatory_response_symptoms | symptoms]] of inflammation (redness, swelling, heat, pain) can be uncomfortable, they are a direct result of these [[cellular_mechanisms_of_inflammation | cellular mechanisms]] and represent the body's essential first line of defense against infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

This article explores the unique behaviors of [[basics_of_multiplication | multiplication]] when involving the numbers one and [[understanding_the_zeroproduct_property | zero]]. Understanding these properties is fundamental to building a strong mathematical foundation.

## Multiplication by One

When a number is [[basics_of_multiplication | multiplied]] by one, the result is always the original number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. This can be understood by thinking of [[multiplication_as_repeated_addition | multiplication]] as repeated addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### Understanding the Concept
*   **"Three 1's"**: If you consider 3 times 1, you can view this as "three 1's" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. This means adding 1 to itself three times: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
*   **"Three one time"**: Alternatively, 3 times 1 can be seen as "3 one time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. This means you simply have the number 3, once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

### Examples
*   3 times 1 equals 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.
*   1 times 3 equals 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.
*   100 times 1 is equal to 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
*   1 times 39 is equal to 39 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
*   A large number like 5,493,692 times 1 is equal to that same large number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

## Multiplication by Zero

When any number is [[basics_of_multiplication | multiplied]] by [[understanding_the_zeroproduct_property | zero]], the product is always [[understanding_the_zeroproduct_property | zero]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. This is distinct from addition with [[understanding_the_zeroproduct_property | zero]], where 3 plus 0 is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a> because nothing is added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

### Understanding the Concept
*   **"Zero four times"**: Consider 4 [[multiplication_as_repeated_addition | times]] [[understanding_the_zeroproduct_property | zero]]. This can be interpreted as having [[understanding_the_zeroproduct_property | zero]] four times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. Adding [[understanding_the_zeroproduct_property | zero]] to itself four times (0 + 0 + 0 + 0) results in [[understanding_the_zeroproduct_property | zero]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.
*   **"Four zero times"**: Alternatively, 4 [[multiplication_as_repeated_addition | times]] [[understanding_the_zeroproduct_property | zero]] can mean that the number 4 appears [[understanding_the_zeroproduct_property | zero]] times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. If you write 4 [[understanding_the_zeroproduct_property | zero]] times, you write nothing at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

### Examples
*   4 times 0 is 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.
*   0 plus 0 plus 0 plus 0 equals 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.
*   A large number like 5,493,692 times 0 is equal to 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.
*   0 times 17 is also 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

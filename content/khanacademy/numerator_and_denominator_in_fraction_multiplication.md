When [[multiplying_fractions | multiplying fractions]], the process for determining the new numerator and denominator is straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Calculating the Product's Numerator
The numerator of the product is found by multiplying the numerators of the fractions being multiplied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. For example, when multiplying 5/6 by 2/3, the new numerator is 5 times 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Calculating the Product's Denominator
Similarly, the denominator of the product is found by multiplying the denominators of the fractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. In the example of 5/6 times 2/3, the new denominator is 6 times 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

### Example
To multiply 5/6 times 2/3:
*   Multiply the numerators: 5 × 2 = 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   Multiply the denominators: 6 × 3 = 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   The product is 10/18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Simplifying the Product
After multiplying fractions, the resulting fraction can often be simplified.

### Simplifying After Multiplication
The product 10/18 is a correct answer, but it can be expressed in its lowest terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. To do this, look for common factors between the numerator and the denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Both 10 and 18 are divisible by 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

To [[simplifying_fractions_after_conversion | simplify 10/18]]:
*   Divide the numerator by 2: 10 ÷ 2 = 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   Divide the denominator by 2: 18 ÷ 2 = 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   The simplified product is 5/9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Simplifying Before Multiplication
It is also possible to simplify fractions by canceling common factors before performing the multiplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This can make the numbers smaller and easier to work with.

Consider 5/6 times 2/3:
1.  Identify common factors between any numerator and any denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. In this case, the numerator 2 and the denominator 6 are both divisible by 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
2.  Divide 2 by 2, which becomes 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
3.  Divide 6 by 2, which becomes 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
4.  Now, the problem becomes 5/3 times 1/3.
5.  Multiply the new numerators: 5 × 1 = 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
6.  Multiply the new denominators: 3 × 3 = 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
7.  The result is 5/9, the same as simplifying after multiplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

Both methods yield the same correct answer, but simplifying before multiplication can sometimes make the process of identifying common factors clearer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

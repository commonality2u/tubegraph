There are numerous ways to [[representation_of_linear_equations | represent a linear equation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. For instance, the equation `y = 2x + 3` can be rewritten as `negative 2x + y = 3` by subtracting `2x` from both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Another equivalent form is `y - 5 = 2(x - 1)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. All these forms are equivalent and can be derived from one another through algebraic operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

Despite the infinite ways to [[representation_of_linear_equations | represent a linear equation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, the form `y = 2x + 3` is particularly useful and is known as **slope-intercept form** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Identifying the Y-intercept

In [[slope_of_a_line_in_algebra | slope-intercept form]], it is very easy to determine the [[yintercept_and_slope_of_a_linear_equation | y-intercept]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. The [[yintercept_and_slope_of_a_linear_equation | y-intercept]] is the point where the line crosses the y-axis, which occurs when `x` is equal to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

For the equation `y = 2x + 3`:
*   If `x = 0`, then `y = 2(0) + 3`, which simplifies to `y = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   Thus, the [[yintercept_and_slope_of_a_linear_equation | y-intercept]] is the point `(0, 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

This makes the [[yintercept_and_slope_of_a_linear_equation | y-intercept]] readily identifiable directly from the equation's constant term when in slope-intercept form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

## Identifying the Slope

The term "slope-intercept form" also implies that the [[slope_of_a_straight_line | slope]] can be easily figured out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. The [[slope_of_a_straight_line | slope]] represents the [[finding_the_slope_of_a_line | change in y over change in x]] (often denoted as Δy/Δx) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

For the equation `y = 2x + 3`:
*   If `x` increases by 1 (Δx = 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>:
    *   When `x = 0`, `y = 3`.
    *   When `x = 1`, `y = 2(1) + 3 = 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. The change in y (Δy) is `5 - 3 = 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
    *   When `x = 2`, `y = 2(2) + 3 = 7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. The change in y (Δy) is `7 - 5 = 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   In this linear equation, for every one unit increase in `x`, `y` increases by two units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   Therefore, the [[slope_of_a_straight_line | slope]] (Δy/Δx) is `2/1 = 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

In [[slope_of_a_line_in_algebra | slope-intercept form]] (`y = mx + b`), the coefficient `m` (the number multiplying `x`) directly represents the [[slope_of_a_straight_line | slope]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. The constant `b` represents the [[yintercept_and_slope_of_a_linear_equation | y-intercept]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

## Graphing Linear Equations using Slope-Intercept Form

The [[graphical_representation_of_linear_equations | slope-intercept form]] simplifies [[graphing_linear_equations | graphing linear equations]] significantly.

### Example 1: `y = 2x + 3`
1.  **Plot the Y-intercept**: Start by plotting the [[yintercept_and_slope_of_a_linear_equation | y-intercept]], which is `(0, 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
2.  **Use the Slope to find another point**: The [[slope_of_a_straight_line | slope]] is 2, or `2/1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. This means for every 1 unit increase in `x` (run), `y` increases by 2 units (rise) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Starting from `(0, 3)`, move 1 unit right and 2 units up to reach the point `(1, 5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
3.  **Draw the line**: With these two points, you can draw the straight line representing the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

### Example 2: `y = -x + 2`
1.  **Identify Y-intercept**: The constant term is `2`, so the [[yintercept_and_slope_of_a_linear_equation | y-intercept]] is `(0, 2)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
2.  **Identify Slope**: The coefficient of `x` is `-1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. This means for every 1 unit increase in `x`, `y` decreases by 1 unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
3.  **Graph**: Plot `(0, 2)`. From there, move 1 unit right and 1 unit down to find another point, for example `(1, 1)`. Connect these points to draw the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

Slope-intercept form is often considered the easiest way to visualize the [[graphical_representation_of_linear_equations | graph of a linear equation]] because the [[yintercept_and_slope_of_a_linear_equation | y-intercept]] and [[slope_of_a_straight_line | slope]] are explicitly given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

The [[using_elimination_to_solve_equations | elimination method]] is a technique used to solve systems of linear equations by adding or subtracting the equations to eliminate one of the variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This method simplifies the system into a single equation with one variable, making it solvable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## How the Elimination Method Works

The core idea behind the [[using_elimination_to_solve_equations | elimination method]] is to perform an operation (addition or subtraction) on both sides of an equation using equivalent values from another equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. For example, if you have two equations, `3x + 4y = 2.5` and `5x - 4y = 25.5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, you can add the second equation to the first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

The validity of adding two equations stems from the principle that if `A = B` and `C = D`, then `A + C = B + D`. When adding equations, you are adding the same quantity to both sides of the first equation because the second equation states that its left-hand side is equal to its right-hand side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. In the given example, `5x - 4y` is equal to `25.5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, so adding `5x - 4y` to the left side and `25.5` to the right side means you are adding the same value to both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

Applying this to `3x + 4y = 2.5` and `5x - 4y = 25.5`:
1.  **Add the equations:**
    `(3x + 4y) + (5x - 4y) = 2.5 + 25.5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>
2.  **Combine like terms:**
    `8x + 0y = 28` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>
    The `y` terms eliminate each other because `4y` and `-4y` sum to `0y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
3.  **Solve for the remaining variable:**
    `8x = 28` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>
    Divide both sides by 8: `x = 28/8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>
    [[stepbystep_algebraic_simplification | Simplifying the fraction]], `x = 7/2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>
4.  **Substitute the value back into one of the original equations to solve for the second variable:**
    Using `3x + 4y = 2.5`:
    `3 * (7/2) + 4y = 2.5` (or `5/2`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>
    `21/2 + 4y = 5/2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>
    Subtract `21/2` from both sides: `4y = 5/2 - 21/2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>
    `4y = -16/2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>
    `4y = -8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>
    Divide both sides by 4: `y = -2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>
5.  **Verify the solution:** The solution is `x = 7/2` and `y = -2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Substituting these values into the second equation (`5x - 4y = 25.5`):
    `5 * (7/2) - 4 * (-2) = 35/2 - (-8) = 17.5 + 8 = 25.5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. This confirms the solution satisfies both equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

## Real-Life Application: Candy Store Problem

The [[using_elimination_to_solve_equations | elimination method]] can be applied to real-world problems that can be modeled as systems of equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

### Problem Scenario
Nadia buys 3 candy bars and 4 Fruit Roll-Ups for $2.84 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. Peter buys 3 candy bars and 1 Fruit Roll-Up for $1.79 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. What is the cost of each candy bar and each Fruit Roll-Up? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>

### Setting up the Equations
Let:
*   `x` = cost of a candy bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>
*   `y` = cost of a Fruit Roll-Up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>

From Nadia's purchase: `3x + 4y = 2.84` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>
From Peter's purchase: `3x + 1y = 1.79` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>

### Solving Using Elimination
To eliminate a variable, observe that both equations have `3x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Subtracting the second equation from the first will eliminate the `x` term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. Subtracting `3x + y` from the left side and `$1.79` from the right side is valid because `3x + y` is equal to `$1.79` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

1.  **Subtract the second equation from the first:**
    `(3x + 4y) - (3x + y) = 2.84 - 1.79` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>
    This is equivalent to adding the second equation multiplied by -1: `(3x + 4y) + (-3x - y) = 2.84 + (-1.79)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>
2.  **Combine like terms:**
    `0x + (4y - y) = 1.05` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>
    `3y = 1.05` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>
3.  **Solve for `y`:**
    Divide both sides by 3: `y = 1.05 / 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>
    `y = 0.35` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>
    So, the cost of a Fruit Roll-Up is $0.35 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
4.  **Substitute `y` back into one of the original equations to solve for `x`:**
    Using Peter's equation: `3x + y = 1.79` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>
    `3x + 0.35 = 1.79` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>
    Subtract 0.35 from both sides: `3x = 1.79 - 0.35` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>
    `3x = 1.44` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>
5.  **Solve for `x`:**
    Divide both sides by 3: `x = 1.44 / 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>
    `x = 0.48` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>
    So, the cost of a candy bar is $0.48 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

### Conclusion
Using the [[using_elimination_to_solve_equations | elimination method]], we determined that the cost of a candy bar is $0.48, and the cost of a Fruit Roll-Up is $0.35 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.

The immune system is broadly categorized into two main types: the [[Nonspecific immune response and inflammatory response | nonspecific (innate) immune system]] and the specific (adaptive) immune system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## Nonspecific (Innate) Immune System
The [[Nonspecific immune response and inflammatory response | nonspecific immune system]] acts as a first line of defense with physical barriers like skin, stomach acid, and the acidity of skin oils, which prevent harmful substances from entering the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. If pathogens breach these barriers, a second line of nonspecific defense activates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This includes the [[Inflammatory response overview | inflammatory response]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, which directs immune cells to the site of action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, and phagocytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

Phagocytes, such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and [[Role of neutrophils and other white blood cells | neutrophils]], are [[Role of neutrophils and other white blood cells | white blood cells]] (leukocytes) that engulf and destroy foreign invaders without recognizing their specific type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This system reacts to general "shady" characteristics of pathogens, such as the presence of double-stranded DNA typically found in viruses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Specific (Adaptive) Immune System
In contrast, the [[Specific immune system and lymphocytes | specific immune system]], also known as the adaptive immune system, is thought to be a newer adaptation, particularly well-developed in humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. It develops resistance to specific pathogens after exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

The primary actors in the [[Specific immune system and lymphocytes | specific immune system]] are [[Specific immune system and lymphocytes | lymphocytes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. [[Specific immune system and lymphocytes | Lymphocytes]] are a type of [[Role of neutrophils and other white blood cells | white blood cell]] (leukocyte), distinct from phagocytes which are mostly nonspecific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

There are two main types of [[Specific immune system and lymphocytes | lymphocytes]]:
*   **B lymphocytes** (B cells) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>
*   **T lymphocytes** (T cells) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>

### Development of B and T Lymphocytes
*   **B lymphocytes** were initially identified in the bursa of Fabricius in birds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. In humans, B lymphocytes are produced and developed in the bone marrow, making "B" an easy way to remember their origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
*   **T lymphocytes** begin in the bone marrow but mature and become functional in the thymus gland, which is where the "T" comes from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

## Humoral Response
B lymphocytes are the primary participants in the **humoral response** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. The term "humoral" refers to the fluids of the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

The humoral response is effective against pathogens that are floating freely in the body's fluids, such as viruses or bacteria that have not yet infiltrated host cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

In contrast, the [[Cellmediated response and T lymphocytes | cell-mediated response]], primarily involving T lymphocytes (like helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>, addresses situations where pathogens like viruses have infiltrated and are replicating inside cells, or when cells have been colonized by bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. While helper T cells can play a role in amplifying and activating the humoral response, the direct action of the humoral response is against extracellular pathogens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

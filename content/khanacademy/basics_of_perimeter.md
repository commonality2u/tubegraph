[[Introduction to Geometry | Perimeter]] is the total distance around a figure or object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. It can be thought of as the length of a fence required to enclose a plot of land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, or the length of a tape wrapped around a figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Calculating Perimeter of Rectangles

A rectangle is a four-sided figure with four right angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. In a rectangle, opposite sides are equal in length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

To find the perimeter of a rectangle, you [[basic_addition_concepts | add]] the lengths of all its sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

### Example: Rectangle ABCD

Consider a rectangle ABCD where:
*   Side AB is 7 units long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   Side BC is 5 units long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

Since opposite sides are equal:
*   DC will also be 7 units long (equal to AB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
*   AD will also be 5 units long (equal to BC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

The perimeter of rectangle ABCD is calculated by [[basic_addition_concepts | summing]] the lengths of its sides:
Perimeter = AB + BC + CD + DA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>
Perimeter = 7 + 5 + 7 + 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>
Perimeter = 24 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Calculating Perimeter of Squares

A square is a special type of rectangle where all four sides are equal in length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Like a rectangle, it also has four right angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

To find the perimeter of a square, you can [[basics_of_multiplication | multiply]] the length of one side by four, because all sides are congruent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

### Example: Square ABCD with known perimeter

Suppose a square ABCD has a perimeter of 36 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
Let 'x' represent the length of each side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

The perimeter of the square is the sum of its four equal sides:
Perimeter = x + x + x + x = 4x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>

Given the perimeter is 36:
4x = 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>

To find 'x', divide both sides by 4:
x = 36 / 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>
x = 9 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>

So, each side of the square is 9 units long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

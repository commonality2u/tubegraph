[[understanding_slope_of_a_straight_line | Slope]] is a fundamental concept in mathematics that quantifies the steepness of a line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. It serves as a measure of how much the y-value changes for a given change in the x-value, effectively representing a [[properties_of_slope_in_linear_equations | rate of change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Defining Slope

The most common way to define [[finding the slope of a line | slope]] is as "change in y over change in x" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This can be mathematically expressed as:

$$
\text{Slope} = \frac{\text{Change in y}}{\text{Change in x}}
$$
Sometimes, the term "change in" is represented by the capital delta symbol (Δ), so the formula can also be written as:

$$
\text{Slope} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}
$$
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>

For any straight line, this [[slope_of_a_line_in_algebra | slope]] value will always be constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Calculating Slope from a Graph

When [[graph interpretation for slope calculation | determining slope]] from a graph, one can select any two distinct points on the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The key is to be consistent in how the changes in x and y are measured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

### Example 1: Positive Slope Calculation

Consider a line passing through the points (-3, -3) and (0, -1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

1.  **Change in x (Δx)**: Moving from x = -3 to x = 0, the change in x is 3 units (0 - (-3) = 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
    *   Δx = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>
2.  **Change in y (Δy)**: Moving from y = -3 to y = -1, the change in y is 2 units (-1 - (-3) = 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
    *   Δy = 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>

Therefore, the [[determining_slope | slope]] of the line is:

$$
\text{Slope} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{2}{3}
$$
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>

### Example 2: Consistency with Different Points and Direction

To demonstrate that the choice of points does not affect the slope, consider starting at (3, 1) and moving to (-3, -3) on the same line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

1.  **Change in y (Δy)**: Moving from y = 1 to y = -3, the change in y is -4 units (-3 - 1 = -4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
    *   Δy = -4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>
2.  **Change in x (Δx)**: Moving from x = 3 to x = -3, the change in x is -6 units (-3 - 3 = -6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
    *   Δx = -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>

The [[determining_slope | slope]] calculation yields:

$$
\text{Slope} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{-4}{-6} = \frac{2}{3}
$$
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>

Regardless of the two points chosen or the direction of movement (from left to right or right to left), the calculated [[finding the slope of a line | slope]] remains constant for a straight line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. This consistency is a key characteristic of linear relationships.

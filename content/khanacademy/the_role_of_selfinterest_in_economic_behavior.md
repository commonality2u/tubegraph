The concept of self-interest plays a foundational role in the field of economics, particularly as articulated by the Scottish philosopher [[adam_smith_and_the_invisible_hand | Adam Smith]].

## Adam Smith and the Invisible Hand

[[adam_smith_and_the_invisible_hand | Adam Smith]], considered by many to be the first true economist, outlined his ideas on self-interest in his seminal work, *The Wealth of Nations*, published in 1776 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This publication date notably coincides with the American Declaration of Independence, highlighting the simultaneous emergence of core ideas about democratic governance and economic [[capitalism_and_the_influence_of_economics_on_american_values | capitalism]] that profoundly shaped the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

A famous excerpt from Smith's work states:
> "He generally indeed, he being an economic actor, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By directing that industry, so that the industry in control of that individual actor in such a manner, as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain. And he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an [[adam_smith_and_the_invisible_hand | invisible hand]] to promote an end which was no part of his intention." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>

This concept of the "[[adam_smith_and_the_invisible_hand | invisible hand]]" suggests that when individual economic actors pursue their own self-interest, it often leads in aggregate to outcomes that benefit society, even if those outcomes were not explicitly intended by the individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Smith contended that by pursuing their own interest, individuals frequently promote that of society more effectively than if they directly intended to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

While [[adam_smith_and_the_invisible_hand | Adam Smith]] likely would not assert that self-interested action is *always* good, or that considering aggregate implications is *never* necessary, he argued that "frequently" such actions can lead to positive societal outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. These benefits can include:
*   More innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>
*   Better investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>
*   Increased productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>
*   Greater wealth, creating a "larger pie for everyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>

This perspective forms a core tenet of [[capitalism_and_the_influence_of_economics_on_american_values | capitalism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Self-Interest in Microeconomics

The ideas presented by [[adam_smith_and_the_invisible_hand | Adam Smith]] touch upon both [[microeconomics_vs_macroeconomics | micro-economic]] (individual actor self-interest) and [[microeconomics_vs_macroeconomics | macro-economic]] (benefits for the whole economy) principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

[[microeconomics_vs_macroeconomics | Microeconomics]] is the study of individual actors, such as firms, people, or households, and how they make decisions or allocate [[tradeoffs_in_resource_allocation | scarce resources]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. [[tradeoffs_in_resource_allocation | Scarce resources]] are those that are not infinite, like food, water, money, time, or labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. In [[microeconomics_vs_macroeconomics | microeconomics]], a central question is how individuals decide where to deploy these resources and how these decisions affect prices and markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

## Limitations of Economic Models and Assumptions

Modern economics strives for rigor and mathematical precision in both [[microeconomics_vs_macroeconomics | microeconomics]] and [[microeconomics_vs_macroeconomics | macroeconomics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. This often involves starting with philosophical or logical ideas about how people make decisions, then simplifying them to create mathematical models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

A common simplification in these models is the assumption that "all people are rational" and "all people are gonna act in their own self-interest, or all people are going to maximize their gain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. While this simplification allows for mathematical analysis, it is important to remember that human beings are motivated by a wide array of factors beyond just self-interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

### The Value and Danger of Simplification

The use of [[challenges_and_limitations_of_mathematical_models_in_economics | mathematical models]] in economics is valuable for clarifying thinking and allowing for proofs based on assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. However, this approach can also be dangerous due to the "huge simplifications" involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Mathematical conclusions, while seemingly robust, are contingent on these underlying assumptions, which may be wrong, over-simplifications, or irrelevant to the real-world context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. Therefore, it is crucial to interpret economic models "with a grain of salt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

### The Complexity of Human Behavior

Especially in [[microeconomics_vs_macroeconomics | macroeconomics]], where the behavior of millions of "infinitely complicated people" is aggregated, the interactions are "fundamentally unpredictable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Attempting to make predictions based on simplified assumptions and mathematical models in such a complex system can lead to conclusions that prove to be wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

These quotes highlight the importance of maintaining an intuitive understanding of economic principles and recognizing that economics, unlike physics, is open to subjectivity, especially concerning the assumptions chosen for its models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Ultimately, understanding the core intuition behind economic phenomena, even without complex mathematics, is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

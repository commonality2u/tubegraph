The information within [[dna_and_its_function_in_cells | DNA]] is expressed as proteins through a related molecule called RNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. RNA stands for ribonucleic acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>, sharing a similar sugar backbone with [[dna_and_its_function_in_cells | DNA]], which is deoxyribonucleic acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>.

## RNA as a Messenger

One primary function of RNA is to act as a messenger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>. Especially in cells with nuclei, the genetic information stored in [[dna_and_its_function_in_cells | DNA]] must exit the nucleus to be expressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>. RNA carries this information from a specific section of [[dna_and_its_function_in_cells | DNA]] to where it can be [[translation_of_rna_to_proteins | translated]] into a protein outside the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>.

## Transcription: DNA to mRNA

The process of converting [[dna_and_its_function_in_cells | DNA]] information into messenger RNA (mRNA) is called transcription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>. Conceptually, transcription involves constructing an mRNA strand from a [[dna_and_its_function_in_cells | DNA]] template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>. This mRNA molecule will then leave the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>.

A key difference in RNA synthesis is that adenine (A) in the [[dna_and_its_function_in_cells | DNA]] template pairs with uracil (U) in the RNA molecule, instead of thymine (T) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>. Cytosine (C) still pairs with guanine (G) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>. After transcription, the single-stranded RNA detaches from the [[dna_and_its_function_in_cells | DNA]], carrying the genetic information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>.

## Translation: mRNA to Protein

Once the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it attaches to an [[organelle_functions_such_as_ribosomes_endoplasmic_reticulum_and_golgi_bodies | organelle functions such as ribosomes endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi bodies | ribosome]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>. The process of converting the mRNA base sequence into an amino acid sequence, which forms a protein, is called [[translation_of_rna_to_proteins | translation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a>.

In [[translation_of_rna_to_proteins | translation]]:
*   **Codons** Every three bases on the mRNA molecule form a "codon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>, which codes for a specific amino acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>. With four possible bases in three positions, there are 4x4x4 = 64 possible codons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:38:00">[12:38:00]</a>. This provides more than enough combinations for the 20 possible amino acids, allowing some amino acids to be coded by more than one codon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>.
*   **tRNA** Another type of RNA, transfer RNA (tRNA), is responsible for bringing the correct amino acid to the [[organelle_functions_such_as_ribosomes_endoplasmic_reticulum_and_golgi_bodies | organelle functions such as ribosomes endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi bodies | ribosome]] according to the mRNA codon sequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>. The tRNA matches the mRNA codon sequence via its own complementary sequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:00">[13:51:00]</a>.
*   **Protein Assembly** As tRNAs deliver amino acids, they are linked together in a specific sequence, forming a protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:29:00">[14:29:00]</a>. Proteins are the molecules that perform most of the work in living organisms, acting as enzymes, structural components, and more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:42:00">[14:42:00]</a>.

This entire sequence, from [[dna_and_its_function_in_cells | DNA]] to RNA to protein, represents the central dogma of biology and is fundamental to the [[concept_of_gene_expression | concept of gene expression]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

[[gene_expression_and_its_significance | Gene expression]] is the process by which information from a [[dna_in_cells_and_the_role_of_nucleus | DNA]] sequence is used to synthesize a functional product, typically a protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. While [[dna_structure_and_its_role_in_heredity | DNA]] stores the genetic information, RNA plays a crucial role in acting as an intermediary to carry this information and facilitate the creation of proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

## What is RNA?
RNA stands for ribonucleic acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. Unlike DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), the sugar backbone in RNA is a ribonucleic acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. RNA is a molecule related to DNA, but it primarily functions as a messenger in the process of expressing the information contained in DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

## Transcription: From DNA to mRNA
In cells with nucleii, the [[dna_in_cells_and_the_role_of_nucleus | DNA]] resides within the nucleus, but its information largely needs to exit the nucleus to be expressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. One of RNA's primary functions is to serve as a messenger to carry specific sections of [[dna_in_cells_and_the_role_of_nucleus | DNA]] information outside the nucleus for [[translation_of_mrna_into_proteins | protein translation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

The process of going from [[dna_in_cells_and_the_role_of_nucleus | DNA]] to messenger RNA (mRNA) is called **transcription** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Conceptually, transcription is similar to [[dna_structure_and_its_role_in_heredity | DNA replication]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. During transcription, a strand of RNA (specifically mRNA) is constructed based on a section of a [[dna_in_cells_and_the_role_of_nucleus | DNA]] molecule, typically a gene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. This mRNA strand will then carry the information out of the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

### Base Pairing in RNA Synthesis
In RNA synthesis, the base pairing rules differ slightly from [[dna_structure_and_its_role_in_heredity | DNA replication]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>:
*   Adenine (A) pairs with Uracil (U) instead of Thymine (T) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. RNA contains uracil in place of thymine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   Cytosine (C) still pairs with Guanine (G) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.
Once the mRNA strand is synthesized based on the [[dna_in_cells_and_the_role_of_nucleus | DNA]] template, it detaches, forming a single strand of mRNA that carries all the information from that [[dna_in_cells_and_the_role_of_nucleus | DNA]] section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

## Translation: From mRNA to Protein
After transcription, the messenger RNA (mRNA) leaves the nucleus and attaches to a [[structure_and_function_of_ribosomes | ribosome]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. The process of using this mRNA code to create proteins is called **translation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. Translation involves converting the base pair sequence of mRNA into an amino acid sequence, which forms a protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

### Codons and Amino Acids
In mRNA, each sequence of three bases is called a **codon** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. Each codon codes for a specific amino acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. With four possible bases at three different positions, there are 4 x 4 x 4 = 64 possible codons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. This provides sufficient codons to code for the 20 possible amino acids, with some amino acids being coded by more than one codon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.

### Role of tRNA
During translation, another type of RNA, **transfer RNA (tRNA)**, plays a critical role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. tRNA molecules bring specific amino acids to the [[structure_and_function_of_ribosomes | ribosome]] according to the mRNA codons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. Each tRNA has an anticodon that matches a specific mRNA codon, ensuring the correct amino acid is brought into sequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

As amino acids are brought and linked together in sequence, they form a protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. Proteins are fundamental molecules that perform most of the work in living organisms, acting as enzymes, structural components, and more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. Thus, RNA acts as the crucial link between the genetic information stored in [[dna_in_cells_and_the_role_of_nucleus | DNA]] and its ultimate expression as functional proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

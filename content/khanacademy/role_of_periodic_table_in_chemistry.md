The [[periodic_table_and_atomic_number | periodic table]] of elements is a significant component of chemistry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. It is commonly found at the front of chemistry classrooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Historical Context and Understanding Complexity

The [[periodic_table_and_atomic_number | periodic table]] is the culmination of thousands of years of human effort to comprehend the intricate complexity of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. For centuries, humans observed a seemingly infinite array of different substances and phenomena in the [[importance_of_chemistry_in_understanding_the_universe | universe]], such as fire, rock, water, meteorological patterns on planets, and the complexity of life itself, including electrochemical interactions in the human brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This overwhelming diversity prompted the fundamental question of how to make sense of it all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

Over millennia, humanity began to understand this complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. A key insight, largely encapsulated by the [[periodic_table_and_atomic_number | periodic table]] of elements, is that all of this perceived complexity is fundamentally made of basic building blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Basic Building Blocks of Matter

Chemistry reveals that rather than an infinite number of distinct "legos" making up everything, there is actually a finite number of fundamental building blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. While new [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | elements]] are discovered infrequently now, a relatively small number of [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | elements]], such as carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen, disproportionately appear in a vast amount of what we observe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

These [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | elements]] themselves are composed of even smaller particles: protons, [[electrons_and_chemical_reactions | electrons]], and neutrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. The arrangement of these subatomic particles in different ways gives rise to the various [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | elements]] with their distinct properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This understanding allows chemists to create models and predict how these fundamental building blocks interact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

## Chemistry in the Hierarchy of Sciences

Chemistry is positioned above physics and mathematics in a conceptual hierarchy of sciences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. While mathematics studies logical ideas, and physics investigates the constituents of matter and their mathematical properties at the most basic level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>, chemistry takes these foundational principles to explain a vast array of phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

Chemistry is closely related to physics, as the interactions between [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | atoms]] that form [[introduction_to_chemical_equations | chemical equations]] and molecular structures are governed by quantum mechanical interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Building upon chemistry, sciences like [[interrelation_of_chemistry_physics_and_biology | biology]] emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Biological processes, such as human speech, are based on countless molecular interactions, which are fundamentally chemical in nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. This demonstrates how chemistry provides the framework for understanding complex systems observed in biology and beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

Chemistry constructs models that help us understand interactions at scales and speeds that cannot be directly observed, enabling predictions about our reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

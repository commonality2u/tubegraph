This article provides a fundamental overview of perimeter and area, two core concepts in [[introduction_to_geometry_terminology | geometry]].

## What is Perimeter?

Perimeter is defined as the total distance around an object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. It can be visualized as the length of a fence needed to enclose a plot of land or the length of a tape measure wrapped around a figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

### Calculating Perimeter of a Rectangle

A rectangle is a four-sided figure with four right angles, where opposite sides are equal in length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

To [[calculating_the_perimeter_of_rectangles_and_squares | calculate the perimeter of a rectangle]], you sum the lengths of all its sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

**Example: Rectangle ABCD**
Consider a rectangle ABCD where side AB is 7 units and side BC is 5 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
Since it's a rectangle:
*   Side AB = 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>
*   Side BC = 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>
*   Side DC (opposite AB) = 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>
*   Side DA (opposite BC) = 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>

The perimeter is calculated as:
7 + 5 + 7 + 5 = 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>

### Calculating Perimeter of a Square

A square is a special type of rectangle where all four sides are equal in length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

If you know the perimeter of a square, you can find the length of each side.
**Example: Square ABCD**
Assume a square ABCD has a perimeter of 36 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
Let 'x' be the length of each side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
The perimeter is the sum of all sides: x + x + x + x = 4x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
Given the perimeter is 36, we have the equation: 4x = 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
Dividing both sides by 4, we find x = 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
Thus, it is a 9x9 square, with each side measuring 9 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

## What is Area?

Area is a measure of how much two-dimensional space a figure occupies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. A common way to conceptualize area is by determining how many 1-by-1 squares (also known as unit squares) can fit within the figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

### Calculating Area of a Rectangle

To find the [[understanding_and_calculating_area_of_rectangles | area of a rectangle]], you multiply its length by its width <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

**Example: Rectangle ABCD**
Using the same rectangle from the perimeter example (sides 7 and 5):
The area of rectangle ABCD is the number of 1-by-1 squares that fit inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
You can fit 7 unit squares along one side and 5 unit squares along the adjacent side, forming a grid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
The total number of squares is found by multiplying the number of rows by the number of columns: 5 rows * 7 columns = 35 unit squares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
So, the area of this rectangle is 35 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

### Calculating Area of a Square

A square is a special case of a rectangle where the length and width are the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

To [[calculating_area_of_squares | calculate the area of a square]], you multiply the side length by itself (side * side) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. This operation is why the term "squaring" a number is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

**Example: Square XYZS**
Consider a square XYZS where one side (XS) is 2 units long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
Since all sides of a square are equal, both length and width are 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
The area is 2 * 2 = 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
You can visually confirm this by fitting 4 1-by-1 squares inside a 2x2 square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

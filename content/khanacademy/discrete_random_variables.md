[[Random Variables | Random variables]] can be categorized into two main types: [[discrete_vs_continuous_random_variables | discrete]] and [[continuous_random_variables | continuous]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Definition
[[discrete_vs_continuous_random_variables | Discrete random variables]] are those that can take on distinct or separate values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The term "discrete" here refers to values that are distinct or separate, not to politeness or subtlety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

A key characteristic of a [[discrete_vs_continuous_random_variables | discrete random variable]] is that you can count the number of different values it can take on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Even if the number of possible values is infinite, as long as they can be literally listed as a first, second, third value (meaning they are countable), then it is a [[discrete_vs_continuous_random_variables | discrete random variable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

## [[examples_of_discrete_variables | Examples of Discrete Variables]]

### Coin Flip Outcome
A [[random_variables | random variable]] *X* defined as 1 if a fair coin is heads and 0 if tails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a> is a [[discrete_vs_continuous_random_variables | discrete random variable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This is because *X* can only take on two distinct values: 1 or 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, which are clearly countable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### Year of Birth
A [[random_variables | random variable]] *Y* representing the year a random student in a class was born <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a> is a [[discrete_vs_continuous_random_variables | discrete random variable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. The year can be a specific, distinct value like 1992, 1985, or 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. It cannot take on any value between two years, such as between 2000 and 2001; it will be either 2000 or 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. The possible values are countable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

### Number of Ants Born
A [[random_variables | random variable]] *Z* representing the number of ants born tomorrow in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a> is a [[discrete_vs_continuous_random_variables | discrete random variable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. The number of ants can be 1, 2, 3, or any whole number up to a quadrillion, but it will always be a countable, distinct value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

### Rounded Time
If a [[random_variables | random variable]] *X* is defined as the winning time for the men's 100-meter dash at the 2016 Olympics *rounded to the nearest hundredth* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>, it becomes a [[discrete_vs_continuous_random_variables | discrete random variable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. This is because the values are now specific and countable, such as 9.56 seconds, 9.57 seconds, or 9.58 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. This contrasts with an *exact* winning time, which would be a [[continuous_random_variables | continuous random variable]] because it could take on any value within an interval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

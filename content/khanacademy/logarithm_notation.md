[[introduction_to_logarithms | Logarithms]] are a fundamental concept in mathematics that help determine the power to which a base number must be raised to obtain another number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This concept is essentially the inverse of exponentiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Defining Logarithm Notation

The notation for a logarithm is `log` followed by a base number written as a subscript, and then the number being evaluated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

For example, to ask "what power do you have to raise 2 to, to get 16?", we write this in logarithm notation as:
`log₂ (16) = x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>

In this notation:
*   `log` signifies a logarithm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   `2` is the *base* of the logarithm, written as a subscript <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   `16` is the number we are taking the logarithm of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   `x` is the *power* to which the base (2) must be raised to get 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### Equivalence to Exponential Statements

A logarithm expression `log_b (y) = x` is completely equivalent to the exponential statement `b^x = y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This highlights the [[inverse_relationship_between_logarithms_and_exponents | inverse relationship between logarithms and exponents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

For example:
*   The expression `2^x = 16` means "2 raised to some power 'x' equals 16" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   The logarithm `log₂ (16) = x` means "what power do I need to raise 2 to, to get 16?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

Both statements lead to the same answer: `x = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## [[evaluating_logarithmic_expressions | Evaluating Logarithmic Expressions]]

When [[evaluating_logarithmic_expressions | evaluating a logarithmic expression]], you are finding the exponent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

### Examples

*   **`log₃ (81)`** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>
    *   This asks: "What power do I have to raise 3 to, to get 81?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>
    *   Expressed exponentially: `3^x = 81` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>
    *   Calculations:
        *   `3¹ = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>
        *   `3² = 9` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>
        *   `3³ = 27` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>
        *   `3⁴ = 81` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>
    *   Therefore, `log₃ (81) = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

*   **`log₆ (216)`** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>
    *   This asks: "What power do we have to raise 6 to, to get 216?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>
    *   Calculations:
        *   `6¹ = 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>
        *   `6² = 36` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>
        *   `6³ = 36 * 6 = 216` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>
    *   Therefore, `log₆ (216) = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

*   **`log₂ (64)`** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>
    *   This asks: "The exponent that I have to raise 2 to, to get to 64" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
    *   Calculations:
        *   `2¹ = 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>
        *   `2² = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>
        *   `2³ = 8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>
        *   `2⁴ = 16` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>
        *   `2⁵ = 32` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>
        *   `2⁶ = 64` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>
    *   Therefore, `log₂ (64) = 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

## [[special_cases_in_logarithms | Special Cases]]

*   **`log_b (1) = 0`** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>
    *   This asks: "What power do I have to raise `b` (any base) to, to get 1?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
    *   Expressed exponentially: `b^x = 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
    *   Any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 equals 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
    *   Therefore, `log₁₀₀ (1) = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

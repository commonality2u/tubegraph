For thousands of years, humans have observed that different [[properties_of_substances_and_elements | substances]] in their environment possess distinct [[properties_of_substances_and_elements | properties]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. These [[properties_of_substances_and_elements | properties]] can include how they reflect light, their color, or their state (liquid, gas, or solid) at a given temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. People also began to notice how these [[properties_of_substances_and_elements | substances]] [[interaction_and_behavior_of_atoms | react with each other]] under certain conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Examples of such [[properties_of_substances_and_elements | substances]] include carbon (in its graphite form), lead, and gold, all of which are depicted in their solid state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

Furthermore, it was recognized that air consists of different particles like carbon, oxygen, or nitrogen, each having its own unique [[properties_of_substances_and_elements | properties]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. [[properties_of_substances_and_elements | Substances]] can also exist in liquid forms, and even solids like gold or lead can become liquid if heated to a high enough temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Carbon, when burned, can transition into a gaseous state, releasing into the atmosphere as its structure breaks down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. These observations have been made by humanity for millennia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## The Concept of Elements

A fundamental question arises: If a [[properties_of_substances_and_elements | substance]] like carbon is continuously broken down into smaller and smaller pieces, is there a smallest unit that still retains the [[properties_of_substances_and_elements | properties]] of carbon? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a> The answer is yes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

These pure [[properties_of_substances_and_elements | substances]] with specific [[properties_of_substances_and_elements | properties]] at certain temperatures and characteristic reaction behaviors are called [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | elements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Examples of [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | elements]] include carbon, lead, and gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Historically, water was considered an [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | element]], but it is now known to be composed of more [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | basic elements]]: oxygen and hydrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. All known [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | elements]] are systematically listed in the [[periodic_table_of_elements | Periodic Table of Elements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## The Atom: Basic Building Block

The most [[basic_building_blocks_of_matter | basic unit]] of any [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | element]] is the [[atomic_structure_and_subatomic_particles | atom]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. If you were to continuously divide a [[properties_of_substances_and_elements | substance]], you would eventually reach an [[atomic_structure_and_subatomic_particles | atom]] of that [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | element]]—for example, a carbon [[atomic_structure_and_subatomic_particles | atom]] or a gold [[atomic_structure_and_subatomic_particles | atom]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. This [[atomic_structure_and_subatomic_particles | atom]] is the smallest unit that still retains the [[properties_of_substances_and_elements | properties]] of its respective [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | element]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

Atoms are extraordinarily small—unimaginably so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. For context, an average human hair is approximately 1 million carbon [[atomic_structure_and_subatomic_particles | atoms]] wide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

> "There are 1 million carbon atoms, or you could string 1 million carbon atoms across the width of the average human hair." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>

## Atomic Structure and Subatomic Particles

What makes the concept of [[atomic_structure_and_subatomic_particles | atoms]] even more fascinating is that these [[basic_building_blocks_of_matter | basic building blocks]] are themselves composed of even more fundamental particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. The arrangement of these fundamental particles defines the [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | element]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Changing the number of these particles can alter the [[properties_of_substances_and_elements | properties]] of an [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | element]] or even transform it into a different [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | element]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

The three primary subatomic particles are:

### Protons
*   **Location**: Found in the nucleus (center) of the [[atomic_structure_and_subatomic_particles | atom]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **Charge**: Have a positive charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.
*   **Defining Characteristic**: The number of protons is what *defines* an [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | element]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. This is known as the [[atomic_structure_and_subatomic_particles | atomic number]], which is literally the number of protons in the [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | element]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
    *   Hydrogen has one proton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
    *   Helium has two protons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
    *   Carbon has six protons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
    *   If a carbon [[atomic_structure_and_subatomic_particles | atom]] were to gain a proton, it would become nitrogen (seven protons) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

### Neutrons
*   **Location**: Also found in the nucleus of the [[atomic_structure_and_subatomic_particles | atom]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **Charge**: Are neutral (have no charge) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
*   **Variability**: The number of neutrons can vary within the same [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | element]] without changing the [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | element]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. For instance, Carbon-12 has six protons and six neutrons, while Carbon-14 still has six protons but eight neutrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

### Electrons
*   **Location**: Move around, or "buzz around," the nucleus of the [[atomic_structure_and_subatomic_particles | atom]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. While sometimes conceptualized as orbiting like planets, their behavior is more complex and involves [[relation_between_chemistry_and_other_sciences | quantum physics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
*   **Charge**: Have a negative charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
*   **Interaction**: Unlike charges (protons and electrons) attract each other, binding the electrons to the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
*   **Variability and [[interaction_and_behavior_of_atoms | Chemical Reactions]]**: The number of electrons can change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. If an [[atomic_structure_and_subatomic_particles | atom]] is neutral, it has an equal number of protons and electrons (e.g., neutral Carbon-12 has six electrons) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. However, electrons can be gained or lost by an [[atomic_structure_and_subatomic_particles | atom]], leading to a net positive or negative charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. For example, if a carbon [[atomic_structure_and_subatomic_particles | atom]] loses an electron, it would have six protons but only five electrons, resulting in a net positive charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. The number and configuration of electrons in an [[atomic_structure_and_subatomic_particles | atom]] are crucial for understanding [[relation_between_chemistry_and_other_sciences | chemistry]] and predicting how [[atomic_structure_and_subatomic_particles | atoms]] will [[interaction_and_behavior_of_atoms | interact or bond]] with each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

This [[atomic_structure and subatomic particles | fundamental building block]], the [[atomic_structure_and_subatomic_particles | atom]], and its constituent particles, reveal how [[properties_of_substances_and_elements | properties]] can be changed and how one [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | element]] can potentially transform into another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.

Multiplication is a fundamental mathematical operation used to efficiently count larger groups of items or perform repeated addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. It simplifies the process of adding the same number to itself multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## What is Multiplication?
[[Multiplication as repeated addition | Multiplication]] can be understood as a compact way of performing addition repeatedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. For example, the expression "2 times 3" means adding the number 2 to itself three times (2 + 2 + 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

### Example: 2 times 3
To calculate 2 times 3:
*   Add 2 to itself three times: 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   Alternatively, add 3 to itself two times: 3 + 3 = 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
Both methods yield the same result, 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

## Simplifying Counting with Multiplication
Multiplication is especially useful for quickly counting items arranged in arrays or groups, where directly counting each item would be time-consuming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

### The Lemon Example
Consider a group of lemons arranged in rows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>:
*   There are 3 lemons in each row <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   There are 4 rows of lemons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

Instead of counting each lemon individually (1, 2, 3... 12), multiplication can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. The total number of lemons can be found by multiplying the number of lemons per row by the number of rows: 4 times 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

Using [[multiplication_as_repeated_addition | repeated addition]]:
*   Four 3's: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   Three 4's: 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

This demonstrates how multiplication simplifies counting, particularly when dealing with larger quantities like 100 lemons per row and 100 rows, where direct counting would take "forever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

## Properties of Multiplication
### Commutative Property
One of the useful [[properties_of_multiplication | properties of multiplication]] is that the order of the numbers being multiplied does not change the result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. For example, 4 times 3 is the same as 3 times 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. This is sometimes referred to as "four 3's" or "three 4's," which can be more intuitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

### Multiplication with 1 and 0
Understanding [[multiplication_with_1_and_0 | multiplication with 1 and 0]] are key [[basic_multiplication_concepts | basic multiplication concepts]]:
*   **Multiplying by 1**: Any number multiplied by 1 results in the original number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. For example:
    *   3 times 1 = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>
    *   1 times 3 = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>
    *   100 times 1 = 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>
    *   1 times 39 = 39 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>
*   **Multiplying by 0**: Any number multiplied by 0 results in 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. This is because it means adding the number zero times (e.g., "4 zero times" means nothing at all) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. For example:
    *   4 times 0 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>
    *   5,493,692 times 0 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>
    *   0 times 17 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>

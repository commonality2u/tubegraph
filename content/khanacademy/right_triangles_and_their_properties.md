Trigonometry is the study of the ratios of sides of triangles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The word "trig" in trigonometry means triangle, and "metry" means measure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Understanding Right Triangles

A [[understanding_right_triangles | right triangle]] is defined by having one [[basic_geometry_involving_right_angles_and_equal_sides | right angle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. A [[basic_geometry_involving_right_angles_and_equal_sides | right angle]] measures 90 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

### The Hypotenuse

In a [[understanding_right_triangles | right triangle]], the [[identifying_the_hypotenuse_in_right_triangles | hypotenuse]] is the side opposite the [[basic_geometry_involving_right_angles_and_equal_sides | right angle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. It is also the longest side of a [[understanding_right_triangles | right triangle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. For example, in a [[understanding_right_triangles | right triangle]] with sides 3, 4, and 5, the side with length 5 is the [[identifying_the_hypotenuse_in_right_triangles | hypotenuse]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This relationship can be verified using the Pythagorean theorem, where 3 squared plus 4 squared equals 5 squared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Core Trigonometric Functions

The fundamental [[trigonometric_functions_and_their_definitions | trigonometric functions]] are:
*   The [[trigonometric_functions_and_their_definitions | sine function]] (sin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>
*   The [[trigonometric_functions_and_their_definitions | cosine function]] (cos) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>
*   The [[trigonometric_functions_and_their_definitions | tangent function]] (tan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>

These functions specify the [[application_of_trigonometry_in_right_triangles | ratios of certain sides]] for any [[applying_trigonometry_to_different_angles_in_a_triangle | angle]] within a [[understanding_right_triangles | triangle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

### The SOH CAH TOA Mnemonic

To remember the definitions of these [[trigonometric_functions_and_their_definitions | functions]], the mnemonic "SOH CAH TOA" is useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

> [!NOTE] SOH CAH TOA
> *   **SOH**: **S**ine = **O**pposite / **H**ypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>
> *   **CAH**: **C**osine = **A**djacent / **H**ypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>
> *   **TOA**: **T**angent = **O**pposite / **A**djacent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>

The terms "opposite" and "adjacent" refer to the sides relative to a specific [[applying_trigonometry_to_different_angles_in_a_triangle | angle]] in the [[understanding_right_triangles | triangle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. The [[identifying_the_hypotenuse_in_right_triangles | hypotenuse]] remains the same regardless of which non-[[basic_geometry_involving_right_angles_and_equal_sides | right angle]] is chosen.

## Applying Trigonometry to Angles

Consider a [[understanding_right_triangles | right triangle]] with sides 3, 4, and 5.

### For Angle Theta (θ)

Let's use the [[applying_trigonometry_to_different_angles_in_a_triangle | angle]] θ, located between the sides of length 4 and 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

*   **Opposite side:** The side opposite to θ is the side with length 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **Adjacent side:** The side adjacent to θ (that is not the hypotenuse) is the side with length 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   **Hypotenuse:** The [[identifying_the_hypotenuse_in_right_triangles | hypotenuse]] is the side with length 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

Using SOH CAH TOA:
*   **Sine (θ):** Opposite / Hypotenuse = 3 / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>
*   **Cosine (θ):** Adjacent / Hypotenuse = 4 / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>
*   **Tangent (θ):** Opposite / Adjacent = 3 / 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>

The [[application_of_trigonometry_in_right_triangles | ratio]] of the opposite to the [[identifying_the_hypotenuse_in_right_triangles | hypotenuse]] (and other ratios) for a specific [[applying_trigonometry_to_different_angles_in_a_triangle | angle]] will always be the same, regardless of whether the [[understanding_right_triangles | triangle]] is larger or smaller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

### For Angle X

Now, let's consider the other non-[[basic_geometry_involving_right_angles_and_equal_sides | right angle]], labeled X <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

*   **Opposite side:** For [[applying_trigonometry_to_different_angles_in_a_triangle | angle]] X, the opposite side is the side with length 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   **Adjacent side:** For [[applying_trigonometry_to_different_angles_in_a_triangle | angle]] X, the adjacent side is the side with length 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   **Hypotenuse:** The [[identifying_the_hypotenuse_in_right_triangles | hypotenuse]] remains the side with length 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

Using SOH CAH TOA:
*   **Sine (X):** Opposite / Hypotenuse = 4 / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>
*   **Cosine (X):** Adjacent / Hypotenuse = 3 / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>
*   **Tangent (X):** Opposite / Adjacent = 4 / 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>

This definition of [[trigonometric_functions_and_their_definitions | sine]], [[trigonometric_functions_and_their_definitions | cosine]], and [[trigonometric_functions_and_their_definitions | tangent]] using "SOH CAH TOA" is primarily applicable for [[applying_trigonometry_to_different_angles_in_a_triangle | angles]] between 0 and 90 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. For [[applying_trigonometry_to_different_angles_in_a_triangle | angles]] outside this range, a more generalized definition is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

[[exponents_and_radical_notation | Exponents]] represent repeated multiplication of a base number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. For example, "2 to the fourth power" means 2 multiplied by itself 4 times (2 x 2 x 2 x 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This calculation results in 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Exponents in Practice

To understand [[exponents_and_radical_notation | exponents]], consider the following examples:
*   2 to the first power is 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
*   2 to the second power is 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   2 to the fourth power (2 x 2 x 2 x 2) equals 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   2 to the sixth power is 64 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   3 to the first power is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   3 to the second power is 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
*   3 to the third power is 27 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   3 to the fourth power (27 x 3) equals 81 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   6 to the first power is 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   6 to the second power is 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   6 to the third power (36 x 6) equals 216 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

## Finding the Exponent

While [[exponents_and_radical_notation | exponents]] calculate the result of a base raised to a power, sometimes the challenge is to find the power (or exponent) to which a base must be raised to achieve a specific number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. For instance, determining what power 2 must be raised to in order to get 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This is where [[inverse_relationship_between_logarithms_and_exponents | logarithms]] come into play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

Logarithms are used to express this relationship. The statement "what power do I need to raise 2 to, to get 16?" is written as "log base 2 of 16" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. This [[mathematical_expressions | expression]] evaluates to 4, as 2 raised to the 4th power is 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

Consider the [[understanding_mathematical_equations | equation]] `3^x = 81` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. To find `x`, you need to determine what power 3 must be raised to to get 81. As shown above, `3^4 = 81`, so `x = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. This process is essentially [[evaluating_logarithmic_expressions | evaluating logarithmic expressions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## The Zero Exponent

A special rule for [[exponents_and_radical_notation | exponents]] is that any non-zero base raised to the power of 0 always equals 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. For example, 100 raised to the power of 0 (100^0) equals 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Therefore, "log base 100 of 1" would evaluate to 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. This property holds true for any base (that is not 0 itself) raised to the power of 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

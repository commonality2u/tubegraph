Grammar is defined as a set of conventions and rules that govern language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. While both are integral to language, there is a distinct [[difference_between_functions_and_relations | difference]] between a rule and a convention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Rules Explained

A **rule** represents the bare minimum requirement for language to be understandable by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. It's what ensures communication functions as intended.

## Conventions Explained

A **convention**, on the other hand, is a widely accepted practice or agreement that is not strictly necessary for understanding but contributes to a shared style or norm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Conventions are not necessarily "true" or universally required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Analogy: The Car

To illustrate the [[difference_between_functions_and_relations | difference]]:

*   **Rule:** For a car to move forward as intended, its wheels *must* be on the bottom, not on the roof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This is a fundamental requirement for the car to function.
*   **Convention:** The idea that all cars *should* be painted teal is a convention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. A car's color does not prevent it from functioning or moving forward; it's a matter of preference or agreed-upon style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. The speaker emphasizes that the color of a car (pink, green, purple, Paisley) doesn't matter, as long as "your wheels are on straight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

Grammar is context-dependent, meaning the kind of grammar used changes based on who is being addressed, what is being communicated, and how it's being said <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. People use multiple kinds of grammar throughout their daily lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. The aim of studying grammar is not to dictate what is "right" or "wrong," but to provide tools to harness and use language effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.

The [[concept_of_slope_as_rise_over_run | slope]] of a line indicates its steepness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. For a straight line, the slope is a constant value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Formula for Slope

Slope is defined as the change in *y* divided by the change in *x* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>:

$$
\text{Slope} = \frac{\text{Change in y}}{\text{Change in x}}
$$

This is often represented using the Greek capital letter delta (Δ), which means "change in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>:

$$
\text{Slope} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}
$$

## Calculating Slope from a Graph

To find the slope of a line from a graph, select any two distinct points on the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. It's often easiest to choose points with integer coordinates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

### Example 1

Consider starting at the point (-3, -3) and moving to the point (0, -1):
*   **Change in x (Δx):** Moving from x = -3 to x = 0 means an increase of 3 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. So, Δx = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Change in y (Δy):** Moving from y = -3 to y = -1 means an increase of 2 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. So, Δy = 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

Using the formula:
$$
\text{Slope} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{2}{3}
$$

### Example 2 (Demonstrating Consistency)

The slope of a line is constant, regardless of which two points you choose on the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Let's demonstrate this by choosing different points, for instance, starting at (3, 1) and moving to (-3, -3):
*   **Change in y (Δy):** Moving from y = 1 down to y = -3 means a decrease of 4 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. So, Δy = -4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   **Change in x (Δx):** Moving from x = 3 to x = -3 means a decrease of 6 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. So, Δx = -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

Using the formula:
$$
\text{Slope} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{-4}{-6} = \frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3}
$$
As shown, the slope remains the same, 2/3, which highlights the [[consistent_calculation_of_slope_from_any_two_points | consistency in calculating slope]] from any two points on the line, provided you are consistent with your starting and ending points for both x and y <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

Logarithms are a fundamental concept in mathematics, providing a way to answer a specific question about powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Understanding Logarithms: The Core Idea

At its heart, a logarithm helps determine what power you need to raise a specific number (called the base) to, in order to get another number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

For instance, consider the exponent 2 to the fourth power (2^4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This means 2 multiplied by itself 4 times: 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

Now, reverse the question: If you start with 2 and want to reach 16, what power do you need to raise 2 to? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a> The answer is 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This is precisely what logarithms are designed to calculate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## [[logarithm_notation_and_conversion | Logarithm Notation]]

The way to write the question "what power do I need to raise 2 to, to get 16?" in [[logarithm_notation_and_conversion | logarithm notation]] is:
`log base 2 of 16 = x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>

Here:
*   `log` signifies the logarithm operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   `base 2` (written as a subscript) is the number being raised to a power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   `of 16` is the target number you want to reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   `x` is the unknown exponent we are trying to find <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## [[inverse_relationship_between_logarithms_and_exponents | Inverse Relationship with Exponents]]

The statement `log base 2 of 16 = x` is completely equivalent to the exponential statement `2^x = 16` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Both statements ask the same question, just in different forms, highlighting the [[inverse_relationship_between_logarithms_and_exponents | inverse relationship between logarithms and exponents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. In this example, `x` would be 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### Example 1: Log Base 3 of 81

`log base 3 of 81 = ?` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>

This asks: "What power do you have to raise 3 to, to get to 81?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>
You can set this as `3^x = 81` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
By experimenting:
*   3^1 = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>
*   3^2 = 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>
*   3^3 = 27 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>
*   3^4 = 81 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>

So, `log base 3 of 81 = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

### Example 2: Log Base 6 of 216

`log base 6 of 216 = ?` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>

This asks: "What power do we have to raise 6 to, to get 216?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>
*   6^1 = 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>
*   6^2 = 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>
*   6^3 = 216 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>

Therefore, `log base 6 of 216 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

### Example 3: Log Base 2 of 64

`log base 2 of 64 = ?` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>

This asks: "What exponent do I have to raise 2 to, to get to 64?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>
*   2^1 = 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>
*   2^2 = 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>
*   2^3 = 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>
*   2^4 = 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>
*   2^5 = 32 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>
*   2^6 = 64 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>

Thus, `log base 2 of 64 = 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

### Special Case: Logarithm of 1

`log base 100 of 1 = ?` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>

This asks: "What power do I have to raise 100 to, to get to 1?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>
If we set this to `x`, it becomes `100^x = 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
Any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 is equal to 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
So, `x = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

> [!definition] Logarithm of 1
> `log base b of 1 = 0` for any valid base `b` (where `b` is not 0) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. This is because any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 is 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

Logarithms are a fundamental mathematical concept used to determine the power to which a base number must be raised to produce a given number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

## Relationship with Exponents

To understand logarithms, it's helpful to first recall [[relationship_between_exponents_and_logarithms | exponents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. For example, `2` to the fourth power means `2` multiplied by itself `4` times:
`2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 16` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

Logarithms pose the question in reverse: If you start with a base (e.g., 2) and raise it to some power, what must that power be to get a specific result (e.g., 16)? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>
For `2^X = 16`, `X` would be `4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. This concept is at the core of what [[relationship_between_exponents_and_logarithms | logarithms]] are about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

## Logarithm Notation

The way to express this question using [[logarithm_properties_and_notation | logarithm notation]] is:
`log` base `2` of `16 = X` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

The statement `2^X = 16` and `log₂16 = X` are [[inverse_relationship_between_logarithms_and_exponents | completely equivalent statements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.
Both ask: "What power do I need to raise `2` to, to get `16`?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>
The answer is `X = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

## Evaluating Logarithmic Expressions

Here are [[examples_of_calculating_logarithms | several examples]] of [[evaluating logarithmic expressions | evaluating logarithmic expressions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>:

*   **`log₃81`**
    This asks: "What power do you have to raise `3` to, to get `81`?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>
    *   `3¹ = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>
    *   `3² = 9` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>
    *   `3³ = 27` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>
    *   `3⁴ = 81` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>
    Therefore, `log₃81 = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

*   **`log₆216`**
    This asks: "What power do we have to raise `6` to, to get `216`?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>
    *   `6¹ = 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>
    *   `6² = 36` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>
    *   `6³ = 216` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>
    Therefore, `log₆216 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.

*   **`log₂64`**
    This asks: "What exponent do I have to raise the base `2` to, to get `64`?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>
    *   `2¹ = 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>
    *   `2² = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>
    *   `2³ = 8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>
    *   `2⁴ = 16` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>
    *   `2⁵ = 32` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>
    *   `2⁶ = 64` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>
    Therefore, `log₂64 = 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>.

*   **`log₁₀₀1`**
    This asks: "What power do I have to raise `100` to, to get `1`?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>
    This can be written as `100^X = 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>.
    Any non-zero number raised to the power of `0` is `1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>.
    Therefore, `X = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>, and `log₁₀₀1 = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.

### Property: Logarithm of One
A general [[logarithm_properties_and_notation | property]] is that `log` base *anything* of `1` will always be equal to `0`, provided the base is not `0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>. This is because any non-zero number raised to the power of `0` equals `1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>.

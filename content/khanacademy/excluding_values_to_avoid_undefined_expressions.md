When simplifying rational expressions, it is crucial to identify and exclude any variable values that would make the original expression undefined. This ensures that the simplified expression remains truly [[understanding_equivalent_expressions | equivalent]] to the original one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

## Rational Expressions and Lowest Terms

Just as rational numbers (fractions) can be put into lowest terms by canceling common factors in the numerator and denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, the same principle applies to rational expressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Rational expressions are similar to rational numbers, but their numerators and denominators are [[understanding_algebraic_expressions | expressions]] involving variables instead of just numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

To simplify a rational expression, you factor both the numerator and the denominator to find any common factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Once common factors are identified, they can be canceled out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## The Importance of Exclusions

While canceling common factors simplifies the expression, it's vital to remember that the original expression would be **undefined** if its denominator were equal to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Even after simplification, the simplified form is only equivalent to the original if these excluded values are explicitly stated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. If an x-value makes the denominator zero in the original expression, it must still be excluded from the domain of the simplified expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. This concept highlights the [[difference_between_undefined_points_and_values_in_a_function | difference between undefined points and values in a function]] and how it relates to [[comparison_of_limits_and_function_values | function equivalence]].

## Examples

### Example 1: Linear Expressions

Consider the expression: `(9x + 3) / (12x + 4)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>

1.  **Factor the numerator**: Factor out 3: `3 * (3x + 1)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>
2.  **Factor the denominator**: Factor out 4: `4 * (3x + 1)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>
3.  **Identify common factors**: Both have `(3x + 1)` as a common factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
4.  **Simplify**: The expression becomes `3/4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
5.  **Determine excluded values**: The original denominator `12x + 4` would be zero if `3x + 1 = 0`, which means `x = -1/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
6.  **Final simplified expression with exclusion**: `3/4`, where `x ≠ -1/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

### Example 2: Quadratic Expressions

Consider the expression: `(x² - 9) / (5x + 15)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>

1.  **Factor the numerator**: This is a difference of squares: `(x + 3)(x - 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
2.  **Factor the denominator**: Factor out 5: `5(x + 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
3.  **Identify common factors**: Both have `(x + 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
4.  **Simplify**: The expression becomes `(x - 3) / 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
5.  **Determine excluded values**: The original denominator `5x + 15` would be zero if `x + 3 = 0`, which means `x = -3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
6.  **Final simplified expression with exclusion**: `(x - 3) / 5`, where `x ≠ -3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### Example 3: Factoring Quadratics

Consider the expression: `(x² + 6x + 5) / (x² - x - 2)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>

1.  **Factor the numerator**: `(x + 5)(x + 1)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
2.  **Factor the denominator**: `(x - 2)(x + 1)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
3.  **Identify common factors**: Both have `(x + 1)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
4.  **Simplify**: The expression becomes `(x + 5) / (x - 2)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
5.  **Determine excluded values**: The original denominator `(x² - x - 2)` would be zero if `x - 2 = 0` (so `x = 2`) or `x + 1 = 0` (so `x = -1`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
6.  **Final simplified expression with exclusion**: `(x + 5) / (x - 2)`, where `x ≠ -1` and `x ≠ 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

### Example 4: Factoring by Grouping

Consider the expression: `(3x² + 3x - 18) / (2x² + 5x - 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>

1.  **Factor the numerator**: Using factoring by grouping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>, `3x² + 3x - 18` becomes `(3x - 6)(x + 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
2.  **Factor the denominator**: Using factoring by grouping, `2x² + 5x - 3` becomes `(2x - 1)(x + 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.
3.  **Identify common factors**: Both have `(x + 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.
4.  **Simplify**: The expression becomes `(3x - 6) / (2x - 1)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.
5.  **Determine excluded values**: The original denominator `(2x - 1)(x + 3)` would be zero if `x + 3 = 0` (so `x = -3`) or `2x - 1 = 0` (so `x = 1/2`).
6.  **Final simplified expression with exclusion**: `(3x - 6) / (2x - 1)`, where `x ≠ -3` and `x ≠ 1/2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

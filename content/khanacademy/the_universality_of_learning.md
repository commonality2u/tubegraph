Learning is a fundamental human experience, inherent to everyone from birth. It is a universal process that begins with no prior knowledge or skill, progressing through stages of struggle and growth to master complex concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Everyone Starts at Zero
Regardless of future potential or achievement, every individual begins life with no inherent "smartness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. At first, no one can talk, walk, or perform complex tasks like algebra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Even historical geniuses like Albert Einstein had to learn basic counting, and William Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs, just like everyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Nobody is proficient at anything when they first attempt it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## The Process of Growth
Humans are innately "born to learn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. [[The process of learning and growth | The process of learning and growth]] unfolds gradually and incrementally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. It involves:
*   Stumbling, slipping, crawling, falling, and failing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   Experiencing frustration and confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   Persistent struggling until a breakthrough is achieved, much like a child learning to walk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

Each step builds upon the last, with one idea stacking on top of the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Crucially, [[the_role_of_failure_in_learning | the role of failure in learning]] is highlighted, as every "wrong answer" contributes to strengthening the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Indeed, "failing is just another word for growing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This continuous progression defines learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Learning Potential and Accessibility
A core aspect of [[confidence_in_learning_potential | confidence in learning potential]] is the conviction that understanding will eventually be achieved, even if it hasn't happened yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The most intricate and profound concepts in the universe are fundamentally constructed upon basic ideas that anyone, anywhere, can grasp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This universality underscores the belief that anyone, regardless of who or where they are, possesses the inherent capacity to learn anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

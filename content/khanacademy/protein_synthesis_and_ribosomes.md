## Overview
[[translation_and_protein_synthesis | Protein synthesis]] is a fundamental cellular process where genetic information encoded in [[dna_structure_and_replication | DNA]] is converted into functional proteins. Ribosomes are the cellular machinery responsible for this [[translation_and_protein_synthesis | translation]] process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## The Role of Ribosomes
Ribosomes are small complexes found throughout the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. They serve as the sites where [[messenger_rna_and_transcription_process | messenger RNA]] (mRNA), which has been [[gene_expression_and_transcription | transcribed]] from [[dna_structure_and_replication | DNA]] inside the nucleus, is [[translation_and_protein_synthesis | translated]] into proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. Essentially, ribosomes are where genetic information is converted into the functional proteins used throughout the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

### Composition of Ribosomes
Ribosomes are composed of both proteins and [[role_of_rna_in_genetic_processes | RNA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Specifically, ribosomal [[role_of_rna_in_genetic_processes | RNA]] (rRNA) is a structural component that helps the ribosome function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. While some protein components of ribosomes are made by other ribosomes, the ribosomal [[role_of_rna_in_genetic_processes | RNA]] is produced in a specific region of the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

### The Nucleolus: Ribosome Factory
The ribosomal [[role_of_rna_in_genetic_processes | RNA]] and proteins that make up ribosomes are built in a part of the nucleus called the nucleolus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. The nucleolus is not a separate, membrane-bound organelle, but rather a densely packed region of [[dna_structure_and_replication | DNA]], [[role_of_rna_in_genetic_processes | RNA]], and proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. Its density makes it visible under a microscope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. It is the primary site for ribosomal [[role_of_rna_in_genetic_processes | RNA]] production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

## Types of Ribosomes and Protein Destinations
Ribosomes can exist in two main forms within the cell:

*   **Free Ribosomes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>: These ribosomes float freely in the cytosol, the fluid inside the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. Proteins produced by free ribosomes typically remain in the cytosol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
*   **Attached Ribosomes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>: Some ribosomes are attached to the membrane of the [[endoplasmic_reticulum_and_golgi_bodies | endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER), forming what is known as the **rough endoplasmic reticulum** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

Proteins synthesized by attached ribosomes are destined for specific locations, such as cellular membranes or for secretion outside the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. When [[messenger_rna_and_transcription_process | mRNA]] is [[translation_and_protein_synthesis | translated]] by these ribosomes, the newly forming protein chain is pushed into the lumen (inside) of the [[endoplasmic_reticulum_and_golgi_bodies | endoplasmic reticulum]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. From there, proteins can travel through the [[endoplasmic_reticulum_and_golgi_bodies | endoplasmic reticulum]] and eventually to the [[endoplasmic_reticulum_and_golgi_bodies | Golgi bodies]] for further processing and packaging into vesicles for transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

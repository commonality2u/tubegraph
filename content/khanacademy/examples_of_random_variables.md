[[Random variables | Random variables]] are a fundamental concept in probability that map outcomes of random processes to numbers, effectively quantifying those outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This differs from traditional variables found in algebra, which can typically be solved for or assigned specific values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. A [[random_variables | random variable]] can take on many different values, each with its own probability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

## [[definition_of_a_random_variable | Defining Random Variables]]

[[Random variables | Random variables]] are typically denoted by capital letters, such as X or Y <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

### Coin Flip Example (Capital X)

Consider a random process of flipping a fair coin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. A [[random_variables | random variable]] `X` can be defined as follows:
*   `X = 1` if the coin lands on heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>
*   `X = 0` if the coin lands on tails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>

While this `1` for heads and `0` for tails is a common mapping, a [[random_variables | random variable]] could theoretically be defined with any numerical values for the outcomes, such as `X = 100` for heads and `X = 703` for tails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. The key is that the random process's outcomes are quantified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### Dice Roll Sum Example (Capital Y)

Another example involves rolling multiple dice. A [[random_variables | random variable]] `Y` could be defined as the sum of the upward faces after rolling seven dice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. This [[random_variables | random variable]] quantifies the outcome of the random process of rolling the dice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

## Utility of Random Variables

The primary benefit of [[understanding_random_variables | defining random variables]] is to quantify outcomes, which allows for mathematical operations and cleaner notation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. For instance, instead of writing "the probability that the sum of the upward faces after rolling seven dice is less than or equal to 30" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, one can simply write `P(Y â‰¤ 30)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This simplifies expressing probabilities related to a random process's outcomes, such as `P(Y is even)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

The circle is arguably the most fundamental shape in our universe, appearing in the shapes of planetary orbits, wheels, and even on a molecular level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It is worthwhile to understand some of the [[fundamental_properties_of_circles | properties of the circle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Fundamental Properties of a Circle

A circle is defined as all the points that are equidistant from its center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. All points along the edge are equally distant from the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### The Radius

The equal distance from the center to any point on the edge of the circle is called the [[definition_and_role_of_radius_in_circles | radius]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. For example, if a radius is 3 centimeters, any other radius in that circle will also be 3 centimeters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### The Diameter

The [[understanding_the_diameter_and_its_relation_to_the_radius | diameter]] is the distance across the circle at its widest point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This widest point always passes through the center of the circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The diameter is essentially composed of two radii <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

The relationship between the diameter (D) and the radius (r) is straightforward:
$$D = 2r$$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>

## Understanding Circumference

The circumference of a circle is the total distance around its edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. It's like measuring the perimeter of a polygon, but for a circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

### The Significance of Pi (π)

For thousands of years, people observed a consistent ratio when comparing the circumference of any circle to its diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

Initially, with less precise measurements, this ratio seemed to be approximately 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. As measurement techniques improved, it became clear that the ratio was closer to 3.1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. With even greater precision, the number revealed itself to be 3.14159... and continues infinitely without repeating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

Because this number is so fundamental and appears for every circle, it was given a special name: [[explaining_the_significance_of_pi_in_circle_calculations | pi]] (π) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

> [!definition] Pi (π)
> [[explaining_the_significance_of_pi_in_circle_calculations | Pi]] (π) is the ratio of a circle's circumference (C) to its diameter (D) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
> $$ \pi = \frac{C}{D} $$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>

### Calculating Circumference

From the definition of pi, the formula for circumference can be derived:

By multiplying both sides of the ratio by the diameter (D):
$$C = \pi D$$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>

Since the diameter is equal to two times the radius ($D = 2r$), the formula can also be expressed in terms of the radius:
$$C = \pi (2r)$$
$$C = 2\pi r$$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>

## Examples

### Example 1: Finding Circumference and Diameter from Radius

Consider a circle with a [[definition_and_role_of_radius_in_circles | radius]] (r) of 3 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

**1. Calculate the Circumference:**
Using the formula $C = 2\pi r$:
$C = 2 \times \pi \times 3 \text{ meters}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>
$C = 6\pi \text{ meters}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>

**2. Calculate the Diameter:**
Using the formula $D = 2r$:
$D = 2 \times 3 \text{ meters}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>
$D = 6 \text{ meters}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>

### Example 2: Finding Diameter and Radius from Circumference

Consider a circle with a circumference (C) of 10 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

**1. Calculate the Diameter:**
Using the formula $C = \pi D$, we can rearrange to solve for D:
$D = \frac{C}{\pi}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>
$D = \frac{10 \text{ meters}}{\pi}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>
$D = \frac{10}{\pi} \text{ meters}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>

**2. Calculate the Radius:**
Using the formula $r = \frac{1}{2} D$:
$r = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{10}{\pi} \text{ meters}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>
$r = \frac{5}{\pi} \text{ meters}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>

## Expressing Answers with Pi

It is common practice in mathematics to leave answers in terms of [[explaining_the_significance_of_pi_in_circle_calculations | pi]] (e.g., $6\pi$) rather than multiplying it out as a decimal (e.g., 18.849...) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This is because [[explaining_the_significance_of_pi_in_circle_calculations | pi]] is an irrational number with an infinite, non-repeating decimal expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. Pi is a number, similar to any other constant, but it is often represented by its Greek letter for simplicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

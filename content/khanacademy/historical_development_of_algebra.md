The term "algebra" originates from the Arabic word "Al-gabr," meaning "restoration" or "completion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This word, and the association with the ideas [[introduction_to_algebra | algebra]] now represents, comes from a significant book titled in English, "The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Al-Khwarizmi and the Etymology of Algebra
The aforementioned book was written by a Persian mathematician, [[al_khwarizmi_and_the_etymology_of_algebra | Al-Khwarizmi]], around 820 AD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. He lived in Baghdad in the 8th or 9th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

The Arabic title of [[al_khwarizmi_and_the_etymology_of_algebra | Al-Khwarizmi]]'s book is "Al-kitab al-mukhtasar fihisab al-gabr wa'l-muqabala" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Al-kitab**: Book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>
*   **Al-mukhtasar**: Compendious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>
*   **Fihisab**: Calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>
*   **Al-gabr**: Restoration or completion, the root of the word "algebra" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>
*   **Wa'l-muqabala**: Balancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>

[[al_khwarizmi_and_the_etymology_of_algebra | Al-Khwarizmi]] associated "restoration" or "completion" with the operation of moving a term from one side of an equation to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This book is considered highly significant because it was the first time [[introduction_to_algebra | algebra]] began to take on many of its modern ideas, such as balancing equations and approaching problems in an abstract manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Early [[origins_of_algebra | Origins of Algebra]]

While [[al_khwarizmi_and_the_etymology_of_algebra | Al-Khwarizmi]]'s contributions were monumental, the [[origins_of_algebra | origins of algebra]] predate his work.
### Ancient Babylon (circa 2000 BCE)
The earliest known records of people exploring algebraic ideas come from ancient Babylon, around 2000 years Before the Common Era (BCE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Stone tablets from this period show evidence of them working on fundamental algebraic concepts, although they used different symbols and methods of representation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Babylon was located in Mesopotamia, a region historically significant for the [[role_of_civilization_in_the_evolution_of_algebra | evolution of algebra]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

### Diophantus (circa 200-300 AD)
Fast-forwarding to around 200-300 AD, a Greek mathematician named Diophantus (or Diophantus) lived in Alexandria, which was part of the Roman Empire at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Diophantus is sometimes credited as the "father of algebra," though this is debated with [[al_khwarizmi_and_the_etymology_of_algebra | Al-Khwarizmi]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Diophantus focused more on specific problems, whereas [[al_khwarizmi_and_the_etymology_of_algebra | Al-Khwarizmi]] was known for approaching math in a purer, more abstract way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. Both, along with the Babylonians, made unique and [[significant_contributions_to_algebra_by_various_cultures | significant contributions to algebra]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

### Brahmagupta (circa 600 AD)
Around 600 AD, Brahmagupta, a notable Indian mathematician, also made [[significant_contributions_to_algebra_by_various_cultures | significant contributions to algebra]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

## [[al_khwarizmi_and_the_etymology_of_algebra | Al-Khwarizmi]]'s Modern Impact
While earlier civilizations and mathematicians contributed foundational ideas, [[al_khwarizmi_and_the_etymology_of_algebra | Al-Khwarizmi]] is definitively credited with giving algebra its name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. He is considered one of the fathers of [[introduction_to_algebra | algebra]] due to his pioneering efforts in thinking about the field in an [[application_of_abstraction_in_algebra | abstract sense]], separate from specific problems, which aligns with how modern mathematicians approach the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

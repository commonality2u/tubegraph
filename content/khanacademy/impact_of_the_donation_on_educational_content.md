## Expansive Global Reach and Impact

[[khan_academy_origins_and_growth | Khan Academy]] currently boasts 120 million registered users, with 20 to 30 million students using the platform every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Annually, it facilitates approximately 200 million hours of learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Philanthropic Return on Investment
> Efficacy studies indicate that [[khan_academy_origins_and_growth | Khan Academy's]] social [[philanthropic_return_on_investment_in_education | return on investment]] ratio ranges from 400 to 500 to 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This is significantly higher than the typical "good return" in the philanthropic sector, which is considered to be a 5 to 1 or 10 to 1 ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

Despite its progress, Khan emphasized that billions globally still need access to education to tap into their potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. He views this type of investment as foundational for [[khan_academy_origins_and_growth | Khan Academy]] to become a multi-generational institution, ensuring future generations, including "future [[elon_musks_donation_to_khan_academy | Elon Musks]]," can unlock their potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## A Call for Continued Support

Even with this "incredible" donation, [[khan_academy_origins_and_growth | Khan Academy]] was running at a deficit for 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Khan reiterated the need for more help, stating that every donation, regardless of size, enables them to accelerate learning in various dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. He noted that the world spends five trillion dollars annually on education, while [[khan_academy_origins_and_growth | Khan Academy's]] budget is only one one-hundred thousandth of that, comparable to a large high school's budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Despite this, its [[khan_academys_global_educational_aspirations | aspirations are to serve the globe]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Inspiration for a Grand Mission

Sal Khan shared that receiving a donation from [[elon_musks_donation_to_khan_academy | Elon Musk]] was particularly powerful due to their past interactions, including an interview in 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Khan expressed immense admiration for Musk, stating that whenever he questions whether the mission to educate all of humanity is "too big," he thinks of Musk's achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. He observed that nearly everything Musk stated he would do in 2013, despite being "large statements," has either been accomplished or is close to completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

> Khan draws "incredible inspiration" from Musk's success, believing that the mission of educating humanity is "not too big" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Just as humanity should not shy away from solving climate issues, transportation, or colonizing other planets, it should not shy away from educating the planet and beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

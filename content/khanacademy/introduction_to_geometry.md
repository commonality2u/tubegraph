## What is Geometry?

The word "geometry" combines the root word "geo", which refers to the earth (seen in words like "geography" and "geology") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The "metry" part comes from "measurement" (as in "trigonometry" or "metric system") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Therefore, the term "geometry" literally means "earth measurement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

Geometry is a broad subject focused on understanding how shapes, space, and various objects relate to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. It encompasses the study of lines, triangles, circles, angles, patterns, and three-dimensional shapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Many visually mathematical concepts can be categorized within geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Fundamental Elements

### Point

A point is defined as a dot or a specific position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. It's impossible to move *on* a point; moving in any direction means you are no longer at that point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Points specify a position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

To differentiate between multiple points, they are typically given labels, often using letters like A, B, C, or D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. For example, Point A, Point B, Point C, and Point D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

A point has zero [[dimensions_in_geometry | dimensions]] because you cannot travel within it in any direction (up/down, left/right, in/out) while remaining on the point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

### Line Segment

A line segment consists of all the points that connect two specific points along a straight path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. The two specific points where a line segment starts and ends are called its endpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. For example, if A and B are endpoints, the collection of points between them (including A and B) forms line segment AB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

Line segments are labeled using their endpoints with a line drawn above them (e.g., $\overline{AB}$ or $\overline{BA}$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

A line segment is considered a one-[[dimensions_in_geometry | dimensional]] object because movement is only possible along its length (forward or backward) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. Geometrically, a line segment has no width, only length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. The length of a line segment AB is denoted by writing AB without the line above it (e.g., AB = 5 units) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

### Ray

A [[understanding_rays_in_geometry | ray]] starts at one point and extends infinitely in one direction through another point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. The starting point of a [[understanding_rays_in_geometry | ray]] is called its vertex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

A [[understanding_rays_in_geometry | ray]] is labeled by its starting point and another point it passes through, with an arrow indicating the direction of infinite extension (e.g., $\overrightarrow{AD}$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. The order of letters matters when naming a [[understanding_rays_in_geometry | ray]]; $\overrightarrow{AD}$ is different from $\overrightarrow{DA}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. Like a line segment, a [[understanding_rays_in_geometry | ray]] is a one-[[dimensions_in_geometry | dimensional]] figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

### Line

A line is an object that passes through at least two points and extends infinitely in both directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Unlike a line segment, a line never ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

A line is labeled using two points it passes through, with arrows on both ends of the line symbol (e.g., $\overleftrightarrow{EF}$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. Line segments are more commonly studied in geometry due to their finite length, which is crucial for discussing sides of shapes and distances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

## Collinear Points and Midpoint

### Collinear Points

Points are considered **collinear** if they all lie on the same straight line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. For example, if points X, Y, and Z are all on the same line, they are collinear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

### Midpoint

If three collinear points X, Y, and Z are such that the distance between X and Z is equal to the distance between Z and Y (i.e., $\overline{XZ} = \overline{ZY}$), then Z is the **midpoint** of line segment XY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. This means Z is exactly halfway between X and Y <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

## [[dimensions_in_geometry | Dimensions]] in Geometry

*   **Zero [[dimensions_in_geometry | Dimensions]]**: A point has zero [[dimensions_in_geometry | dimensions]] because you cannot move on it in any direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   **One [[dimensions_in_geometry | Dimension]]**: Objects like lines, line segments, and [[understanding_rays_in_geometry | rays]] are one-[[dimensions_in_geometry | dimensional]] because movement is restricted to a single direction (back and forth along the line) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **Two [[dimensions_in_geometry | Dimensions]]**: To have two [[dimensions_in_geometry | dimensions]], movement is possible in two different directions, such as left/right and up/down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. A flat surface like a computer screen is two-[[dimensions_in_geometry | dimensional]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. Geometrically, infinite two-[[dimensions_in_geometry | dimensional]] objects are called **planes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. A finite piece of such a plane, like a piece of paper, could be considered a "plane segment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   **Three [[dimensions_in_geometry | Dimensions]]**: This refers to our three-[[dimensions_in_geometry | dimensional]] space, where movement is possible left/right, up/down, and also in/out (towards or away from the viewer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.
*   **Higher [[dimensions_in_geometry | Dimensions]]**: In advanced mathematics, concepts with more than three [[dimensions_in_geometry | dimensions]] can be studied, though they are difficult to visualize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

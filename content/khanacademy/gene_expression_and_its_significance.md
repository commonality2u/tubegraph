Gene expression refers to the process by which information from a gene is used in the synthesis of a functional gene product, such as a protein [00:04:47]. This process is fundamental to life and relies on the inherent properties of DNA and RNA.

## DNA as the Molecular Basis of Heredity

[[dna_structure_and_its_role_in_heredity | DNA's structure]] as a double helix, or twisted ladder, makes it suitable as the molecular basis of heredity [00:00:05]. This suitability stems from its ability to replicate and to express the genetic information it contains [00:01:11]. A DNA molecule can be tens of millions of base pairs long, with specific sections defining genes [00:00:42].

### DNA Replication
For DNA to be the molecular basis of heredity, it must be replicable [00:01:25]. When a cell divides, the two new cells require the same genetic material [00:01:31]. The process of DNA replication involves splitting the two sides of the DNA ladder [00:01:51]. Each side then serves as a template to construct a new complementary side [00:02:41].

In DNA, specific base pairing occurs:
*   Adenine (A) always pairs with Thymine (T) [00:03:09].
*   Guanine (G) always pairs with Cytosine (C) [00:03:26].

By following these rules, a new complementary strand is built onto each original half, resulting in two identical DNA strands [00:04:17]. This conceptual process is how DNA replication occurs before a cell divides and duplicates itself [00:04:25].

### DNA, Chromosomes, and Genes
While often used interchangeably, it's important to distinguish between DNA, chromosomes, and genes:
*   **DNA**: Refers to the molecule itself, with its sugar-phosphate backbone and sequence of base pairs forming a double helix structure [00:05:17].
*   **Chromosome**: A DNA molecule packaged together with other molecules and proteins to form a broader structure [00:05:32].
*   **Gene**: A specific section of [[dna_structure_and_its_role_in_heredity | DNA]] that codes for a certain type of protein or defines a trait [00:05:42]. Genes can range from several thousand to millions of base pairs long [00:06:17].

## Expression of Genetic Information: DNA to Protein
The information stored in DNA must be expressed to define an organism [00:04:41]. This expression primarily occurs through the creation of proteins.

### The Role of RNA
[[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | RNA]] (ribonucleic acid) is a molecule related to DNA that plays a crucial role in gene expression [00:06:33]. Unlike DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), RNA has a slightly different sugar backbone [00:07:07].

In cells with a [[dna_in_cells_and_the_role_of_nucleus | nucleus]], DNA typically resides within the [[dna_in_cells_and_the_role_of_nucleus | nucleus]], but its information must get outside to be expressed [00:07:41]. One of RNA's primary functions is to act as a messenger, carrying information from a specific section of DNA out of the [[dna_in_cells_and_the_role_of_nucleus | nucleus]] to where it can be [[translation_of_mrna_into_proteins | translated into an actual protein]] [00:07:50].

### Transcription
The process of going from DNA to messenger RNA (mRNA) is called transcription [00:08:04]. Conceptually, transcription is similar to replication. A section of the DNA molecule, corresponding to a gene, is used as a template to construct a complementary strand of RNA, specifically mRNA [00:09:01].

The base pairing rules for RNA synthesis during transcription differ slightly from DNA replication:
*   Adenine (A) in DNA pairs with Uracil (U) in RNA [00:09:33].
*   Thymine (T) in DNA pairs with Adenine (A) in RNA [00:10:09].
*   Guanine (G) in DNA pairs with Cytosine (C) in RNA [00:10:16].
*   Cytosine (C) in DNA pairs with Guanine (G) in RNA [00:10:20].

Once formed, this single strand of mRNA detaches from the DNA and carries the genetic information out of the [[dna_in_cells_and_the_role_of_nucleus | nucleus]] [00:10:27].

### Translation
[[translation_of_mrna_into_proteins | Translation]] is the process where the mRNA sequence is converted into an amino acid sequence, ultimately forming a protein [00:11:01]. This process typically occurs when the mRNA attaches to a ribosome [00:10:44].

Key aspects of translation:
*   **Codons**: Each sequence of three bases on the mRNA molecule is called a codon [00:12:08]. Each codon codes for a specific amino acid [00:12:12].
*   There are 4 possible bases (A, U, C, G) and three positions in a codon, resulting in 4 x 4 x 4 = 64 possible codons [00:12:42].
*   There are 20 possible amino acids, meaning some amino acids are coded for by more than one codon [00:12:56].
*   **tRNA**: Another type of [[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | RNA]], called transfer RNA (tRNA), plays a crucial role by bringing specific amino acids to match the codons on the mRNA [00:13:31]. The tRNA has an anticodon region that complements the mRNA codon [00:13:51].
*   As tRNAs bring amino acids in sequence according to the mRNA codons, these amino acids are linked together, forming a polypeptide chain [00:14:26].

### Significance of Proteins
Proteins are essentially sequences of amino acids put together [00:14:29]. They are the molecules that largely "run life" [00:14:42]. Proteins serve various functions, including acting as enzymes, providing structural support (e.g., muscle is formed from proteins), and performing many other cellular tasks [00:14:56]. They can be thousands or more amino acids long and form complex three-dimensional shapes crucial for their functions [00:15:03]. The entire process of gene expression, from DNA to RNA to protein, is how the information for life is stored and put into action [00:15:15].

Mathematics, and specifically algebra, provides a universal language for understanding the structure of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. As Galileo Galilei stated, "Philosophy is written in that great book which ever lies before our eyes-- I mean the universe-- but we cannot understand it if we do not first learn the language and grasp the symbols in which is written. This book is written in the mathematical language, without which one wanders in vain through a dark labyrinth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This perspective highlights the [[the_fundamental_role_of_algebra_in_mathematics | true point of algebra]]: abstracting core ideas to explain how the universe is structured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## From Concrete Examples to Abstract Expressions

Algebra's power lies in its ability to generalize specific situations into broad concepts.

### Calculating a Specific Discount
Initially, a problem might involve a concrete scenario, such as calculating a 30% discount on a $20 pair of pants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. The calculation for the discount is straightforward:
`Discount = 30% × $20 = 0.30 × $20 = $6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>

### Generalizing for Any Product Price
The first step in abstraction is to generalize the calculation for any product price. Instead of a specific price, a symbol, such as `x`, can represent "the price of the product I want to buy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
`Discount = 30% × x` or `0.30 × x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>
This [[understanding_algebraic_expressions | algebraic expression]] allows for calculating the discount for any product by substituting its price for `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. This is a gradual entry into the [[the_fundamental_role_of_algebra_in_mathematics | abstraction of algebra]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

### Generalizing for Any Percentage Off
Further abstraction involves representing the discount percentage itself with a variable. By letting `p` equal "the percentage off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>, the relationship becomes fully generalized:
`Discount = p × x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>
To simplify and maintain consistency with common algebraic notation, one can define `y` as the `discount` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>, resulting in the [[understanding_relationships_and_equations_in_algebra | equation]]:
`y = p × x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>
This equation represents a fundamental [[understanding_relationships_and_equations_in_algebra | relationship]] where `y` is [[understanding_the_concept_of_equality_in_algebra | equated]] to the product of `p` and `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. The choice of letters or symbols for variables is arbitrary, as long as their representation is consistently tracked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

## The Universal Application of Abstract Relationships

The beauty of such [[the_fundamental_role_of_algebra_in_mathematics | algebraic ideas]] is their applicability across diverse fields, far beyond their initial context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

For example, the relationship `y = p × x` is fundamentally the same as Newton's second law of motion: `Force = Mass × Acceleration` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   If `y` represents `Force` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>
*   `p` represents `Mass` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>
*   `x` represents `Acceleration` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>
Then `Force = Mass × Acceleration` can be rewritten as `y = p × x`, demonstrating they are the exact same underlying idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

This singular equation can be applied in numerous domains:
*   Economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>
*   Finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>
*   Physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>
*   Chemistry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>
*   Computer science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>
*   Logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>
*   Electrical engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>
*   Accounting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>

There is an infinite number of applications for this one equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

## Manipulating Abstractions to Reveal Fundamental Truths

A key aspect of algebra is the ability to [[algebraic_techniques_for_solving_equations | manipulate the abstract]] relationships. What is discovered through these [[algebraic_techniques_for_solving_equations | manipulations]] can then be reapplied to all relevant contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

For instance, if `y = p × x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>, and one wishes to find `y` divided by `x`, one must perform the same operation on both sides of the equation to maintain equality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>:
`y / x = (p × x) / x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>
Because multiplying by `x` and then dividing by `x` cancels out, the expression simplifies to:
`y / x = p` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>
This manipulation reveals a fundamental truth about the relationship, effectively stating that `p` is the ratio of `y` to `x`. This truth applies to every single application where `y = p × x` is valid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

Algebra, by focusing on these abstractions, not only provides tools for solving practical problems but also tells us the true structure of the universe, stripped of specific human definitions and applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. This is why mathematics is often considered the universal language, likely serving as the first common ground for communication with alien life forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

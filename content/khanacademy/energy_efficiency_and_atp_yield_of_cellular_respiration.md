The final stage of [[introduction_to_cellular_respiration | cellular respiration]], the [[electron_transport_chain_and_atp_production | electron transport chain]] (ETC), is crucial for generating the majority of the cell's [[energy_production_through_cellular_respiration | ATP]]. After [[atp_production_and_consumption_in_glycolysis | glycolysis]] and the Krebs cycle, the cell is left with 10 NADHs and 2 FADH2s, primarily located in the matrix of the mitochondria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These molecules serve as electron carriers, and their electrons will be used in the ETC to produce ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

While much of the ETC mechanism is well-established, some details, particularly regarding how certain proteins function, remain active areas of research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## ATP Production from Electron Carriers

Each NADH is indirectly responsible for the production of approximately three ATP molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. In a highly efficient cell, each FADH2 is indirectly responsible for two ATP molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The reason FADH2 yields fewer ATPs is that its electrons enter the [[electron_transport_chain_and_atp_production | electron transport chain]] at a slightly lower [[energy_production_through_cellular_respiration | energy]] level than those from NADH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Mechanism of the Electron Transport Chain

The [[electron_transport_chain_and_atp_production | electron transport chain]] begins with the oxidation of NADH. NADH loses two electrons and a proton, becoming NAD+ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. This NAD+ can then be recycled back into the Krebs cycle and [[atp_production_and_consumption_in_glycolysis | glycolysis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Similarly, FADH2 is oxidized.

These high-energy electrons are then transported through a series of protein complexes and "transition molecules" (like coenzyme Q and cytochrome C) embedded within the inner mitochondrial membrane (cristae) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. As electrons move from one molecule to the next, they transition to progressively lower [[energy_production_through_cellular_respiration | energy]] states, releasing [[energy_production_through_cellular_respiration | energy]] with each step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

The final step of the ETC involves the reduction of [[role_of_oxygen_in_cellular_respiration | oxygen]] to water. The electrons, along with protons, combine with half of a molecular [[role_of_oxygen_in_cellular_respiration | oxygen]] molecule to form water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. This is where [[role_of_oxygen_in_cellular_respiration | oxygen]] serves as the final electron acceptor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

### Proton Pumping and Gradient Formation

The [[energy_production_through_cellular_respiration | energy]] released by the electrons moving through the ETC protein complexes is utilized to actively pump hydrogen protons (H+) from the mitochondrial matrix into the outer compartment (intermembrane space) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

This pumping action creates an electrochemical gradient:
*   The outer compartment becomes more acidic (higher H+ concentration) than the matrix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   An electrical potential difference is established, with the outer compartment becoming slightly positive relative to the matrix due to the accumulation of positive protons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

This gradient represents stored potential [[energy_production_through_cellular_respiration | energy]], as the protons naturally want to move back into the matrix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

## [[atp_synthase_function_and_mechanism | ATP Synthase]] and Chemiosmosis

The inner mitochondrial membrane is largely impermeable to protons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. Protons can only flow back into the matrix through a specialized protein complex called [[atp_synthase_function_and_mechanism | ATP synthase]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

### How [[atp_synthase_function_and_mechanism | ATP Synthase]] Works

The current model suggests that as hydrogen protons pass through the [[atp_synthase_function_and_mechanism | ATP synthase]] complex, they mechanically cause an internal "axle" structure of the protein to spin, similar to a turbine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. This spinning axle induces conformational changes in other parts of the [[atp_synthase_function_and_mechanism | ATP synthase]] protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

These mechanical distortions effectively squeeze ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and an inorganic phosphate group together, driving their combination to form ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. The [[atp_synthase_function_and_mechanism | ATP synthase]] is thought to have multiple sites where this ATP synthesis occurs simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

This process, where the [[energy_production_through_cellular_respiration | energy]] from the proton gradient is used to drive ATP synthesis, is known as chemiosmosis.

## Overall ATP Yield and Efficiency

Considering the average ATP yield from each electron carrier:
*   10 NADH molecules (from [[atp_production_and_consumption_in_glycolysis | glycolysis]] and Krebs cycle) contribute to the production of roughly 30 ATPs (10 NADH x 3 ATP/NADH) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>.
*   2 FADH2 molecules (from Krebs cycle) contribute to the production of roughly 4 ATPs (2 FADH2 x 2 ATP/FADH2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.

When combined with the directly produced ATPs from other [[cellular_respiration_phases | cellular respiration phases]]:
*   2 net ATP from [[atp_production_and_consumption_in_glycolysis | glycolysis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>
*   2 ATP from the Krebs cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>

This brings the total ideal [[efficiency_in_production | ATP production]] from one molecule of glucose to approximately 38 ATPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.

It's important to note that this "ideal" yield of 38 ATPs is not always achieved in living systems. Factors such as proton leakage across the membrane or electrons bypassing some steps can lead to a less than completely [[efficiency_in_production | efficient system]], resulting in a lower ATP yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

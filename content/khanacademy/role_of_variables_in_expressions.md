In [[understanding_arithmetic_and_expressions | basic arithmetic]], one deals with concrete numbers like 23 + 5, 2 × 7, or 3 ÷ 4, where the exact numbers are known and can be calculated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, upon entering the [[understanding_arithmetic_and_expressions | algebraic world]], the concept of variables is introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## What are Variables?

Variables are values within expressions that have the ability to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Their specific value can differ based on the particular context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Variables in Expressions

An expression is fundamentally a statement of value or quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. When variables are part of an expression, the overall value of that expression is dependent on the values assigned to its variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

For instance, consider the expression `x + 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>:
*   If `x` is 1, the expression `x + 5` evaluates to 6 (1 + 5 = 6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   If `x` is -7, the expression `x + 5` evaluates to -2 (-7 + 5 = -2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

Another example of an expression is `y + z`, where both `y` and `z` are variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. The expression's value can be [[solving_arithmetic_expressions_using_order_of_operations | evaluated]] depending on the specific values given to `y` and `z` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## Distinction from Equations

It is important to understand the [[difference_between_expressions_and_equations | distinction between an expression and an equation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   An expression is a statement of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   An equation sets two expressions equal to each other, thereby "equating" them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

In an equation, such as `x + 3 = 1`, if there is only one unknown variable, its value can often be determined, thus constraining the variable's possible value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. For `x + 3 = 1`, `x` must be -2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

However, equations can also contain multiple variables, such as `x + y + z = 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. In such cases, the equation might constrain the variables, but not necessarily define a unique value for each unless other variables are known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. For example, if `y = 3` and `z = 2`, the equation `x + 3 + 2 = 5` simplifies to `x + 5 = 5`, which constrains `x` to be 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

The key takeaway is that a variable's value can change based on the specific context of the problem, whether it's within an expression or an equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

## Evaluating Expressions with Variables

Variables allow expressions to represent different outcomes based on their assigned values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

Consider the expression `x^y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>:
*   If `x = 5` and `y = 2`, the expression [[solving_arithmetic_expressions_using_order_of_operations | evaluates]] to 5² = 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   If `x = -2` and `y = 3`, the expression [[solving_arithmetic_expressions_using_order_of_operations | evaluates]] to (-2)³ = -8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

A more complex expression like `√(x + y) - x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>:
*   If `x = 1` and `y = 8`, substituting these values yields `√(1 + 8) - 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
*   This [[simplifying_expressions | simplifies]] to `√9 - 1`, which is `3 - 1 = 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

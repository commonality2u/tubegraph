When [[multiplying_fractions | multiplying fractions]], the process is straightforward: multiply the numerators together and the denominators together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. For example, to multiply 5/6 by 2/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, the new numerator is 5 × 2, and the new denominator is 6 × 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This results in 10/18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Simplifying After Multiplication

The initial product, such as 10/18, is a correct answer, but it's often preferred to express fractions in their [[simplifying_fractions | lowest terms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. To do this, find common factors between the numerator and denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. For 10/18, both numbers are divisible by 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   Divide 10 by 2 to get 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   Divide 18 by 2 to get 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
Thus, 10/18 simplifies to 5/9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Simplifying Before Multiplication (Premultiplication Simplification)

An alternative and often more efficient approach is to simplify the terms *before* performing the full multiplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This is sometimes referred to as "premultiplication simplification" or "cross-cancellation."

Consider the example: 5/6 × 2/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.
Notice that a numerator (2) and a denominator (6) share a common factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
1.  Divide the numerator 2 by 2, which results in 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
2.  Divide the denominator 6 by 2, which results in 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

The expression effectively becomes 5/3 × 1/3. Now, multiply the simplified terms:
*   New numerator: 5 × 1 = 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   New denominator: 3 × 3 = 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

The result is 5/9, which is already in its [[simplifying_fractions | lowest terms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

> [!INFO] Benefits of Premultiplication Simplification
> Performing simplification before multiplication can make the numbers smaller and easier to work with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. This often makes it easier to recognize common factors and arrive at the simplified answer directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. While both methods yield the same correct answer, the early simplification can be more efficient for complex problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

[[Comparison of factoring and quadratic formula | Completing the Square]] and [[Factoring quadratic equations | Factoring]] are two distinct techniques used to solve [[understanding_components_of_a_quadratic_equation | quadratic equations]]. While both aim to find the solutions for *x*, they employ different methodologies and have varying levels of universal applicability.

### [[Completing the square technique | Completing the Square]]

[[Completing the square technique | Completing the square]] is a technique that transforms a [[understanding_components_of_a_quadratic_equation | quadratic equation]] into a [[Square roots and perfect squares | perfect square]] trinomial on one side, allowing for direct solution by taking the square root <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

*   **Mechanism**: The core idea is to "engineer" the [[understanding_components_of_a_quadratic_equation | quadratic equation]] by adding a specific number to both sides, making one side a [[Square roots and perfect squares | perfect square]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This specific number is found by taking half of the coefficient of the *x* term and squaring it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. For example, in `x² - 4x`, half of -4 is -2, and (-2)² is 4. Adding 4 to the expression `x² - 4x` results in `x² - 4x + 4`, which is a [[Square roots and perfect squares | perfect square]] trinomial `(x - 2)²` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   **Applicability**: This method is highly versatile; it "will work for any [[understanding_components_of_a_quadratic_equation | quadratic equation]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a> and "will always work no matter what the coefficients are or no matter how crazy the problem is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. It is particularly useful for problems with non-integer coefficients, such as fractions, where [[factoring_quadratic_equations | factoring]] becomes "super hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
*   **Foundation for Quadratic Formula**: [[Completing the square technique | Completing the square]] is the mathematical basis for deriving the [[Comparison of factoring and quadratic formula | quadratic formula]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

### [[Factoring quadratic equations | Factoring]]

[[Factoring quadratic equations | Factoring]] involves rewriting the [[understanding_components_of_a_quadratic_equation | quadratic equation]] as a product of two linear expressions (binomials) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. The solutions are then found by setting each linear factor to zero.

*   **Mechanism**: For a standard [[understanding_components_of_a_quadratic_equation | quadratic equation]] `ax² + bx + c = 0`, [[factoring_quadratic_equations | factoring]] typically involves finding two numbers that multiply to *c* (or *ac* in more complex cases) and add up to *b* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This can involve [[Factoring by grouping | factoring by grouping]] for equations with a leading coefficient *a* greater than 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   **Efficiency**: When a [[understanding_components_of_a_quadratic_equation | quadratic equation]] is easily factorable (especially with simple integer coefficients), [[factoring_quadratic_equations | factoring]] can be a "faster way to do the problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   **Limitations**: [[Factoring quadratic equations | Factoring]] is not always straightforward or even possible with integer coefficients. Problems involving fractions, decimals, or non-perfect square solutions make [[factoring_quadratic equations | factoring]] "hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a> or "painful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a> to implement.

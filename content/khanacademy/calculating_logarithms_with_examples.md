A [[introduction_to_logarithms | logarithm]] is the [[inverse_relationship_between_logarithms_and_exponents | inverse]] of taking the [[understanding_exponents | exponent]] of something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The word "logarithm" itself can be seen as strange or unusual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The term "[[logarithm_notation_and_conversion | log]]" is simply short for the word [[introduction_to_logarithms | logarithm]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

While logarithms can seem confusing because they are the [[inverse_relationship_between_logarithms_and_exponents | inverse]] of [[understanding_exponents | exponentiation]]—a concept that can sometimes be confusing itself—they represent a simple idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## Understanding Logarithms

To understand a [[introduction_to_logarithms | logarithm]], consider an exponential expression: If 2 to the third power is equal to 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, which is known from [[understanding_exponents | exponent]] modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, then `log base 2 of 8` is equal to 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

When you [[evaluating_logarithmic_expressions | evaluate a logarithm expression]], the answer is the [[understanding_exponents | exponent]] to which the base would be raised to get the given number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. For example, `log base 2 of 8` asks: "2 to what power is equal to 8?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The answer to this is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

The relationship between an exponential equation and a [[logarithm_notation_and_conversion | logarithm]] is:
If $b^y = x$, then $log_b(x) = y$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

## Examples of Calculating Logarithms

### Finding the Exponent

Here are several examples of finding the exponent value in a logarithm:

*   **`log base 4 of 64`**
    This asks: "4 to what power is equal to 64?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
    Since 4 to the third power is 64 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, `log base 4 of 64` is equal to 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

*   **`log base 10 of 1,000,000`**
    This asks: "10 to what power is equal to 1,000,000?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
    A power of 10 results in 1 followed by the number of zeros indicated by the exponent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
    Since 1,000,000 has six zeros, 10 to the sixth power is 1,000,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
    Therefore, `log base 10 of 1,000,000` is equal to 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

*   **`log base 1/2 of 1/8`**
    This is equivalent to asking: `(1/2)` to what power equals `1/8`? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
    We know that `(1/2)` to the third power is equal to `1/8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
    So, `log base 1/2 of 1/8` is equal to 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

### Finding the Base

Sometimes the base of the logarithm is unknown:

*   **`log base x of 27 = 3`**
    This equation means that `x` to the third power is equal to 27 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
    To find `x`, you need to calculate the cubed root of 27 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
    The number that, when multiplied by itself three times, equals 27 is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
    So, `x` equals 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, meaning `log base 3 of 27` is equal to 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

### Special Cases and Undefined Logarithms

*   **`log base 100 of 1`**
    This asks: "100 to what power is equal to 1?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
    From [[understanding_exponents | exponent]] rules, any number raised to the 0-th power is equal to 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
    So, `100` to the 0 power equals 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
    Therefore, `log base 100 of 1` is equal to 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

*   **`log base 2 of 0`**
    This asks: "2 to some power `x` is equal to 0?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
    There is no number to which you can raise 2 to get 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
    Thus, `log base 2 of 0` is [[undefined_logarithms_and_special_cases | undefined]] or has no solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

*   **`log base 3 of -1`**
    This asks: "3 to some power equals -1?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
    Assuming real numbers, there is nothing you can raise 3 to the power of to get a negative number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
    Therefore, `log base 3 of -1` is [[undefined_logarithms_and_special_cases | undefined]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
    > [!caution] Logarithm Domain
    > For a logarithm to be defined (with a positive base), the number being logged must be greater than 0; it cannot be 0 and it cannot be negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

*   **`log base 8 of 1/64`**
    This asks: "8 to what power equals `1/64`?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
    We know that 8 squared (8 to the second power) is 64 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
    To get a [[logarithms_with_fractions_and_negative_exponents | fraction]] like `1/64`, a [[logarithms_with_fractions_and_negative_exponents | negative exponent]] is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
    8 to the negative 2 power is the same as `1/(8^2)`, which is `1/64` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
    So, `log base 8 of 1/64` is equal to -2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

Further [[properties_of_logarithms | properties of logarithms]] will be explored in future modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

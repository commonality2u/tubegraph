Linear equations can be represented in many ways, but one particularly useful form is [[Slopeintercept form | slope-intercept form]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. This form allows for easy identification of both the slope and the y-intercept of the line it represents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

## Understanding Slope-Intercept Form

While a linear equation like `y = 2x + 3` can be written in an infinite number of equivalent ways—for example, `-2x + y = 3` or `y - 5 = 2(x - 1)`— [[Slopeintercept form | slope-intercept form]] is especially convenient for [[Graphing using slope and intercept | graphing]] and understanding the line's characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>.

The standard [[Slopeintercept form | slope-intercept form]] is `y = mx + b`, where `m` represents the slope and `b` represents the y-intercept.

## Example: y = 2x + 3

Let's explore `y = 2x + 3` to understand how to identify its slope and y-intercept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

### Identifying the Y-Intercept

The y-intercept is the point where the line crosses the y-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. This occurs when `x = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.
For the equation `y = 2x + 3`:
1.  Set `x = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.
2.  `y = 2(0) + 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.
3.  `y = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.

So, the y-intercept is the point `(0, 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. In [[Slopeintercept form | slope-intercept form]], the constant term (`b` in `y = mx + b`) directly gives you the y-coordinate of the y-intercept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>.

### Identifying the Slope

The [[Definition of slope as change in y over change in x | slope]] of a line is defined as the [[Definition of slope as change in y over change in x | change in y over the change in x]] (`Δy/Δx`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>.
Let's find some points for `y = 2x + 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>:
*   If `x = 0`, `y = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.
*   If `x = 1`, `y = 2(1) + 3 = 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.
    *   Here, [[finding_slope_between_two_points | Δx]] (change in x) = `1 - 0 = 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.
    *   [[finding_slope_between_two_points | Δy]] (change in y) = `5 - 3 = 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.
    *   [[Definition of slope as change in y over change in x | Slope]] = `Δy/Δx` = `2/1 = 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>.
*   If `x = 2`, `y = 2(2) + 3 = 7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>.
    *   Here, [[finding_slope_between_two_points | Δx]] = `2 - 1 = 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.
    *   [[finding_slope_between_two_points | Δy]] = `7 - 5 = 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>.
    *   [[Definition of slope as change in y over change in x | Slope]] = `Δy/Δx` = `2/1 = 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>.

As shown by these [[examples_of_calculating_slope_from_various_points | examples]], for every one unit increase in `x`, `y` increases by two units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>. This confirms that the [[consistent_calculation_of_slope_from_any_two_points | slope of the line]] is `2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>. In [[Slopeintercept form | slope-intercept form]], the coefficient of `x` (`m` in `y = mx + b`) directly represents the [[Slope of a line in algebra | slope]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>.

### Graphing the Line

Using these identified points, we can [[Graphing using slope and intercept | graph]] the line `y = 2x + 3`:
*   Plot the y-intercept `(0, 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.
*   From `(0, 3)`, move one unit right (change in x = 1) and two units up (change in y = 2) to reach the point `(1, 5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.
*   Connect these points to draw the [[Slope of a straight line | straight line]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.

The line `y = 2x + 3` has a positive [[Slope of a line in algebra | slope]] of 2 and crosses the y-axis at 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.

## General Rule for Slope-Intercept Form

When a linear equation is written in the form `y = mx + b`:
*   The **slope** is `m` (the coefficient of `x`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>.
*   The **y-intercept** is `b` (the constant term), representing the point `(0, b)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>.

## Another Example: y = -x + 2

Consider the linear equation `y = -x + 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>.
*   **Y-intercept**: The constant term is `2`. So, the y-intercept is `(0, 2)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>.
*   **Slope**: The coefficient of `x` is `-1` (since `-x` is `-1x`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>. So, the [[Slope of a line in algebra | slope]] is `-1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>.

This means that for every one unit increase in `x`, `y` will decrease by one unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>. If `x` increases by two, `y` decreases by two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>. This makes [[understanding_slope_from_a_graph | understanding slope from a graph]] straightforward when the equation is in [[Slopeintercept form | slope-intercept form]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>.

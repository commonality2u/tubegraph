When [[decimals_to_fractions_conversion | converting decimals to fractions]], the resulting fraction may need to be [[simplifying_fractions | simplified]] to its [[methods_for_simplifying_fractions | simplest form]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

## Process

After converting a decimal to a fraction, it is important to check if the fraction can be [[simplifying_fractions | simplified]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

### Example: Converting 0.035 to a Simplified Fraction

1.  **Convert to a fraction**: The decimal `0.035` can be expressed as a fraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Since the last digit `5` is in the thousandths place, the fraction is `35/1,000` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
2.  **Simplify**: To get `35/1,000` into its [[methods_for_simplifying_fractions | simplest form]], divide both the numerator (`35`) and the denominator (`1,000`) by their greatest common divisor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. In this case, both numbers are divisible by `5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
    *   `35 รท 5 = 7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>
    *   `1,000 รท 5 = 200` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>
    *   Thus, the [[simplifying_fractions | simplified]] fraction is `7/200` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

> For verification, [[converting_fractions_to_decimals | converting]] `7/200` back to a decimal should yield `0.035` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

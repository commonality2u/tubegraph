When solving linear equations where a variable is multiplied by a coefficient, a common and efficient method is to [[reciprocal_multiplication_in_equations | multiply by the reciprocal]] of that coefficient on both sides of the equation. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with fractional coefficients.

## Understanding the Notation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>

In algebra, when a number is written directly next to a variable (e.g., `5x`), it implies [[basic_multiplication_concepts | multiplication]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. So, `5x = 20` is the same as asking "5 times what number equals 20?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

Other ways to indicate [[basic_multiplication_concepts | multiplication]] include:
*   A dot (`•`) between numbers or expressions (e.g., `5 • x`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   Parentheses (e.g., `5(x)` or `(3/4)(x)`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
The traditional multiplication sign (`x`) is generally avoided in algebra to prevent confusion with the variable `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## Solving Basic Linear Equations

Consider the equation:
`5x = 20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>

This can be solved by asking "what number times 5 equals 20?", which is 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. However, for more complex numbers, a systematic approach is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

There are two primary methods that are essentially the same:
1.  **[[dividing_both_sides_of_an_equation | Dividing both sides of an equation]]**: [[dividing_both_sides_of_an_equation | Divide both sides]] by the coefficient (the number being multiplied by the variable).
    *   `5x / 5 = 20 / 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>
    *   `x = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>
2.  **[[reciprocal_multiplication_in_equations | Multiplying by the reciprocal]]**: [[reciprocal_multiplication_in_equations | Multiply both sides]] by the reciprocal of the coefficient.
    *   `1/5 • 5x = 1/5 • 20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>
    *   `x = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>

[[reciprocal_multiplication_in_equations | Multiplying by a fraction like 1/5]] is the same as [[dividing_both_sides_of_an_equation | dividing by 5]], assuming an understanding of [[multiplying_fractions | multiplying fractions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This method of [[reciprocal_multiplication_in_equations | multiplying by the reciprocal]] is often preferred when the coefficient is itself a fraction, as it simplifies the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Solving Equations with Fractional Coefficients

Consider the equation:
`-3/4x = 10/13` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>

To solve this algebraically:
1.  **Identify the coefficient**: The coefficient is the number [[basic_multiplication_concepts | multiplying]] `x`, which is `-3/4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
2.  **Find the reciprocal**: The reciprocal of `-3/4` is `-4/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
3.  **[[operations_on_both_sides_of_an_equation | Multiply both sides]] by the reciprocal**:
    *   `-4/3 • (-3/4x) = -4/3 • (10/13)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>
    *   On the left side, `-4/3` and `-3/4` cancel out to `1`, leaving `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
    *   On the right side, perform the [[multiplying_fractions | multiplication]]:
        *   Numerators: `10 • (-4) = -40` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>
        *   Denominators: `13 • 3 = 39` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>
    *   Thus, `x = -40/39` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

It is often simpler to leave fractions as improper fractions rather than converting them to mixed numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

### Checking the Answer

A key advantage of algebra is the ability to check your answer by substituting the solution back into the original equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

For `x = -40/39` in the equation `-3/4x = 10/13`:
1.  Substitute `x`: `-3/4 • (-40/39)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>
2.  Simplify before [[basic_multiplication_concepts | multiplying]] (e.g., cross-cancel common factors):
    *   The `4` in the denominator of `-3/4` and the `40` in the numerator of `-40/39` can be simplified by [[dividing_both_sides_of_an_equation | dividing]] both by 4 (4 becomes 1, 40 becomes 10) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
    *   The `3` in the numerator of `-3/4` and the `39` in the denominator of `-40/39` can be simplified by [[dividing_both_sides_of_an_equation | dividing]] both by 3 (3 becomes 1, 39 becomes 13) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
3.  Perform the [[multiplying_fractions | multiplication]] with the simplified terms:
    *   `(-1/1) • (-10/13)`
    *   A negative times a negative equals a positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
    *   `(1 • 10) / (1 • 13) = 10/13` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>
4.  Compare with the original right side: `10/13 = 10/13` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. The answer is correct.

## Another Example

Solve: `-5/6x = 7/8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>
1.  Reciprocal of `-5/6` is `-6/5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
2.  [[operations_on_both_sides_of_an_equation | Multiply both sides]] by `-6/5`:
    *   `-6/5 • (-5/6x) = -6/5 • (7/8)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>
    *   Left side simplifies to `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
    *   Right side [[multiplying_fractions | multiplication]]:
        *   Simplify `6` and `8` by [[dividing_both_sides_of_an_equation | dividing]] both by 2 (`-6` becomes `-3`, `8` becomes `4`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
        *   `7 • (-3) = -21` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>
        *   `5 • 4 = 20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>
    *   So, `x = -21/20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

### Checking the Answer

Substitute `x = -21/20` into `-5/6x = 7/8`:
1.  `-5/6 • (-21/20)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>
2.  Simplify:
    *   `5` and `20` (divide by 5: `5` becomes `1`, `20` becomes `4`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
    *   `6` and `21` (divide by 3: `6` becomes `2`, `21` becomes `7`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
3.  Perform [[multiplying_fractions | multiplication]]:
    *   `(-1/2) • (-7/4)`
    *   Negative times negative is positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
    *   `(1 • 7) / (2 • 4) = 7/8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>
4.  Compare with the original right side: `7/8 = 7/8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. The answer is correct.

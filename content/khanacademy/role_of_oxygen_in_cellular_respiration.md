[[introduction_to_cellular_respiration|Cellular respiration]] can be divided into approximately three [[cellular_respiration_phases|phases]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The availability of oxygen dictates the pathway that follows [[role_of_enzymes_in_glycolysis|glycolysis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Pathways Based on Oxygen Presence

### With Oxygen
If oxygen is present, the process continues through the Krebs cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, which is involved with citric acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Following the Krebs cycle, the process proceeds to the [[oxidation_and_reduction_processes_in_the_electron_transport_chain|electron transport chain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The [[oxidation_and_reduction_processes_in_the_electron_transport_chain|electron transport chain]] is where the majority of [[energy_efficiency_and_atp_yield_of_cellular_respiration|ATP]] is produced, utilizing raw materials from the earlier [[cellular_respiration_phases|phases]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. [[role_of_nadh_and_fadh2_in_atp_production|NADH]] molecules, generated during [[role_of_enzymes_in_glycolysis|glycolysis]], are later used in the [[oxidation_and_reduction_processes_in_the_electron_transport_chain|electron transport chain]] to produce [[energy_efficiency_and_atp_yield_of_cellular_respiration|ATP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>, with each [[role_of_nadh_and_fadh2_in_atp_production|NADH]] capable of producing three [[energy_efficiency_and_atp_yield_of_cellular_respiration|ATPs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

### Without Oxygen (Fermentation)
If oxygen is not present, [[role_of_enzymes_in_glycolysis|glycolysis]] is followed by fermentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. In humans, fermentation produces lactic acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. In other organisms, it may produce alcohol or ethanol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

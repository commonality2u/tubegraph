[[introduction_to_grammar | Grammar]] is defined as a collection of conventions and rules that govern language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. While both rules and conventions are integral to language, they serve distinct purposes.

## Rules

A rule represents the fundamental requirements necessary for language to be comprehensible to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. These are the absolute minimum standards that must be met for communication to function as intended.

For example, to make a car move forward as designed, its wheels must be on the bottom, not on the roof; this is a rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Similarly, in grammar, rules ensure that sentences are structured in a way that allows a listener or reader to understand the intended meaning.

## Conventions

In contrast, a convention is a widely accepted practice or agreement that, while not strictly necessary for basic understanding, contributes to clarity, formality, or adherence to a particular style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Unlike rules, conventions are not about making language understandable, but rather about how it is *preferably* presented within a given context.

An example of a convention is the idea that all cars should be painted teal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. While a teal car functions just as well as a red or blue one, adhering to the "teal" convention would simply be a stylistic choice, not a functional necessity.

## The Purpose of Grammar Instruction

The goal of learning grammar, particularly Standard American English as presented in these videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, is not to dictate what is "right" or "wrong" in an absolute sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Instead, it aims to provide the tools to effectively harness and utilize language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This is analogous to ensuring a car's "wheels are on straight" (rules) regardless of its "color" (conventions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### [[context_dependency_of_grammar | Context-Dependent Grammar]]

The kind of [[introduction_to_grammar | grammar]] used changes depending on the speaker, the audience, the message, and the manner of communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Individuals use multiple types of grammar throughout their daily lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### [[preexisting_grammar_knowledge | Preexisting Grammar Knowledge]]

Most individuals already possess extensive [[preexisting_grammar_knowledge | grammar knowledge]] simply from living and interacting in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. If one can understand spoken English, they already comprehend a significant amount about grammar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. The purpose of formal instruction is to provide names for this existing knowledge, thereby giving individuals a greater command over it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

It is important to acknowledge that "many Englishes" exist, and all are considered valid, vibrant, and important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. The aim is to empower individuals to use English effectively in any way they choose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

For millennia, humans have observed that different [[properties_of_substances_and_elements | substances]] in their environment possess distinct [[properties_of_substances_and_elements | properties]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. These properties can include how they reflect light, their color, or their state (liquid, gas, or solid) at a given temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Observations also show how these substances [[interaction_and_behavior_of_atoms | react with each other]] under certain conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Examples of such substances include carbon (in graphite form), lead, and gold, all of which can exist in solid, liquid, or gaseous states depending on temperature or reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Air particles like carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen also exhibit different [[properties_of_substances_and_elements | properties]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Elements

The natural question arose: if a substance is continuously broken down into smaller and smaller chunks, is there a smallest unit that still retains the [[properties_of_substances_and_elements | properties]] of that substance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>? The answer is yes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. These pure substances with specific [[properties_of_substances_and_elements | properties]] and reactive behaviors are called [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | elements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

Examples of [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | elements]] include:
*   Carbon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>
*   Lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>
*   Gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>
*   Oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>
*   Hydrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>
*   Nitrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>
*   Silicon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>

Historically, water was considered an [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | element]], but it is now known to be composed of more [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | basic elements]] like oxygen and hydrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. All known [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | elements]] are organized in the [[periodic_table_of_elements | Periodic Table of Elements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.

## The Atom: The Basic Building Block

The most [[basic_building_blocks_of_matter | basic unit]] of any [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | element]] that still retains its [[properties_of_substances_and_elements | properties]] is called an **atom** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>. For example, breaking down carbon eventually leads to a carbon atom, and breaking down gold leads to a gold atom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. If an atom is broken down further, it loses the [[properties_of_substances_and_elements | properties]] of its original [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | element]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

Atoms are incredibly, almost unimaginably, small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. For instance, the width of an average human hair can be spanned by approximately one million carbon atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>. This illustrates the minute scale at which atoms exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>.

## Subatomic Particles

While the atom is the [[basic_building_blocks_of_matter | basic building block]] of an [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | element]], atoms themselves are made up of even more fundamental particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>. The arrangement and number of these fundamental particles define the [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | element]] and its [[properties_of_substances_and_elements | properties]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. Changing the number of these particles can alter the [[properties_of_substances_and_elements | properties]] of an [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | element]] or even change it into a different [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | element]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>.

The three primary subatomic particles are:

### Protons
*   **Definition**: Protons are fundamental particles located in the nucleus (center) of an atom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.
*   **Charge**: They carry a positive charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>.
*   **Defining Element**: The number of protons in an atom's nucleus is what defines the [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | element]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>. This number is known as the **atomic number** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.
    *   For example, hydrogen always has one proton, helium has two, carbon has six, and oxygen has eight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>.
    *   If a carbon atom were to gain a proton, it would become nitrogen; it would no longer be carbon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.
*   **Periodic Table**: The [[periodic_table_of_elements | Periodic Table of Elements]] is ordered by atomic number, which is the number of protons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.

### Neutrons
*   **Definition**: Neutrons are fundamental particles also located in the nucleus of an atom, alongside protons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.
*   **Charge**: They are neutral, meaning they have no electrical charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>.
*   **Variability**: The number of neutrons can vary within atoms of the same [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | element]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>. For instance, Carbon-12 has six protons and six neutrons, while Carbon-14 still has six protons but eight neutrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>. This variation does not change the [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | element]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>.

### Electrons
*   **Definition**: Electrons are fundamental particles that "buzz around" or "jump around" the nucleus of an atom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. They do not orbit in the same way planets orbit a sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>.
*   **Charge**: They carry a negative charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>.
*   **Attraction**: Protons and electrons attract each other due to their opposite charges, which keeps the electrons bound to the nucleus and forms part of the atom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:00">[10:08:00]</a>.
*   **Variability and Chemistry**: The number and configuration of electrons dictate how atoms [[interaction_and_behavior_of_atoms | react with each other]] and form bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>. Electrons can be gained or lost by an atom.

## Atomic Structure and Charge

A simplified model of an atom consists of a central **nucleus** containing protons and neutrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>. Electrons move rapidly around this nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>.

*   **Neutral Atom**: In a neutral atom, the number of electrons is equal to the number of protons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>. For example, a neutral Carbon-12 atom has six protons and six electrons, with their charges canceling out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:30:00">[12:30:00]</a>.
*   **Ions**: Atoms can gain or lose electrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>. If an atom loses an electron, it will have fewer electrons than protons, resulting in a net positive charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:19:00">[12:19:00]</a>. Conversely, if an atom gains an electron, it will have a net negative charge. These charged atoms are called ions.

The intricate [[interaction_and_behavior_of_atoms | interactions]] and configurations of these subatomic particles, particularly electrons, form the foundation of chemistry and allow for the prediction of how different atoms and [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | elements]] will [[interaction_and_behavior_of_atoms | react, bond, or repel each other]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>. This fundamental understanding of the atom, as a [[basic_building_blocks_of_matter | basic building block]] made of even more fundamental components, highlights the complex and fascinating nature of matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:00">[12:44:00]</a>.

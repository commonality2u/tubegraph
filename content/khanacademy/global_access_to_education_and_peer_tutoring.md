Khan Academy, initially known for its collection of educational videos, aims to use technology to humanize education on a global scale, providing widespread access to learning and fostering peer-to-peer support networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

## Origins and Accessibility
The platform began when founder Salman Khan started tutoring his cousins remotely in New Orleans from Boston, initially putting the first YouTube videos up as a supplement for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. An unexpected outcome was that his cousins preferred learning from the YouTube videos rather than in-person tutoring, as it allowed them to pause and repeat without feeling they were wasting his time or being embarrassed if they needed to review old material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This self-paced approach in the intimacy of their own room proved beneficial for getting their brain around new concepts without the pressure of a human asking "do you understand this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

The videos were made public on YouTube, leading to unexpected positive feedback and letters from random people worldwide, confirming the [[impact_of_videobased_learning | impact of videobased learning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. This indicated that the content was helping people significantly, beyond just being "nice to have" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Furthermore, the content was designed to be timeless, potentially helping future generations as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Khan Academy's content is completely free and accessible online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

## Self-Paced Learning and Mastery
Khan Academy promotes a mastery-based learning model where students work on concepts until they achieve proficiency, often by getting 10 questions in a row correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. This approach stands in contrast to traditional classroom models, where students move on to new topics after an exam, even if they haven't fully mastered previous concepts, leading to "Swiss cheese gaps" in their foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. The Khan Academy model encourages experimentation and failure on the way to mastery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

This self-paced learning is crucial for all learners, including those who may need more time on certain concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. In pilot programs, it has been observed that students initially perceived as "slow" often race ahead once they master a foundational concept, challenging traditional labels of giftedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

## Global Reach and Addressing Barriers to Access
The vision extends beyond local districts like Los Altos to a global scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. The platform addresses significant barriers to education for various groups:
*   **Adult Learners**: It provides a discreet way for adult learners to revisit [[basic_skills_development | basic skills development]] or catch up on concepts they may have missed without embarrassment, before returning to college or further education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>. This supports [[lifelong_learning | lifelong learning]] for all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **Students in Developing Countries**: For individuals, such as a street kid in Calcutta who needs to help their family during the day and cannot attend school, Khan Academy offers the flexibility to learn at their own pace for a few hours a day, overcoming time and access constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

## Peer Tutoring and the Global Classroom
A key aspect of Khan Academy's model is the integration of peer tutoring. In classrooms utilizing the platform, teachers can identify students who are proficient in a concept (marked "green" on their [[datadriven_education_and_teacher_feedback | data-driven dashboard]]) and have them act as the first line of support for students who are stuck (marked "red") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. This leverages the human element in education, allowing teachers to focus on targeted interventions and freeing up time for interactive, humanized learning experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. This is part of the [[flipping_the_classroom_model | flipping the classroom model]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

The vision extends beyond individual classrooms. Since the entire system is interconnected, there's no reason why peer-to-peer tutoring cannot happen globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. This means a student in Calcutta could potentially tutor a student in another part of the world, and vice-versa, leading to the emergence of a "global one world classroom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. This embodies [[khan_academys_global_educational_aspirations | Khan Academy's global educational aspirations]]. The platform provides tools like dashboards that allow anyone to become a coach or mentor for their family members or even kids at community centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.

From: [[khanacademy]] <br/> 

The Khan Academy, initially known for its collection of educational videos covering subjects from basic arithmetic to vector calculus, has evolved to incorporate data-driven approaches to learning and teacher feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. With millions of students utilizing the site and watching hundreds of thousands of videos daily, the platform has sought to advance its educational model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Origin and the "Mastery" Model

The initial YouTube videos were created by Salman Khan to tutor his cousins remotely, serving as a supplement for review or refresher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. An interesting development occurred when his cousins preferred the automated version of his teaching because it allowed them to pause, repeat, and review concepts at their own pace without feeling embarrassed or wasting his time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This also meant that when first encountering a new concept, students weren't pressured by immediate human judgment, fostering learning in the intimacy of their own room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

As the videos gained wider public access, feedback indicated that the approach was profoundly helping people, including those struggling with subjects like math <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. This success led to the development of interactive exercises, which serve as the foundation for the mastery-based learning model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. The core paradigm is simple: students must correctly answer 10 questions in a row on a concept before moving on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. This differs fundamentally from traditional classroom settings where students progress to the next topic after a snapshot exam, regardless of achieving full mastery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

> In a traditional classroom, you have a couple of-- homework, lecture, homework, lecture, and then you have a snapshot exam. And that exam, whether you get a 70%, an 80%, a 90% or a 95%, the class moves on to the next topic. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>

This traditional model often creates "Swiss cheese gaps" in students' understanding, leading to struggles in later, more advanced topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. The Khan Academy model encourages experimentation and failure as part of the learning process but *expects* mastery before progression, akin to learning to ride a bicycle until proficiency is achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

The exercises fit into a "knowledge map," starting with [[basic_skills_development | single-digit addition]] and progressing through arithmetic, pre-algebra, algebra, and precalculus, with the vision to expand to subjects like logic, computer programming, grammar, and genetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

## Data in the Classroom: The Los Altos Pilot

Teachers began [[flipping_the_classroom_model | flipping the classroom]], assigning video lectures as homework and utilizing class time for problem-solving and teacher-student interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. This approach allowed students to engage with the video content at their own pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

To further this, Khan Academy piloted a program in the Los Altos school district with fifth and seventh-grade classes, replacing traditional math curricula with the platform's software for roughly half their math class time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. This frees up class time for simulations, games, and practical applications, with students working at their own pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

### Teacher Dashboards and Intervention

A key component of this data-driven model is the live teacher dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. This dashboard provides teachers with comprehensive data on student progress:
*   **Student Status**: Each row represents a student, and each column represents a concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
*   **Proficiency**: Green indicates proficiency in a concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
*   **In Progress**: Blue indicates the student is actively working on a concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.
*   **Stuck Points**: Red highlights students who are struggling or stuck on a concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

This clear visual data allows teachers to quickly identify and intervene with students who need help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. Furthermore, it enables teachers to leverage [[global_access_to_education_and_peer_tutoring | peer tutoring]], by having proficient "green" students assist "red" students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

### Granular Data for Deeper Insights

To maximize the effectiveness of teacher interactions, the system provides granular data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. Teachers can diagnose issues with students by seeing:
*   Time spent daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.
*   Videos watched and where students paused or stopped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.
*   Exercises used and focus areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.
*   Exact problems a student got right (blue) or wrong (red), including their progression to mastery (10 in a row) and their speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. This [[impact_of_videobased_learning | impact of videobased learning]] and practice is visible in the data.

### Impact on Student Pacing and Labels

Allowing students to learn at their own pace (differentiated learning) reveals that students often categorized as "slow" or "gifted" in traditional models may simply learn at different speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. Students who take extra time on one concept often race ahead once they achieve mastery, challenging long-held assumptions about student abilities and labels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

## Humanizing the Classroom through Data

The use of technology and data in the classroom paradoxically serves to "humanize" the educational experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. By moving the "one size fits all" lecture outside the classroom, teachers can dedicate their time to valuable human interaction with students, walking around, and facilitating peer engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

This shifts the relevant metric from "student to teacher ratios" to "student to valuable human time with the teacher" ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>. Instead of teachers spending most of their time lecturing and grading, almost 100% of their time can be spent working directly with students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.

## Teacher-Driven Design and Future Accessibility

The development of these teacher tools and dashboards is highly collaborative and teacher-driven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. Teachers provide feedback and specifications, leading to the creation of features like the "focus graph" to help identify students jumping between topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.

The system is considered ready for widespread adoption and can be used by anyone to become a coach or mentor for children, nephews, cousins, or even kids at organizations like the Boys & Girls Club <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>. The vision extends to a global classroom where students can tutor peers across continents, fostering a "global one world classroom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. This [[lifelong_learning | lifelong learning]] approach, supported by data, also benefits adult learners who can remediate their skills without embarrassment before returning to college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

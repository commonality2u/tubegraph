All cells possess [[dna_structure_and_replication | DNA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. The [[dna_structure_and_replication | DNA]] is considered the most important aspect defining what a living organism is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Within the cell, [[dna_structure_and_replication | DNA]] is present in its chromatin form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Cellular Organization Based on DNA Enclosure

The presence or absence of a membrane around the [[dna_structure_and_replication | DNA]] defines a major classification in the living world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

### Eukaryotes
Cells that possess a membrane around their [[dna_structure_and_replication | DNA]], forming a structure called a nucleus, are known as eukaryotes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Eukaryotes include plants, animals, and fungi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. They tend to be larger and more complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

### Prokaryotes
Organisms that do not have a nucleus are classified as prokaryotes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. The two main groups of prokaryotes are bacteria and Archaea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. While previously thought to be types of bacteria, Archaea are now recognized as a completely separate group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## Gene Expression and Protein Synthesis

The [[gene_expression_and_transcription | DNA]] inside the nucleus is transcribed into [[role_of_rna_in_genetic_processes | mRNA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. This [[role_of_rna_in_genetic_processes | mRNA]] then exits the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

### Ribosomes
[[protein_synthesis_and_ribosomes | Protein synthesis and ribosomes]] are the sites where [[role_of_rna_in_genetic_processes | mRNA]] is translated into proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Ribosomes are complexes composed of proteins and [[role_of_rna_in_genetic_processes | RNA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Ribosomal [[role_of_rna_in_genetic_processes | RNA]] is an integral part of the ribosome's structure, assisting its function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

### Nucleolus
The components of ribosomes, including ribosomal [[role_of_rna_in_genetic_processes | RNA]], are produced in a dense area within the nucleus called the nucleolus (or nucleole) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Unlike other organelles, the nucleolus is not separated by a membrane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

## Protein Transport and Modification

Proteins translated at ribosomes can either float freely in the cytosol (the fluid inside the cell) or be directed to other cellular locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

### Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)
The endoplasmic reticulum is a network of interconnected membranes and tunnels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
*   **Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum (RER):** Portions of the ER with [[protein_synthesis_and_ribosomes | ribosomes]] attached are called the rough ER <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. Proteins destined for membranes or for secretion outside the cell are translated here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. As the protein is produced, it's pushed into the lumen (inside) of the ER <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.
*   **Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum (SER):** Parts of the ER without [[protein_synthesis_and_ribosomes | ribosomes]] are called the smooth ER <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. It has other functions, such as producing hormones and fatty compounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

### Golgi Bodies
Proteins travel from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi bodies, which are stacks of folded membranes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. Here, proteins are further processed and packaged for transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

### Vesicles
Proteins are transported from the Golgi bodies by budding off in small, membrane-bound sacs called vesicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. These vesicles can then float to the outer [[cellular_membrane_structure | cellular membrane]] or other parts of the cell, merging with target membranes to release their contents or embed the proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

## Other Important Organelles

### Lysosomes
Lysosomes are found in animal cells and contain enzymes that help dissolve and digest other substances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>.

### Vacuoles
A vacuole is a general term for a large, membrane-bound organelle that stores substances inside cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. In plants, lytic vacuoles serve a similar function to lysosomes, storing enzymes for dissolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.

### Mitochondria
[[structure_and_function_of_mitochondria_in_cellular_respiration | Mitochondria]] are organelles with inner and outer membranes where [[structure_and_function_of_mitochondria_in_cellular_respiration | cellular respiration]] takes place, converting sugars into ATP (energy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>. [[structure_and_function_of_mitochondria_in_cellular_respiration | Mitochondria]] contain their own [[dna_structure_and_replication | DNA]] and can reproduce independently, leading to the belief that their ancestors were once free-living prokaryotic organisms that developed a symbiotic relationship within larger cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.

### Chloroplasts
Found only in plant cells, chloroplasts are responsible for photosynthesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>. Like [[structure_and_function_of_mitochondria_in_cellular_respiration | mitochondria]], chloroplasts possess their own [[dna_structure_and_replication | DNA]] and [[protein_synthesis_and_ribosomes | ribosomes]], suggesting they too originated as independent prokaryotes that entered into symbiosis with eukaryotic cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.

## Other Cellular Structures

### Cell Wall
Non-animal cells, such as plant cells, possess a cell wall that provides structural strength and rigidity to the outer [[cellular_membrane_structure | cellular membrane]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. In plants, the cell wall is primarily made of cellulose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>.

### Microfilaments
Microfilaments, also known as actin filaments, are internal "pipes" or structures that help give the cell its three-dimensional form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>. They also facilitate movement of substances within the cell and the cell's own movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>.

### Centrioles
In the context of [[role_of_mitosis_and_meiosis_in_human_development_and_reproduction | cell division]] ([[detailed_cell_division_process_in_meiosis | meiosis]] and [[role_of_mitosis_and_meiosis_in_human_development_and_reproduction | mitosis]]), centrioles are structures located just outside the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>. Two centrioles at right angles to each other form a centrosome, which coordinates microtubules during cell splitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>.

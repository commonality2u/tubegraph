A second degree polynomial is often referred to as a [[factoring_quadratic_expressions | quadratic]], a quadratic polynomial, or simply a quadratic expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The defining characteristic of such an expression is that it contains a variable raised to the second power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. In the examples provided, the variable used is `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Examples of Quadratic Expressions
A common example of a quadratic expression is `x squared plus 10x, plus 9` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This expression, like others of its kind, can often be factored into the product of two binomials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Standard Form and Leading Coefficient
For ease of identification and subsequent manipulation (such as [[factoring_quadratics_with_a_leading_coefficient_of_1 | factoring]]), it's beneficial to ensure the quadratic expression is in standard form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. In standard form, the `x` squared term appears first, followed by the `x` term, and then the constant.

The "leading coefficient" refers to the coefficient of the `x` squared term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   Most initial examples of factoring quadratics involve a leading coefficient of `1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. For instance, in `x squared plus 10x, plus 9`, the coefficient of `x` squared is `1`.
*   If a quadratic expression has a negative leading coefficient, such as `negative x squared minus 5x, plus 24` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>, it's often easiest to factor out a `negative 1` from the entire expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. This transforms the expression into a form where the `x` squared term has a positive `1` coefficient, making it easier to apply standard factoring techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. For example:
    ```
    -x^2 - 5x + 24  =  -1 * (x^2 + 5x - 24)
    ```

Quantifying outcomes is the process of mapping the results of random processes to numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This means transforming non-numerical outcomes into a numerical format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This concept is central to understanding [[mapping_outcomes_to_random_variables | random variables]] in probability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Examples of Quantifying Outcomes

*   **Coin Flip:** A common random variable (e.g., capital X) can be defined for a coin flip where:
    *   Heads is mapped to 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>
    *   Tails is mapped to 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>
    While 1 and 0 are typical, outcomes could arbitrarily be mapped to any numbers, such as 100 for heads and 703 for tails, and still constitute a legitimate random variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Dice Rolls:** Another random variable (e.g., capital Y) could be defined as the sum of the upward faces after rolling seven dice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. This again quantifies the outcome of a random process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

## Utility of Quantifying Outcomes

The primary usefulness of quantifying outcomes is to enable mathematical operations and cleaner notation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

*   **Enabling Mathematical Operations:** Once outcomes are numbers, it becomes possible to apply mathematical concepts and calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   **Simplified Mathematical Notation:** Quantifying outcomes allows for more concise and understandable mathematical expressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. For example:
    *   Instead of writing "the probability that the sum of the upward faces after rolling seven dice is less than or equal to 30," one can simply write "the probability that capital Y is less than or equal to 30" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
    *   Similarly, "what's the probability that Y is even?" replaces a lengthy descriptive phrase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

### Distinction from Traditional Variables
It's important to differentiate random variables from traditional algebra variables. Unlike algebraic variables that can be solved for or assigned specific values (e.g., `x + 5 = 6` implies `x = 1`), random variables can take on many different values, each with a specific probability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Therefore, with random variables, it makes more sense to discuss the probability of them equaling, exceeding, or having certain properties, rather than solving for a single fixed value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

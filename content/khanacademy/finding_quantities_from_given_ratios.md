Ratios are expressions that compare quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. They describe how many of one item you have for a given number of another item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Expressing Ratios and Simplification

A ratio can be expressed in several ways:
*   Using a colon: e.g., 10:5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>
*   As a fraction: e.g., 10/5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>
*   Using the word "to": e.g., 10 to 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>

The order of the quantities in a ratio is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. For example, the ratio of horses to dogs (10:5) is different from the ratio of dogs to horses (5:10) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

Just like fractions, ratios can often be [[reducing_ratios_to_simplest_form | reduced to their simplest form]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This is done by dividing both (or all) numbers in the ratio by their greatest common divisor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. For instance, a ratio of 10 horses to 5 dogs (10:5) can be simplified to 2:1, meaning there are 2 horses for every 1 dog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The convention is to generally express ratios in this simplified form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

[[calculating_ratios_with_multiple_items | Ratios can also compare more than two quantities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. For example, a ratio of apples to oranges to strawberries could be 20:40:60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. To simplify, find the largest number that divides into all quantities (in this case, 20) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Dividing each by 20 results in a simplified ratio of 1:2:3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

## Calculating Quantities from Ratios

When given a ratio and a total quantity, you can determine the specific number of each item. This involves understanding the ratio as representing "groups" of items.

### Method for Two Quantities

**Example:** The ratio of boys to girls in a classroom is 2:3. There are 40 students total. How many girls are there? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>

1.  **Find the total parts in the ratio:** Add the numbers in the ratio together.
    *   2 (boys) + 3 (girls) = 5 parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>
    *   This means for every group of 5 students, there are 2 boys and 3 girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

2.  **Calculate the number of groups:** Divide the total quantity by the total parts from step 1.
    *   40 (total students) / 5 (students per group) = 8 groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>

3.  **Determine the quantity for the specific item:** Multiply the number of groups by the ratio part for the item you're interested in.
    *   For girls: 8 (groups) * 3 (girls per group) = 24 girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>
    *   (Optional for boys: 8 groups * 2 boys per group = 16 boys, or 40 total students - 24 girls = 16 boys) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>

### Method for Multiple Quantities

**Example:** The ratio of sheep to chickens to pigs on a farm is 2:5:10. There are 51 animals total. How many chickens are there? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>

1.  **Find the total parts in the ratio:**
    *   2 (sheep) + 5 (chickens) + 10 (pigs) = 17 parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>
    *   This means for every group of 17 animals, there are 2 sheep, 5 chickens, and 10 pigs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.

2.  **Calculate the number of groups:**
    *   51 (total animals) / 17 (animals per group) = 3 groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>

3.  **Determine the quantity for the specific item:**
    *   For chickens: 3 (groups) * 5 (chickens per group) = 15 chickens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>

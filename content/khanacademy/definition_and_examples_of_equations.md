When moving beyond basic arithmetic, mathematics introduces the concept of variables, which are values within [[mathematical_expressions | expressions]] that can change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. These variables become especially important when working with equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## [[difference_between_expressions_and_equations | Difference Between Expressions and Equations]]

It is crucial to understand the [[difference_between_expressions_and_equations | distinction between an expression and an equation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>:
*   An **expression** is a statement of value or quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The value of an expression changes depending on the value of its variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
    *   *Example:* `x + 5` is an expression. If `x = 1`, the expression evaluates to `6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. If `x = -7`, it evaluates to `-2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
    *   *Example:* `y + z` is also an expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   An **equation** sets two [[mathematical_expressions | expressions]] equal to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. The term "equation" comes from the act of "equating" two things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. In an equation, a variable's value might be constrained depending on the context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

## Examples of Equations

### Single Variable Equation
A common type of equation involves a single unknown variable, which can often be solved directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

*   **Example:** `x + 3 = 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>
    *   In this equation, `x` is constrained to a specific value. To find `x`, you ask, "What plus 3 is equal to 1?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
    *   The solution is `x = -2`, because `-2 + 3 = 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

### Multiple Variable Equations

Equations can also involve multiple variables. While these might not immediately constrain a single variable, they establish relationships between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

*   **Example:** `x + y + z = 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>
    *   In this [[understanding_linear_equations | linear equation]], the expression `x + y + z` is set equal to the expression `5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
    *   If values for some variables are known, the equation constrains the remaining variable.
    *   For instance, if `y = 3` and `z = 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>:
        *   The left side becomes `x + 3 + 2`, which simplifies to `x + 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
        *   The equation becomes `x + 5 = 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
        *   This constrains `x` to `0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

The key takeaway is that a variable's value can differ based on the problem's context, especially when it's part of an equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

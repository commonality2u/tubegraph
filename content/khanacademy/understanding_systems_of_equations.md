A [[systematic_approach_to_solving_equations | system of equations]] consists of two or more equations that are considered together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The goal is to find values for the variables that satisfy all equations in the system simultaneously.

## Graphical Interpretation and Its Limitations
In some cases, a system of equations can be represented graphically, especially when dealing with [[linear_equations | linear equations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Each [[linear_equations | linear equation]] in a system represents a line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. These equations can be expressed in various forms, such as standard form, slope-intercept form, or point-slope form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Graphing each line and identifying their intersection point provides a solution to the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. However, visually determining the exact intersection point can be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Algebraic Techniques: The Substitution Method
To find an exact solution for a [[systematic_approach_to_solving_equations | system of equations]] without relying on graphing, [[algebraic_techniques_for_solving_equations | algebraic techniques for solving equations]] can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. One such method is the **substitution method** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, which is one of several [[methods_for_solving_systems_of_equations | methods for solving systems of equations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

The substitution method involves these steps:
1.  Solve one of the equations for one of its variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
2.  Substitute the resulting expression for that variable into the other equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
3.  This creates a single equation with a single unknown variable, which can then be solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
4.  Once one variable's value is found, substitute it back into any of the original equations (or the rearranged one from step 1) to solve for the other variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

### Example 1: Solving a System of Linear Equations
Consider the following [[linear_equations | linear equations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>:
*   x + 2y = 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   3x + 5y = 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>

1.  **Solve for one variable**: Rearrange the first equation to solve for x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>:
    ```
    x + 2y = 9
    x = 9 - 2y <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>
    ```
2.  **Substitute into the second equation**: Substitute the expression `9 - 2y` for `x` into the second equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>:
    ```
    3(9 - 2y) + 5y = 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>
    ```
3.  **Solve for the single unknown (y)**:
    ```
    27 - 6y + 5y = 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>
    27 - y = 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>
    -y = 20 - 27 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>
    -y = -7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>
    y = 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>
    ```
4.  **Substitute y back to find x**: Use the rearranged first equation:
    ```
    x = 9 - 2y <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>
    x = 9 - 2(7) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>
    x = 9 - 14 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>
    x = -5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>
    ```
The solution to the system is x = -5 and y = 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. This means that if these equations were graphed, they would intersect at the point (-5, 7) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

## Application in Word Problems
The substitution method is also useful for solving word problems by translating the given information into a [[systematic_approach_to_solving_equations | system of equations]].

### Example 2: Sum and Difference of Two Numbers
**Problem**: The sum of two numbers is 70, and they differ by 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. What are the numbers?

1.  **Define variables**: Let x be the larger number and y be the smaller number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
2.  **Formulate equations**:
    *   "The sum of two numbers is 70": x + y = 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>
    *   "They differ by 11": x - y = 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>
    This creates a [[systematic_approach_to_solving_equations | system of two equations]] with two unknowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

3.  **Solve using substitution**:
    *   Solve the second equation for x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>:
        ```
        x - y = 11
        x = 11 + y <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>
        ```
    *   Substitute this expression for x into the first equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>:
        ```
        (11 + y) + y = 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>
        11 + 2y = 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>
        2y = 70 - 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>
        2y = 59 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>
        y = 59/2 = 29.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>
        ```
    *   Substitute the value of y back to find x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>:
        ```
        x = 11 + y <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>
        x = 11 + 29.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>
        x = 40.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>
        ```
The two numbers are 40.5 and 29.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

> [!check] Verification
> *   Sum: 40.5 + 29.5 = 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>
> *   Difference: 40.5 - 29.5 = 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>
> The solution satisfies both conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

Regardless of which equation is chosen first or which variable is isolated, the key to [[solving_algebraic_equations | solving algebraic equations]] within a system is to always use both constraints provided by the equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>, ensuring that the solution satisfies every equation in the system.

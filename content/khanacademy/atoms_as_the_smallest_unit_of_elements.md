We humans have observed for thousands of years that different substances possess distinct [[properties_of_substances | properties]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. These [[properties_of_substances | properties]] can include how they reflect light, their color, or their state (liquid, gas, or solid) at a given temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. We also notice how substances [[interaction_of_atoms_and_molecules | react with each other]] under certain conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Examples of such substances include carbon (in its graphite form), lead, and gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. These substances can change state; for instance, gold or lead can become liquid at high temperatures, and carbon can become gaseous when burned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

A fundamental question arises: if you continuously break down a substance into smaller and smaller pieces, is there a smallest unit that still maintains the original substance's [[properties_of_substances | properties]]? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a> The answer is yes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

### Elements
Pure substances with specific [[properties_of_substances | properties]] at certain temperatures and defined reaction behaviors are called [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | elements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Carbon, lead, and gold are all [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | elements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. While historically water was considered an element, we now know it is composed of more basic [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | elements]]: oxygen and hydrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. All known [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | elements]] are listed in the [[periodic_table_of_elements | Periodic Table of Elements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

### The Atom
The most basic unit of any [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | element]] is the atom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. For example, if you continuously divide a piece of carbon, you will eventually reach a single carbon atom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Further breaking down this atom would cause it to lose the [[properties_of_substances | properties]] of carbon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

Atoms are incredibly small, almost unimaginably so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. For instance, the width of an average human hair can span approximately one million carbon atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

### Fundamental Particles of Atoms
Atoms themselves are composed of even more [[fundamental_particles_of_atoms | fundamental particles]]: protons, neutrons, and electrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. The arrangement and number of these [[fundamental_particles_of_atoms | fundamental particles]] define the element and its [[properties_of_substances | properties]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

#### The Nucleus
The protons and neutrons are located at the center of the atom, forming its nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

#### Protons
The number of protons in an atom's nucleus is the defining characteristic of an [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | element]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. This number is known as the atomic number, which is used to order [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | elements]] in the [[periodic_table_of_elements | Periodic Table of Elements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. For example, hydrogen always has one proton, helium has two, and carbon has six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Changing the number of protons fundamentally changes the element; for instance, adding a proton to carbon (six protons) turns it into nitrogen (seven protons) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

#### Neutrons
Neutrons reside in the nucleus alongside protons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Unlike protons, the number of neutrons can vary within atoms of the same element, creating different versions called isotopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. For example, Carbon-12 has six protons and six neutrons, while Carbon-14 still has six protons but eight neutrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

#### Electrons
Electrons "buzz around" or "jump around" the nucleus, though their behavior is more complex than simple planetary orbits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. For a neutral atom, the number of electrons equals the number of protons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Protons carry a positive charge, while electrons carry a negative charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. Unlike charges attract each other, which is why electrons are bound to the positively charged nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. Neutrons, as their name suggests, are neutral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

### Electron Behavior and Chemical Reactions
The behavior and configuration of electrons are central to understanding [[electron_behavior_and_chemical_reactions | chemical reactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Atoms can gain or lose electrons, leading to a net positive or negative charge, which dictates how they [[interaction_of_atoms_and_molecules | interact]] with other atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. If a neutral carbon atom (six protons, six electrons) loses an electron, it would have five electrons and six protons, resulting in a net positive charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. The ability to swap or change the number of these [[fundamental_particles_of_atoms | fundamental particles]] within an atom allows for changes in an atom's [[properties_of_substances | properties]] or even its identity as an [[elements_and_the_periodic_table | element]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

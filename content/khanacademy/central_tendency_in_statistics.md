[[measures_of_central_tendency | Measures of central tendency]] are statistical values that aim to describe the center of a data set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. If you need a single number to represent the middle of a data set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, these measures provide different ways to do so, as there is "no one way of doing it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. The most common [[mean_median_and_mode | measures of central tendency]] include the mean, median, and mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## [[Mean and central tendency | Mean]]

The [[mean in statistics | mean]] is what is typically referred to as the "average" in everyday language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. It is sometimes specifically called the "arithmetic mean" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a> because other ways of calculating a [[mean in statistics | mean]] exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

To calculate the [[mean in statistics | mean]], you sum up all the numbers in a data set and then divide by the total count of numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

**Example Calculation:**
Given the numbers: 23, 29, 20, 32, 23, 21, 33, 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
1.  **Sum the numbers:** 23 + 29 + 20 + 32 + 23 + 21 + 33 + 25 = 206 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
2.  **Count the numbers:** There are 8 numbers in the set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
3.  **Divide the sum by the count:** 206 / 8 = 25.75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

Therefore, the [[mean in statistics | mean]] of this data set is 25.75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## [[Mean median and mode | Median]]

The [[mean median and mode | median]] represents the "middle number" in a data set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

To find the [[mean median and mode | median]]:
1.  **Order the numbers:** Arrange the numbers from least to greatest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
2.  **Identify the middle:**
    *   If there is an odd number of values, the [[mean median and mode | median]] is the single middle number.
    *   If there is an even number of values, there will be two middle numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. In this case, the [[mean median and mode | median]] is the [[mean in statistics | average]] (or [[mean in statistics | mean]]) of these two middle numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

**Example Calculation:**
Given the numbers: 23, 29, 20, 32, 23, 21, 33, 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.
1.  **Order the numbers:** 20, 21, 23, 23, 25, 29, 32, 33 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
2.  **Identify the middle:** With 8 numbers (an even count) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>, the two middle numbers are 23 and 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
3.  **Calculate the average of the two middle numbers:** (23 + 25) / 2 = 48 / 2 = 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

Even if 24 is not originally in the data set, the [[mean median and mode | median]] is 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

## [[Mean median and mode | Mode]]

The [[mean median and mode | mode]] is the number that appears most frequently in a data set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. A data set can have one [[mean median and mode | mode]], multiple modes (bimodal, multimodal), or no [[mean median and mode | mode]] if all numbers appear with the same frequency.

**Example Calculation:**
Given the numbers: 23, 29, 20, 32, 23, 21, 33, 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.
*   20 appears once
*   21 appears once
*   23 appears twice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>
*   25 appears once
*   29 appears once
*   32 appears once
*   33 appears once

Since 23 shows up twice, and every other number shows up only once, 23 is the [[mean median and mode | mode]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

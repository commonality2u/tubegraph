This article provides a primer on perimeter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## What is Perimeter?
Perimeter is essentially the distance required to go around something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Imagine putting a fence around a plot of land or wrapping a tape measure around a figure; the length of that fence or tape would be its perimeter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Calculating Perimeter of Rectangles
A rectangle is a four-sided figure with four right angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. In a rectangle, opposite sides are equal in length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

To find the perimeter of a rectangle, you sum the lengths of all its sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

### Example: Rectangle ABCD
Consider a rectangle labeled ABCD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   If side AB is 7 units long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   And side BC is 5 units long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

Since opposite sides are equal:
*   DC will also be 7 units long (equal to AB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
*   DA (or AD) will also be 5 units long (equal to BC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

The perimeter of rectangle ABCD is calculated as the sum of its sides:
Perimeter = AB + BC + DC + DA
Perimeter = 7 + 5 + 7 + 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>
Perimeter = 24 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Calculating Perimeter of Squares
A square is a special case of a rectangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a> where all four sides are equal in length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, and it also has four right angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

To find the perimeter of a square, you can multiply the length of one side by four (since all sides are equal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### Example: Square with a Known Perimeter
If a square has a perimeter of 36 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>, and we let 'x' represent the length of each side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>:
Perimeter = x + x + x + x = 4x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>
Given perimeter = 36, so:
4x = 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>
To solve for x, divide both sides by 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>:
x = 9 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

Thus, this is a 9-by-9 square, meaning its width is 9 and its height is 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

While this article focuses on perimeter, other related concepts include [[understanding_circumference_and_its_calculation | circumference]] (for circles) and [[how_to_calculate_the_area_of_rectangles | area]]. Area measures the space a figure takes up in two dimensions, often visualized by fitting [[concept_of_area_using_1by1_squares | 1-by-1 squares]] within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Calculating [[calculating_area_for_special_cases_like_squares | area for special cases like squares]] involves squaring the side length, which is where the term "squaring something" originates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. Concepts like [[identifying_perfect_squares | perfect squares]] in algebra, [[completing_the_square_technique | completing the square]], and [[understanding_radicals_and_square_roots | radicals and square roots]] are also related to area calculations.

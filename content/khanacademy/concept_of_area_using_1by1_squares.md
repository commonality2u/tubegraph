## What is Area?
Area is a measure of how much space something takes up in two dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

## The 1x1 Square as a Unit
One way to understand area is by thinking about how many 1-by-1 squares can fit within a given figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. A "1-by-1" square refers to a [[calculating_area_for_special_cases_like_squares | square]] where each side has a length of 1 unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. The area of any figure can be viewed as the number of these 1-by-1 squares that can be placed on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

## Calculating Area for Rectangles
### Example: 5x7 Rectangle
Consider a [[how_to_calculate_the_area_of_rectangles | rectangle]] with sides of length 7 and 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
To find its area, you can imagine fitting 1-by-1 squares into it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   Along one side, you can fit 7 one-by-one squares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   Along the other side, you can fit 5 rows of these squares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>, creating 5 rows and 7 columns of 1-by-1 squares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
The total number of 1-by-1 squares that can fit is found by multiplying the number of squares in each dimension: 5 rows times 7 columns equals 35 total squares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Therefore, the area of this [[how_to_calculate_the_area_of_rectangles | rectangle]] is 35 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

### General Formula
The general method to calculate the area of a [[how_to_calculate_the_area_of_rectangles | rectangle]] is to multiply one dimension (e.g., length) by the other dimension (e.g., width) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. For example, a [[how_to_calculate_the_area_of_rectangles | rectangle]] with dimensions 1/2 by 2 has an area of 1 (1/2 multiplied by 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

### Fractional Dimensions
Even with fractional dimensions, the concept holds: a dimension of 1/2 means you can fit 1/2 of a 1-by-1 square along that dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. If you have two such halves along another dimension, they would combine to form a whole 1-by-1 square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

## Calculating Area for Squares
A [[calculating_area_for_special_cases_like_squares | square]] is a special type of [[how_to_calculate_the_area_of_rectangles | rectangle]] where all sides are equal in length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

### Example: 2x2 Square
For a [[calculating_area_for_special_cases_like_squares | square]] where one side is 2 units long, all sides are 2 units long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. To find its area, you multiply the length by the width, which in this case is 2 times 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. This calculation is also known as "squaring" the number, and it's where the term "squaring" comes from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. The area of a 2x2 [[calculating_area_for_special_cases_like_squares | square]] is 4, as you can easily fit four 1-by-1 squares within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

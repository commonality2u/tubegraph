The domain of a function refers to the set of all valid inputs, or `x` values, for which the function is defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. For a quadratic function, such as `f(x) = 3x² + 6x - 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, its domain is typically all real numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

This means that any real number can be substituted for `x` into the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The operation of squaring the number, multiplying it by 3, adding 6 times the number, and then subtracting 2, can be performed with any real number input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Real vs. Imaginary/Complex Numbers

When discussing the domain, it's important to clarify what "real numbers" entail. While most numbers encountered in traditional mathematics are real numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, there are also [[complex_numbers | imaginary and complex numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. However, for typical quadratic functions, the domain is considered to be all real numbers, encompassing virtually all numbers except for complex numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Domain of `f(x) = 3x² + 6x - 2`

For the function `f(x) = 3x² + 6x - 2`, the domain is all real numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This means there are no restrictions on the `x` values that can be input into the function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

Chemistry is a science that helps us understand, model, and predict our reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. It is central to making sense of the vast complexity observed in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Common Associations with Chemistry

When people think of chemistry, they often visualize scientists working with vials of chemicals, some boiling and changing colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Other common associations include [[introduction_to_chemical_equations | chemical equations]] that describe how substances react <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, models of molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, and the [[role_of_periodic_table_in_chemistry | periodic table of elements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. All of these are indeed significant aspects of chemistry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Simplifying Universal Complexity

The universe presents an overwhelming array of different substances, from fire and rock to water, meteorological patterns, and the complexities of life like the human brain with its electrochemical interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This apparent infinite spectrum of distinct substances can seem daunting to comprehend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

Over [[historical_evolution_and_significance_of_chemistry | thousands of years of human beings]], we have gradually begun to understand this complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The insight provided by chemistry is that despite this diversity, everything is fundamentally made of [[basic_building_blocks_of_matter | basic building blocks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. These "legos" of existence are not infinite in number but finite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

Many seemingly different things are simply varied compositions of [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | elements]] such as carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Furthermore, [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | elements]] themselves are composed of protons, electrons, and neutrons, which are rearranged to give [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | elements]] their unique properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## Chemistry's Place Among Sciences

Chemistry fits into a hierarchy of sciences that explain reality:
*   **Mathematics** is considered the purest level, studying ideas and logical concepts that may exist independently of observation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. It could even be a common language for communication with other intelligent species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **Physics** builds upon mathematics by exploring the fundamental constituents of matter and the mathematical properties describing their interactions at the most basic level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   **Chemistry** is closely related to [[interrelation_of_chemistry_physics_and_biology | physics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. It utilizes math and [[interrelation_of_chemistry_physics_and_biology | physics]] to understand how different building blocks interact to explain phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. The interactions between [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | atoms]] are quantum mechanical interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   **Biology** is built upon chemistry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Biological processes, such as those occurring within a human being, are based on molecular interactions between molecules and [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | atoms]], which are fundamentally chemical in nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Even speech is the result of countless chemical interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
*   Sciences like psychology and economics further build upon these foundations, leveraging mathematics and other principles to explain broader aspects of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

These sciences are not hierarchical in importance but rather provide different lenses through which to study fascinating aspects of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. Chemistry, in particular, builds models to understand interactions at scales and speeds that cannot be directly observed, enabling predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

## The Ongoing Journey of Discovery

Learning chemistry is a privilege, as the knowledge available today was sought by people centuries ago who would have done anything to access it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. While we have a strong start in understanding, none of these scientific fields are complete, and our knowledge is still partial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. There is arguably infinitely more to learn, but the excitement lies in the progress made and the sense we are beginning to make of our reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

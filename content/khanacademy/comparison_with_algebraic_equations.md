A **differential equation** describes a relationship between a function and its derivatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55]</a>. This contrasts with more familiar [[algebraic_techniques_for_solving_equations | algebraic equations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08]</a>.

## Defining an Algebraic Equation

An [[algebraic_techniques_for_solving_equations | algebraic equation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11]</a> is typically what one encounters first in mathematics, such as a simple quadratic equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19]</a>.

For example:
```
x² + 3x + 2 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21]</a>
```

## Nature of Solutions

### Differential Equations
The solution to a differential equation is a function, or a class of functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36]</a>. It is not merely a single value or a set of discrete values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41]</a>. The objective is to find functions where the relationship between the function and its derivatives holds true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17]</a>.

### Algebraic Equations
In contrast, the solutions to an [[solving_algebraic_equations | algebraic equation]] are numbers, or a set of numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30]</a>.

For the example `x² + 3x + 2 = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21]</a>:
We can [[solving_algebraic_equations | solve]] this equation by factoring it into `(x + 2)(x + 1) = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35]</a>.
This yields solutions:
*   `x = -2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41]</a>
*   `x = -1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45]</a>

These are specific numerical values that satisfy the [[understanding_relationships_and_equations_in_algebra | equation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53]</a>.

## Summary of Differences

While both involve [[understanding_relationships_and_equations_in_algebra | equations]], the fundamental [[difference_between_expressions_and_equations | difference]] lies in what they represent and the nature of their solutions:

*   **[[understanding_relationships_and_equations_in_algebra | Algebraic Equation]]**: A relationship between variables where the solution is a value or set of values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47]</a>.
*   **Differential Equation**: A relationship between a function and its derivatives where the solution is a function or a set of functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55]</a>.

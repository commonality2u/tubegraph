The [[multiplication_properties_and_concepts|distributive property]] is a fundamental concept in arithmetic and algebra, allowing for the simplification of expressions that combine [[understanding_basic_multiplication|multiplication]] with [[addition_and_multiplication_relationship|addition]] or subtraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. It is essentially what one already knows from arithmetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## How it Works

When an expression like `2(3x + 5)` is given, it literally means "two `(3x + 5)`" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This can be understood as:
`(3x + 5) + (3x + 5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

Looking at this expanded form, there are two `3x` terms and two `5` terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Therefore, the expression `2(3x + 5)` is equivalent to:
`2(3x) + 2(5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

This process is known as "distributing" the `2` to each term inside the parentheses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Example 1: Simplifying `2(3x + 5)`

To simplify `2(3x + 5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>:
1.  Distribute the `2` to `3x`: `2 * 3x = 6x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
2.  Distribute the `2` to `5`: `2 * 5 = 10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
3.  Combine the results: `6x + 10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

Thus, `2(3x + 5)` simplifies to `6x + 10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### Example 2: Simplifying `7(3y - 5) - 2(10 + 4y)`

This example involves distributing a negative number and combining like terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

The original expression is `7(3y - 5) - 2(10 + 4y)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

#### Step 1: Simplify the Left-Hand Side (`7(3y - 5)`)

*   Distribute `7` to `3y`: `7 * 3y = 21y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   Distribute `7` to `-5` (being careful with the sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>): `7 * -5 = -35` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   Result for the left side: `21y - 35` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

#### Step 2: Simplify the Right-Hand Side (`-2(10 + 4y)`)

It's helpful to think of this as distributing `-2` rather than `2` and then subtracting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

*   Distribute `-2` to `10`: `-2 * 10 = -20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   Distribute `-2` to `4y`: `-2 * 4y = -8y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   Result for the right side: `-20 - 8y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

#### Step 3: Combine the Simplified Parts

Now, put the simplified parts back together:
`(21y - 35) + (-20 - 8y)`

#### Step 4: Combine Like Terms

*   Combine `y` terms: `21y - 8y = 13y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. If you have 21 of something and take away 8 of them, you are left with 13 of that something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   Combine constant terms: `-35 - 20 = -55` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

#### Final Simplified Expression

The entire expression `7(3y - 5) - 2(10 + 4y)` simplifies to `13y - 55` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

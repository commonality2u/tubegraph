The [[quadratic_formula_introduction | quadratic formula]] is derived from a process called [[completing_the_square_technique | completing the square]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. If one applies the [[completing_the_square_technique | completing the square technique]] to the general form of a quadratic equation (axÂ² + bx + c = 0), the resulting solution is the [[quadratic_formula_introduction | quadratic formula]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. The derivation process will be detailed in a subsequent discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.

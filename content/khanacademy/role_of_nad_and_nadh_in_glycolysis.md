[[overview_of_glycolysis | Glycolysis]] is a crucial biochemical pathway that occurs in almost all life forms, involving the breakdown of glucose into two pyruvate molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Beyond the direct production of ATP, [[overview_of_glycolysis | glycolysis]] also involves the reduction of NAD+ to NADH, a vital step for further energy generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## NAD+ Reduction to NADH
During [[overview_of_glycolysis | glycolysis]], specifically in a reaction facilitated by a dehydrogenase enzyme, NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) undergoes [[nad_reduction_to_nadh_during_glycolysis | reduction to NADH]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Reduction, in this context, means gaining electrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. NAD+ gains a hydrogen and an electron, effectively gaining a hydride anion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

> [!INFO] Definition of NAD+
> NAD+ stands for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. It is described as a decent-sized molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

For every glucose molecule processed through [[overview_of_glycolysis | glycolysis]], two NAD+ molecules are reduced to two NADH molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This occurs when glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate is further processed, gaining an additional phosphate group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

## Role of NADH in Cellular Respiration
The NADH produced during [[overview_of_glycolysis | glycolysis]] is crucial for subsequent stages of [[glycolysis_and_its_role_in_cellular_respiration | cellular respiration]]. Once formed, NADH can be oxidized in the [[role_of_nadh_and_fadh2_in_electron_transport_chain | electron transport chain]] (part of oxidative phosphorylation) to generate even more ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

> [!NOTE] NADH as an Energy Carrier
> The two NADH molecules generated per glucose molecule can be utilized later in the [[role_of_nadh_and_fadh2_in_electron_transport_chain | electron transport chain]] to produce additional ATP, significantly contributing to the overall energy yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

If oxygen is available, the products of [[overview_of_glycolysis | glycolysis]], including NADH, move into the mitochondria for further processes like the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. In the absence of oxygen, cells undergo anaerobic respiration or fermentation, which is primarily about replenishing NAD+ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

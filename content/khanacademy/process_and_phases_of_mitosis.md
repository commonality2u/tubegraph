Mitosis is a fundamental cellular process that leads to the creation of new cells. It is often [[comparison_of_mitosis_and_meiosis | comparing mitosis to meiosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Starting Cell and Chromosome Number

The process of mitosis begins with a cell that has a diploid number of chromosomes, denoted as 2n <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. For human beings, this means the cell starts with 46 chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. These 46 chromosomes are comprised of 23 homologous pairs, with 23 chromosomes typically inherited from the mother and 23 from the father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Outcome of Mitosis

After the process of mitosis and cytokinesis, the result is two cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Each of these new cells contains the same genetic information as the original cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a> and also has the diploid number of chromosomes (2n) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## The Mitotic Cycle

Mitosis is considered a cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. After a cell undergoes mitosis, it can enter interphase again, grow, replicate its DNA and centrosomes, and then undergo mitosis once more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This cyclical nature allows for continuous cell division and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## [[role_of_mitosis_and_meiosis_in_human_development_and_reproduction | Role of Mitosis]]

Mitosis is the primary mechanism by which most cells in the human body grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. It is how a single-cell organism develops into a multicellular organism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Location in the Body

Mitosis primarily occurs in **somatic cells** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, which constitute the majority of the body's tissues and organs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Additionally, **germ cells** can also undergo mitosis to produce more germ cells that maintain a diploid number of chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

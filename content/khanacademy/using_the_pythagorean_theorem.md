The [[introduction_to_the_pythagorean_theorem | Pythagorean theorem]] is a fundamental concept in geometry primarily used with [[understanding_right_triangles | right triangles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. It states that the square of the [[Calculating the Hypotenuse and Other Sides | hypotenuse]] (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This relationship allows for the calculation of unknown side lengths or the verification of a triangle's properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Calculating the Hypotenuse

To find the [[Calculating the Hypotenuse and Other Sides | hypotenuse]] of a [[understanding_right_triangles | right triangle]] when the lengths of the other two sides are known, apply the [[applying_the_pythagorean_theorem | Pythagorean theorem]]:

*   **Formula**: If `h` is the [[Calculating the Hypotenuse and Other Sides | hypotenuse]] and `a` and `b` are the other two sides, then `h^2 = a^2 + b^2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

**Example 1:**
Consider a [[understanding_right_triangles | right triangle]] with side lengths of 7 and 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

*   Let `a = 7` and `b = 4`.
*   Calculate `h^2`: `h^2 = 7^2 + 4^2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>
*   `h^2 = 49 + 16` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>
*   `h^2 = 65` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>
*   To find `h`, take the square root of both sides: `h = √65` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>
*   The square root of 65 cannot be simplified further as 65 is `13 * 5`, and both 13 and 5 are prime numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Verifying Triangle Side Lengths

The [[applying_the_pythagorean_theorem | Pythagorean theorem]] can also be used to verify if a given set of side lengths correctly forms a [[understanding_right_triangles | right triangle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

**Example 2:**
Consider a triangle with side lengths 2, `2√3`, and 4, where 4 is the [[Calculating the Hypotenuse and Other Sides | hypotenuse]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

*   Square the two shorter sides: `(2√3)^2` and `2^2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
    *   `(2√3)^2 = 4 * 3 = 12` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>
    *   `2^2 = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>
*   Sum the squares: `12 + 4 = 16` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>
*   Compare this sum to the square of the [[Calculating the Hypotenuse and Other Sides | hypotenuse]]: `4^2 = 16` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>
*   Since `16 = 16`, these side lengths satisfy the [[applying_the_pythagorean_theorem | Pythagorean theorem]], confirming it is a [[understanding_right_triangles | right triangle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. This specific example represents a 30-60-90 triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> The principles of [[application_of_trigonometry_in_right_triangles | trigonometric functions]] like sine, cosine, and tangent are also directly applicable only within the context of [[understanding_right_triangles | right triangles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

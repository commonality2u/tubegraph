[[introduction_to_negative_numbers|Negative numbers]] are any numbers less than zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. While they might seem abstract initially, they are commonly encountered in everyday life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Real-World Examples

### Temperature
When measuring temperature, especially in Celsius, values can drop below zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. For example, if the temperature is 3 degrees Celsius and it gets 4 degrees colder, the temperature will be -1 degree Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

On a temperature scale (which acts like a number line), moving to the left of zero indicates colder temperatures or smaller numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This illustrates [[understanding_negative_numbers_on_a_number_line|understanding negative numbers on a number line]] where:
*   -1 is less than 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>
*   -3 is less than -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>
*   -100 is much smaller than -1, indicating a greater lack of heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Bank Accounts
Consider having $10 in a bank account. If you then spend $30, and the bank allows you to spend more than you have, your account balance will be -$20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. This negative balance means you owe the bank money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

## [[using_a_number_line_for_adding_and_subtracting|Using a Number Line]]
A number line is a useful tool for visualizing [[negative_number_arithmetic|negative number arithmetic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   Moving to the right on a number line increases the value (adding) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   Moving to the left on a number line decreases the value (subtracting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. This means numbers become smaller, potentially going below zero into negative values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

## Practice Problems

### [[subtracting_negative_numbers|Subtracting]] a Positive Number
To subtract a positive number, move to the left on the number line.

*   **3 - 4**
    Starting at 3, move 4 units to the left:
    *   1 unit left: 2
    *   2 units left: 1
    *   3 units left: 0
    *   4 units left: -1
    Therefore, 3 - 4 = -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

*   **2 - 8**
    Starting at 2, move 8 units to the left:
    *   Move 2 units left to reach 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
    *   You still need to move 6 more units to the left (8 - 2 = 6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
    *   Moving 6 units left from 0 results in -6.
    Therefore, 2 - 8 = -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

*   **-4 - 2**
    Starting at -4, move 2 units to the left:
    *   1 unit left from -4: -5
    *   2 units left from -4: -6
    Therefore, -4 - 2 = -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

### [[adding_negative_numbers|Adding]] a Positive Number
To add a positive number, move to the right on the number line.

*   **-3 + 2**
    Starting at -3, move 2 units to the right:
    *   1 unit right from -3: -2
    *   2 units right from -3: -1
    Therefore, -3 + 2 = -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

Understanding these movements on the number line is key to [[dealing_with_negative_numbers_in_equations|dealing with negative numbers]] in equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

[[introduction_to_negative_numbers | Negative numbers]] are any numbers less than zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Although they may initially seem abstract, [[realworld_examples_of_negative_numbers | negative numbers]] are commonly encountered in everyday life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## [[realworld_examples_of_negative_numbers | Real-World Examples of Negative Numbers]]

### Temperature
When measuring temperature, such as in Celsius, zero degrees represents a specific point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. If the temperature starts at 3 degrees Celsius and drops 4 degrees colder, it goes below zero to -1 degree Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. This demonstrates that moving to the left of zero on a number line signifies colder temperatures and smaller values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. For instance, -3 degrees Celsius is colder and thus less than -1 degree Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. A temperature of -100 degrees Celsius is much smaller than -1 degree Celsius, indicating a greater lack of heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Bank Accounts
Consider a scenario where you have $10 in a bank account and spend $30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. If the bank allows you to spend more money than you have, your account balance will become negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Starting at $10 and subtracting $30 results in a balance of negative $20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. A negative balance of -$20 means that you owe the bank $20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

## [[visualizing_negative_numbers_on_a_number_line | Visualizing Negative Numbers on a Number Line]]

Using a number line helps to [[visualizing_negative_numbers_on_a_number_line | visualize negative numbers]] and their operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>:
*   Moving to the right of zero increases values (positive direction) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, such as when adding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   Moving to the left of zero decreases values (negative direction) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>, such as when [[subtracting negative numbers | subtracting]] or getting colder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Numbers can extend infinitely to the left of zero, becoming more and more negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

## [[arithmetic_examples_with_negative_numbers | Arithmetic Examples with Negative Numbers]]

When [[adding negative numbers | adding]] and [[subtracting negative numbers | subtracting]] [[negative numbers]], visualize the movement on a number line:

*   **3 - 4:** Starting at 3, move 4 units to the left. This results in -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   **2 - 8:** Starting at 2, move 8 units to the left. First, 2 units left brings you to 0. Then, another 6 units left brings you to -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   **-4 - 2:** Starting at -4, move 2 units further to the left. Subtracting 1 unit from -4 yields -5, and subtracting another 1 unit yields -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.
*   **-3 + 2:** Starting at -3, move 2 units to the right (since you are [[adding negative numbers | adding]]). Adding 1 unit from -3 yields -2, and [[adding negative numbers | adding]] another 1 unit yields -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

These [[arithmetic_examples_with_negative_numbers | examples]] illustrate how [[adding negative numbers | adding]] and [[subtracting negative numbers | subtracting]] [[negative numbers]] extends the traditional understanding of arithmetic to values below zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. More [[arithmetic_examples_with_negative_numbers | examples]] will be covered in future videos, including [[understanding_subtracting_a_negative_is_the_same_as_adding_a_positive | subtracting a negative number]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

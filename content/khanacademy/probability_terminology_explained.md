This article provides an [[basic_overview_of_probability | overview]] of fundamental terms used in [[basic_probability_concepts | probability]]. Using the example of pulling marbles from a bag, key concepts such as "probability," "event," "trial," and "sample space" are clarified, aiding in [[calculating_probability_of_an_event | calculating the probability of an event]]. This is a common way for [[understanding_probability_through_marbles_example | understanding probability through marbles example]].

## What is Probability?

[[basic_probability_concepts | Probability]] (often denoted as 'p') is a way of measuring the likelihood that something is going to happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. It quantifies how many desired outcomes meet specific criteria compared to the total number of possible outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Key Terms Illustrated with a Marble Example

Consider a bag containing 3 yellow, 2 red, 2 green, and 1 blue marble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The goal is to find the probability of pulling a yellow marble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### Event

The **event** (or event in question) is the specific outcome or constraint being sought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. In this example, the event is "picking a yellow marble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. The desired outcomes are those that satisfy this event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

### Trial

A **trial** refers to the action or experiment being performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. In the marble example, the trial is "picking a marble out of a bag" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

### Sample Space (Possible Outcomes)

The **sample space** is the set of all possible outcomes from a trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, also referred to as the "possible outcomes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. It lists every individual result that could occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

For the given bag of marbles:
*   3 yellow marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>
*   2 red marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   2 green marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>
*   1 blue marble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>

The total number of possible outcomes (the size of the sample space) is 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 8 marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Calculating Probability

To [[calculating_probability_of_an_event | calculate the probability]] of an event, the general formula is:

$$P(\text{Event}) = \frac{\text{Number of outcomes that satisfy the event}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}}$$

In the marble example:
*   Number of outcomes that satisfy the event (picking a yellow marble): There are 3 yellow marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   Total number of possible outcomes (size of the sample space): There are 8 marbles in total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

Therefore, the probability of picking a yellow marble is 3/8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This simple concept forms the basis of [[basic_concepts_in_probability_and_statistics | basic concepts in probability and statistics]].

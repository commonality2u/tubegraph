Irrational numbers are a class of numbers that cannot be represented as the [[rational_numbers_and_integer_representation | ratio of two integers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, unlike [[rational_numbers_and_integer_representation | rational numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Many of the most famous numbers in mathematics are irrational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

## Defining Characteristics

A key characteristic of irrational numbers, when expressed as decimals, is that they neither terminate nor repeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. This distinguishes them from [[repeating_decimals_as_rational_numbers | repeating decimals]] or finite decimals, which are [[repeating_decimals_as_rational_numbers | rational numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

## Examples of Irrational Numbers

Some noteworthy examples of irrational numbers include:
*   **Pi (π)**: The ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Its decimal representation goes on forever without repeating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **e (Euler's Number)**: This number appears in continuously compounding interest and complex analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Like Pi, its decimal form never terminates or repeats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   **Square Root of 2 (√2)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>
*   **Phi (Φ)**: Also known as the Golden Ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

Many numbers that "pop out of nature" are irrational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Generally, the square root of any non-perfect square will result in an irrational number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

## Prevalence and Operations

While irrational numbers may seem exotic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>, they are not uncommon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   There is always at least one irrational number between any two [[rational_numbers_and_integer_representation | rational numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>, and in fact, an infinite number of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This suggests that there are not fewer irrational numbers than [[rational_numbers_and_integer_representation | rational numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   The sum of an irrational number and a [[rational_numbers_and_integer_representation | rational number]] is always irrational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   The product of an irrational number and a [[rational_numbers_and_integer_representation | rational number]] is always irrational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

There are many irrational numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

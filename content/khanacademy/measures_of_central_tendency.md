[[Central tendency | Central tendency]], or the average of a data set, describes different ways to represent the typical value of a data set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. It helps understand where the numbers lie in a distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

## Arithmetic Mean

The [[arithmetic_mean | arithmetic mean]] is a common measure of [[central_tendency | central tendency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. To calculate the [[arithmetic_mean | mean]], sum all the numbers in the data set and divide by the count of the numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

### Examples

Consider two data sets:

*   **Data Set 1:** -10, 0, 10, 20, 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>
    *   Sum: -10 + 0 + 10 + 20 + 30 = 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>
    *   Number of data points: 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>
    *   [[Arithmetic mean]]: 50 / 5 = 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>

*   **Data Set 2:** 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>
    *   Sum: 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 = 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>
    *   Number of data points: 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>
    *   [[Arithmetic mean]]: 50 / 5 = 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>

Both data sets have the exact same [[arithmetic_mean | arithmetic mean]] of 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. However, they are clearly different in how spread out their values are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Data Set 2's numbers are very close to 10 (e.g., 12 is only two away from 10), while Data Set 1's numbers are further from 10 (e.g., 0 is 10 away, -10 is 20 away, 30 is 20 away) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This highlights the need for [[measures_of_dispersion | measures of dispersion]] in addition to [[central_tendency | central tendency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

### Population vs. Sample Mean

When discussing the [[arithmetic_mean | mean]] in statistics, it's important to understand the difference between a population and a sample <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. If the data set includes the entire population of data, it is referred to as the population mean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. In situations where only a subset or "sample" of the data is available, methods are used to estimate values for the entire population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

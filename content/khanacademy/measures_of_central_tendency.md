From: [[khanacademy]] <br/> 
[[Central Tendency | Measures of central tendency]] are single values that attempt to describe a set of data by identifying the central position within that data set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. There is no single "best" way to represent the middle of a data set; different measures serve different purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### [[Mean median and mode | Mean]]

The [[mean_median_and_mode | mean]], often referred to as the [[mean_and_central_tendency | average]] in everyday language, is calculated by summing all the numbers in a set and then dividing by the total count of numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. It is sometimes specifically called the *arithmetic mean* because other methods exist for calculating a mean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

**Example Calculation:**
Given the numbers: 23, 29, 20, 32, 23, 21, 33, 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.
1.  **Sum the numbers:** 23 + 29 + 20 + 32 + 23 + 21 + 33 + 25 = 206 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
2.  **Count the numbers:** There are 8 numbers in the set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
3.  **Divide the sum by the count:** 206 / 8 = 25.75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
    *   The mean is 25.75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### [[Understanding median | Median]]

The [[understanding_median | median]] is the middle number in a data set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. To find the median, the numbers must first be ordered from least to greatest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

**Example Calculation:**
Given the numbers: 23, 29, 20, 32, 23, 21, 33, 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.
1.  **Order the numbers from least to greatest:** 20, 21, 23, 23, 25, 29, 32, 33 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a> to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
2.  **Identify the middle number(s):** Since there are 8 numbers (an even count) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, there will be two middle numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. In this ordered list, these are 23 and 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
3.  **Calculate the average of the two middle numbers:** (23 + 25) / 2 = 48 / 2 = 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
    *   Even if the calculated median (e.g., 24) is not present in the original data set, it is still the correct median <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

### [[Mean median and mode | Mode]]

The [[mean_median_and_mode | mode]] is the number that appears most frequently in a data set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

**Example Calculation:**
Given the numbers: 23, 29, 20, 32, 23, 21, 33, 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.
*   Most numbers appear once.
*   The number 23 appears twice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
    *   Therefore, 23 is the mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

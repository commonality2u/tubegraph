[[Descriptive statistics | Descriptive statistics]] involve different ways to represent the "average" or [[mean_and_central_tendency | central tendency]] of a data set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While a previous video covered various [[central_tendency_measures | central tendency measures]], this article will demonstrate the calculation of the [[mean_in_statistics | arithmetic mean]] and introduce the concept of data spread or [[measures_of_dispersion | dispersion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## The Arithmetic Mean

The [[mean_in_statistics | arithmetic mean]] is a common [[central_tendency_measures | central tendency measure]] calculated by summing all data points and dividing by the number of points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This video assumes the data sets represent entire populations, thus dealing with the population mean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

### Example Data Set 1
Consider the data set: -10, 0, 10, 20, 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
The [[mean_in_statistics | arithmetic mean]] is calculated as follows:
(-10 + 0 + 10 + 20 + 30) / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>
= 50 / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>
= 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>

### Example Data Set 2
Consider another data set: 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
The [[mean_in_statistics | arithmetic mean]] is calculated as follows:
(8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12) / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>
= 50 / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>
= 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>

### Comparison of Means
Both data sets have the exact same [[mean_in_statistics | arithmetic mean]] of 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. However, despite having the same average, the sets of numbers are clearly different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

The numbers in the second data set (8, 9, 10, 11, 12) are very close to their mean of 10, with the furthest number being only two units away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. In contrast, the numbers in the first data set (-10, 0, 10, 20, 30) are much further from their mean of 10, with some being 10 or even 20 units away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. This highlights that while [[mean_median_and_mode | mean]], median, and mode (other [[central_tendency_in_statistics | central tendency measures]]) provide an "average" or "center" value, they do not convey how spread out the data points are. For that, [[measures_of_dispersion | measures of dispersion]] are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## The Grand Mission

Despite the current reach of [[Khan Academy and online education | Khan Academy]], which serves 20 to 30 million students monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, its budget is significantly smaller than the global education spending, which totals five trillion dollars annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Sal Khan emphasizes that the mission to [[Global education and accessibility | educate all of humanity]] is not "too big" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. He draws inspiration from ambitious goals like solving climate change, transforming transportation, and colonizing other planets, stating that humanity "cannot shy away" from the goal of [[Global education and accessibility | educating the planet and other planets]] going forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

The organization continues to seek support to [[Impact of donations on Khan Academys growth | accelerate learning]] in various dimensions and encourages donations of all sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. The journey towards these aspirations is a shared one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

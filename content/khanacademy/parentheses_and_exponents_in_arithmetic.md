Order of operations is a fundamental concept in mathematics, providing a consistent way to interpret and solve mathematical statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07"></a>. Without an agreed-upon order, the same expression could lead to multiple different answers, making calculations unreliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32"></a>. For example, if "7 + 3 × 5" were interpreted by first adding 7 and 3 (result: 10), then multiplying by 5, the answer would be 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42"></a>. However, if multiplication were performed first (3 × 5 = 15), then 7 was added, the answer would be 22 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13"></a>. Such discrepancies are "completely unacceptable" in mathematics, especially for critical applications like launching satellites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44"></a>.

## The Agreed-Upon Order of Operations

The established sequence for performing operations is as follows:
1.  **Parentheses** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06"></a>
2.  **Exponents** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10"></a>
3.  **Multiplication and Division** (performed from left to right) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30"></a>
4.  **Addition and Subtraction** (performed from left to right) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40"></a>

If multiple operations are at the same level of priority (e.g., both multiplication and division, or both addition and subtraction), they are performed from left to right within the expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45"></a>. The only exception to the left-to-right rule is when an expression contains *only* addition or *only* multiplication, in which case the order does not matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09"></a>.

## Parentheses

Parentheses are denoted by "little curly things around numbers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08"></a>, such as `(7 + 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19"></a>. Operations inside parentheses take the highest priority in the order of operations and must be calculated first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06"></a>.

### Example: Using Parentheses
Consider the expression: `7 + 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19"></a>`× 4 ÷ 2 - 5 × 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29"></a>

1.  **Parentheses:** First, simplify `(7 + 3)` to `10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51"></a>.
    The expression becomes: `10 × 4 ÷ 2 - 5 × 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06"></a>

2.  **Multiplication and Division (left to right):**
    *   Perform `10 × 4` first (leftmost multiplication/division) to get `40` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15"></a>.
        The expression is now: `40 ÷ 2 - 5 × 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23"></a>
    *   Perform `40 ÷ 2` next to get `20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22"></a>.
        The expression is now: `20 - 5 × 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25"></a>
    *   Perform `5 × 6` to get `30` (multiplication has priority over the remaining subtraction) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27"></a>.
        The expression is now: `20 - 30` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29"></a>

3.  **Addition and Subtraction:**
    *   Finally, perform `20 - 30` to get `-10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30"></a>.

The correct interpretation of the expression is `-10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35"></a>.

## Exponents

Exponents appear as "little small numbers up in the top right" of a base number, such as `7²` (seven squared) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19"></a>. They are performed after parentheses and before multiplication or division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10"></a>. This particular video does not include examples with exponents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24"></a>.

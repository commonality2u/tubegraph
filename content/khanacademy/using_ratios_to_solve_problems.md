Ratios are expressions used to compare quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. They tell you how much of one quantity there is in relation to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Expressing Ratios

Ratios can be written in several ways:
*   Using a colon: For 10 horses and 5 dogs, the ratio of horses to dogs can be expressed as 10:5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   As a fraction: 10/5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   Using the word "to": 10 to 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

All these expressions convey the same comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The quantity written first or on top corresponds to the first part of the ratio (e.g., horses in "horses to dogs") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## [[reducing_ratios | Reducing Ratios]]

Just like fractions, ratios can be reduced to their simplest form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. To do this, find the greatest common divisor of the numbers in the ratio and divide each quantity by it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

For example, a ratio of 10 horses to 5 dogs (10:5) means there are 2 horses for every 1 dog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This is found by dividing both 10 and 5 by their greatest common divisor, which is 5, resulting in 2:1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. The general convention is to present ratios in their simplest, or reduced, form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

## Order Matters in Ratios

The order of quantities in a ratio is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. If the ratio of horses to dogs is 10:5 (or 2:1), then the ratio of dogs to horses would be 5:10, which reduces to 1:2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Whatever order the items are requested, the ratio should follow that same order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

## [[ratios_with_multiple_quantities | Ratios with Multiple Quantities]]

Ratios can compare more than two quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. For example, if you have 20 apples, 40 oranges, and 60 strawberries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>, the ratio of apples to oranges to strawberries is 20:40:60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

To reduce this ratio, find the largest number that divides into all three quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. In this case, it's 20. Dividing each number by 20 gives a reduced ratio of 1:2:3 (1 apple for every 2 oranges and 3 strawberries) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## [[understanding_ratios_in_different_scenarios | Understanding Ratios in Different Scenarios]] (Solving Problems)

Ratios can also be used to find specific quantities when the total amount is known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

### Example 1: Students in a Classroom

If the ratio of boys to girls in a classroom is 2:3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, and there are 40 students total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>, here's how to find the number of girls:

1.  **Understand the "group"**: The ratio 2:3 means for every 2 boys, there are 3 girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. This means for every 5 students (2 boys + 3 girls), there are 2 boys and 3 girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
2.  **Calculate the number of groups**: Divide the total number of students by the sum of the ratio parts (the group size): 40 students / 5 students/group = 8 groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
3.  **Find the specific quantity**: Since each group has 3 girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>, and there are 8 groups, the total number of girls is 8 groups \* 3 girls/group = 24 girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
    *   Similarly, for boys: 8 groups \* 2 boys/group = 16 boys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
    *   (Check: 24 girls + 16 boys = 40 students) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

### Example 2: Farm Animals

If the ratio of sheep to chickens to pigs is 2:5:10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, and there are a total of 51 animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>, find the number of chickens:

1.  **Understand the "group"**: For every 2 sheep, 5 chickens, and 10 pigs, there are 17 animals in total (2 + 5 + 10 = 17) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.
2.  **Calculate the number of groups**: Divide the total animals by the sum of the ratio parts: 51 animals / 17 animals/group = 3 groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.
3.  **Find the specific quantity**: Each group has 5 chickens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. So, 3 groups \* 5 chickens/group = 15 chickens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.

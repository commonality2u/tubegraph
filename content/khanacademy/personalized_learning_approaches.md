From: [[khanacademy]] <br/> 

[[Khan Academy and online education|Khan Academy]], known for its vast collection of videos, offers a unique approach to [[the journey of learning|learning]] that emphasizes personalization and mastery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. The platform hosts approximately 2,200 videos covering topics from basic arithmetic to vector calculus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>, attracting millions of students monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

## Origins of Personalized Learning

The concept originated when Salman Khan began remotely tutoring his cousins in New Orleans while working as a hedge fund analyst in Boston <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. He started uploading YouTube videos as a supplementary resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

A surprising outcome was his cousins' preference for the YouTube lessons over in-person tutoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. This preference highlighted key benefits of the self-paced, video-based format:
*   **Flexibility and Repetition** Students could pause and repeat explanations without feeling as though they were wasting the tutor's time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.
*   **Reduced Embarrassment** Learners could review foundational concepts they might have forgotten from weeks or years prior without embarrassment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.
*   **Self-Paced Progress** Students could watch at their own time and pace, skipping ahead if they were bored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.
*   **Reduced Pressure** The absence of an immediate human judgment ("do you understand this?") during the initial struggle with a new concept allowed for more intimate and focused [[the learning process from simple to complex|learning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

The widespread adoption of these videos, evidenced by positive feedback from diverse learners, including a 12-year-old with autism who struggled with math <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>, underscored their profound impact beyond simple supplementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.

## Mastery-Based Learning

[[Khan Academy and online education|Khan Academy]] transitioned from a collection of videos to a comprehensive [[Khan Academy and online education|online education]] platform, integrating practice exercises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>. The core paradigm for these exercises is achieving "10 in a row" correct answers to demonstrate mastery before moving on to the next concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>.

This approach fundamentally differs from traditional classroom models:
*   **Addressing "Swiss Cheese" Gaps** Traditional classrooms often move students forward after snapshot exams, even if they've only achieved 70-95% proficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>. This can lead to "Swiss cheese" gaps in foundational knowledge that cause difficulties in later, more advanced topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>.
*   **Emphasis on Mastery** The personalized model encourages students to persist, experiment, and even [[the importance of failure in learning|fail]] repeatedly until they achieve mastery, similar to how one would learn to ride a bicycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>. The traditional model penalizes experimentation and failure and does not expect mastery, whereas [[Khan Academy and online education|Khan Academy]] encourages them while demanding mastery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>.
*   **Knowledge Map** Concepts are organized into a knowledge map, starting with basic skills like single-digit addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>. Mastery of one concept unlocks more advanced modules, creating a clear progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>. This map can extend to various subjects, including computer programming, grammar, and genetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:00">[10:43:00]</a>.

## Application in Classrooms: [[Flipping the classroom model|Flipping the Classroom]]

Teachers began adopting [[Khan Academy and online education|Khan Academy]] videos to [[flipping_the_classroom_model|flip the classroom]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>. In this model, lectures are assigned as homework using the videos, and class time is dedicated to problem-solving and interactive work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>.

This shift has a profound effect on the classroom environment:
*   **Humanizing Education** By moving the "one size fits all" lecture out of the classroom, teachers are freed up to facilitate a more humanized experience. They can walk around, observe, and interact directly with students, allowing for peer-to-peer collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>.
*   **Personalized Support** Teachers can leverage [[datadriven_insights_in_education|data-driven insights in education]] to identify students who are struggling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00">[12:06:00]</a>. In pilot programs, such as one in the Los Altos school district, teachers use live dashboards to monitor student progress: green for proficient, blue for working, and red for stuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a>.
*   **Efficient Teacher Intervention** This data allows teachers to intervene precisely where needed, or even to encourage proficient students to tutor their peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>. Detailed data shows what videos students watched, when they paused, and which problems they got right or wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>.
*   **Revealing True Potential** This self-paced model often reveals that students labeled as "slow" in traditional settings, when given enough time, often race ahead and demonstrate capabilities comparable to those previously considered "gifted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:00]</a>. This suggests that perceived academic differences are often a "coincidence of time" rather than inherent ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:23:00">[14:23:00]</a>.

## Broader Impact and Future Vision

The benefits of personalized [[the learning process from simple to complex|learning]] extend beyond local schools to impact [[global education and accessibility|global education and accessibility]]:
*   **Increased Teacher-Student Interaction** The focus shifts the "student to valuable human time with the teacher" ratio, allowing teachers to spend nearly 100% of their time interacting directly with students rather than lecturing or grading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>.
*   **Accessibility for Diverse Learners** It caters to adult learners who might be embarrassed to review basic concepts before returning to college, or to individuals in challenging circumstances, such as a street kid in Calcutta who needs to help their family during the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22:00">[15:22:00]</a>. They can learn without embarrassment at their own pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:40:00">[15:40:00]</a>.
*   **Global Peer Tutoring** The system facilitates peer-to-peer tutoring beyond a single classroom, envisioning a "global one world classroom" where students from different parts of the world can tutor each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:54:00">[15:54:00]</a>.
*   **Motivation and Engagement** [[growth_mindset|Game mechanics]], such as badges, energy points, and leaderboards, are integrated to motivate students and encourage progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:06:00">[17:06:00]</a>. Even subtle changes in wording or points awarded can significantly influence student engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:31:00">[17:31:00]</a>.

This personalized approach is ready for widespread adoption and represents a significant step towards the future of education, fostering [[universality_of_learning_capability|learning capability]] and mastery for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:16:00">[19:16:00]</a>.

In a market, the **equilibrium price** and **equilibrium quantity** represent the point where the amount of a good or service supplied perfectly matches the amount demanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This concept is fundamental to understanding [[market_dynamics_and_adjustments | market dynamics]].

## Understanding Demand and Supply

To illustrate, consider the market for apples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Market analysis typically involves a graph where the vertical axis represents the price per pound, and the horizontal axis represents the quantity of apples in thousands of pounds for a given period, such as a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

### Demand Curve
The demand curve illustrates the relationship between price and the [[difference_between_quantity_demanded_and_demand | quantity demanded]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. According to the [[law_of_demand_in_microeconomics | law of demand]], if the price of apples is very high, consumers will demand less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. For example, at $5 a pound, the [[difference_between_quantity_demanded_and_demand | quantity demanded]] might be around 500 pounds, whereas at $1 a pound, it could be 4,000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This inverse relationship creates a downward-sloping demand curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### Supply Curve
The supply curve shows the relationship between price and the quantity suppliers are willing to produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. There is often a minimum price below which suppliers are unwilling to produce at all, such as 50 cents for apples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. As the price increases, suppliers are incentivized to produce more. For instance, at $1 a pound, suppliers might offer 1,000 pounds, with the quantity supplied increasing with higher prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This direct relationship results in an upward-sloping supply curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## Market Imbalances and Adjustments

Markets naturally tend towards equilibrium through [[market_dynamics_and_adjustments | adjustments]] when there is a [[market_shortages_and_surpluses | shortage or surplus]].

### Shortage
A [[market_shortages_and_surpluses | shortage]] occurs when the [[difference_between_quantity_demanded_and_demand | quantity demanded]] exceeds the quantity supplied at a given price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

*   **Example:** If apple suppliers initially price their apples at $1 per pound, they might supply 1,000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. However, at this price, the [[difference_between_quantity_demanded_and_demand | quantity demanded]] is much higher, perhaps 4,000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. This creates a [[market_shortages_and_surpluses | shortage]] of 3,000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Adjustment:** In a shortage, consumers will bid up prices because there aren't enough apples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. As prices rise, producers are encouraged to supply more, moving up the supply curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Concurrently, the higher prices will cause the [[difference_between_quantity_demanded_and_demand | quantity demanded]] to decrease, moving up the demand curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. This dual movement helps alleviate the shortage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

### Surplus
A [[market_shortages_and_surpluses | surplus]] occurs when the quantity supplied exceeds the [[difference_between_quantity_demanded_and_demand | quantity demanded]] at a given price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

*   **Example:** If suppliers, perhaps overestimating demand, set the price at $3 per pound, they might plan to supply 3,000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. At this higher price, the [[difference_between_quantity_demanded_and_demand | quantity demanded]] could be only 1,300 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. This results in a [[market_shortages_and_surpluses | surplus]] of 1,700 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   **Adjustment:** With a surplus of unsold apples that may spoil, producers will start reducing prices to attract consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. As prices fall, producers will also reduce the quantity they supply, moving down the supply curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Simultaneously, the lower prices will increase the [[difference_between_quantity_demanded_and_demand | quantity demanded]], moving down the demand curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. This process reduces the surplus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

## Defining Equilibrium

Both shortages and surpluses lead to market forces that push the price and quantity towards a central point where the supply and demand curves intersect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

*   **Equilibrium Price:** This is the price at which the quantity supplied equals the [[difference_between_quantity_demanded_and_demand | quantity demanded]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. In the apple market example, this might be around $2.15 per pound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
*   **Equilibrium Quantity:** This is the quantity at which the market clearsâ€”all apples produced at the equilibrium price are sold, and all consumers who want apples at that price can purchase them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. In the example, this quantity might be approximately 2,200 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

At the equilibrium, there are no apples left unsold, and no consumers are unable to find apples at the prevailing price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. This represents an efficient state for both consumers and producers, assuming no other [[factors_influencing_changes_in_demand_and_quantity_demanded | factors change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

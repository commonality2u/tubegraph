This article explores the concepts of equilibrium price and quantity within a market, using the example of apples, and demonstrates how market forces naturally lead to this equilibrium state.

## Market Setup: The Apple Market
In an apple market, economists analyze both [[demand vs quantity demanded | demand]] and supply for apples at different prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. A graph is typically used, where the vertical axis represents the price per pound, and the horizontal axis represents the quantity of apples in thousands of pounds for a set period, such as a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## [[Supply and demand curves | Demand Curve]]
The [[Supply and demand curves | demand curve]] illustrates the relationship between price and the quantity consumers are willing to buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
If the price of apples were very high (e.g., $5 a pound), consumers would not [[demand vs quantity demanded | demand]] much, resulting in a low [[demand vs quantity demanded | quantity demanded]] (e.g., 500 pounds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Conversely, if the price were low (e.g., $1 a pound), the [[demand vs quantity demanded | quantity demanded]] would be higher (e.g., 4000 pounds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. The [[Supply and demand curves | demand curve]] shows this entire relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## [[Supply and demand curves | Supply Curve]]
The [[Supply and demand curves | supply curve]] shows the relationship between price and the quantity producers are willing to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
Below a certain price (e.g., 50 cents), producers may not be willing to supply any apples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. As the price increases, the quantity producers are willing to supply also increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. For instance, at $1 per pound, suppliers might be willing to supply 1000 pounds, and this quantity increases with price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This supply curve represents all suppliers in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Market Scenarios and [[Price adjustments and market dynamics | Price Adjustments]]

### Scenario 1: Shortage
If suppliers set the price too low, such as $1 per pound, a [[Market shortages and surpluses | shortage]] will occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   At $1 per pound:
    *   [[Consumer and producer behavior in response to price changes | Quantity supplied]] is 1000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
    *   [[effects of price changes on quantity demanded | Quantity demanded]] is 4000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   This creates a [[Market shortages and surpluses | shortage]] of 3000 pounds of apples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

In a [[Market shortages and surpluses | shortage]] situation, consumers will bid up the price of the limited apples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. As prices rise, producers will be incentivized to increase the [[Consumer and producer behavior in response to price changes | quantity supplied]], moving up along the [[Supply and demand curves | supply curve]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

### Scenario 2: Surplus
If suppliers set the price too high, such as $3 per pound, a [[Market shortages and surpluses | surplus]] will occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   At $3 per pound:
    *   [[Consumer and producer behavior in response to price changes | Quantity supplied]] is 3000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
    *   [[effects of price changes on quantity demanded | Quantity demanded]] is much lower, around 1300 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
*   This creates a [[Market shortages and surpluses | surplus]] of 1700 pounds of apples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

In a [[Market shortages and surpluses | surplus]] situation, producers will reduce prices to sell off excess apples before they go bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. As prices fall, the [[Consumer and producer behavior in response to price changes | quantity supplied]] will decrease, moving down along the [[Supply and demand curves | supply curve]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

## Equilibrium: The Balancing Point
Both [[Market shortages and surpluses | shortage]] and [[Market shortages and surpluses | surplus]] situations naturally lead the market towards a point where the [[Supply and demand curves | supply]] and [[Supply and demand curves | demand curves]] intersect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This intersection represents the **equilibrium price** and **equilibrium quantity**.

*   **Equilibrium Price**: This is the price at which the [[Consumer and producer behavior in response to price changes | quantity supplied]] equals the [[effects of price changes on quantity demanded | quantity demanded]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. In the apple market example, this was approximately $2.15 per pound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
*   **Equilibrium Quantity**: This is the quantity at which the [[Consumer and producer behavior in response to price changes | quantity supplied]] equals the [[effects of price changes on quantity demanded | quantity demanded]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. For the apple market example, this was around 2200 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

At equilibrium, assuming no other changes, the market is balanced: all apples produced are sold, and none go bad, making it a favorable scenario for both consumers and producers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

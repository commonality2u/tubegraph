Expanding binomials to higher powers can quickly become a laborious task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This difficulty can lead to common misconceptions about how to correctly expand them.

## What is a Binomial?
A binomial is an algebraic expression consisting of two terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. For example, `a + b` is a binomial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Common Misconception: The "Square It All" Fallacy
A frequent error when taking [[parentheses_and_exponents_in_arithmetic | powers of binomials]] is incorrectly assuming that `(a + b)²` is equal to `a² + b²` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This is incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

> "a plus b squared is not a squared plus b squared." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>

## Correct Expansion of (a + b)²
To correctly expand `(a + b)²`, one must remember that it means `(a + b)` multiplied by `(a + b)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

Following the distributive property (or FOIL method):
*   `a` times `a` = `a²` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>
*   `a` times `b` = `ab` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>
*   `b` times `a` = `ba` (or `ab`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>
*   `b` times `b` = `b²` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>

Combining these terms, we get:
`a² + ab + ab + b²` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>
Which simplifies to:
`a² + 2ab + b²` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>

This [[stepbystep_process_of_expanding_binomials | step-by-step process of expanding binomials]] shows that the middle term `2ab` is crucial and often overlooked in the common misconception.

## The Challenge of Higher Powers
While `(a + b)²` is manageable, expanding binomials to higher powers, such as `(a + b)³` or `(a + b)⁴`, becomes significantly more complex and time-consuming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Manually expanding `(a + b)³` involves multiplying `(a² + 2ab + b²)` by `(a + b)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, leading to multiple terms that need to be combined: `a³ + 3a²b + 3ab² + b³` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

For even higher powers like the 10th or 20th, manual expansion would be "incredibly, incredibly painful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. This inherent difficulty in manual expansion is precisely why systematic methods, like the [[introduction_to_the_binomial_theorem | Binomial Theorem]], are essential to avoid errors and simplify the process.

The [[introduction_to_the_binomial_theorem | Binomial Theorem]] provides a formula to expand `(a + b)ⁿ` as the sum of terms involving [[introduction_to_binomial_coefficients_and_combinatorics | binomial coefficients]] (n choose k), powers of `a`, and powers of `b` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. This theorem streamlines the expansion and helps avoid the manual pitfalls and misconceptions associated with calculating [[introduction_to_binomials_and_calculating_powers | higher powers of binomials]].

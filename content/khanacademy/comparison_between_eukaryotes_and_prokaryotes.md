Cells are defined as small compartments separated from the outside world by a [[cellular_membrane_and_its_significance | cellular membrane]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, which all cells possess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Fundamentally, all cells also contain [[dna_in_cells_and_the_role_of_nucleus | DNA]], which largely defines a living organism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

A major classification of cells in the living world is based on the presence or absence of a membrane surrounding the [[dna_in_cells_and_the_role_of_nucleus | DNA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Eukaryotes

Eukaryotic cells are characterized by having a nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. A nucleus is a membrane that encloses the [[dna_in_cells_and_the_role_of_nucleus | DNA]], separating it from the rest of the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

Key characteristics and components of eukaryotic cells include:
*   **Nucleus**: Contains the [[dna_in_cells_and_the_role_of_nucleus | DNA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   **Nucleolus**: A densely packed region within the nucleus where ribosomal RNA and components of [[structure_and_function_of_ribosomes | ribosomes]] are produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, though it is not a membrane-bound organelle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **Complexity and Size**: Eukaryotes generally tend to be larger and more complex than prokaryotes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   **Examples**: Plants, animals (including humans), and fungi are examples of eukaryotes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Cytosol**: The fluid inside the cell where free proteins float <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   **Ribosomes**: Found freely floating in the cytosol or attached to membrane structures like the endoplasmic reticulum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. They are the sites where mRNA is translated into proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
*   **Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)**: A system of interconnected membrane tunnels.
    *   **Rough ER**: Has [[structure_and_function_of_ribosomes | ribosomes]] attached to its surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. Proteins destined for membranes or outside the cell are produced here and pushed into the ER lumen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
    *   **Smooth ER**: Lacks [[structure_and_function_of_ribosomes | ribosomes]] and has other functions like hormone and fatty compound production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. Proteins typically travel from the rough ER through the smooth ER <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.
*   **Golgi Bodies**: A stack of folded membranes that receive proteins from the ER <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. They package and modify proteins for transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.
*   **Vesicles**: Small, membrane-bound sacs that bud off from the Golgi bodies, transporting proteins within or out of the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.
*   **Lysosomes**: Found in animal cells, these organelles contain enzymes that help dissolve and digest other things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.
*   **Vacuoles**: A general term for large membrane-bound organelles that store substances inside cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. In plants, lytic vacuoles serve a similar function to lysosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>.
*   **Mitochondria**: Organelles with inner and outer membranes where cellular energy (ATP) is produced from sugars through [[anaerobic_vs_aerobic_processes_in_cellular_respiration | cellular respiration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. [[structure_and_function_of_mitochondria | Mitochondria]] contain their own [[dna_in_cells_and_the_role_of_nucleus | DNA]] and can reproduce independently, suggesting their ancestors were once free-living prokaryotes that entered a symbiotic relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>.
*   **Chloroplasts**: Found in plant cells, these organelles are responsible for photosynthesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>. Like [[structure_and_function_of_mitochondria | mitochondria]], they have their own [[dna_in_cells_and_the_role_of_nucleus | DNA]] and [[structure_and_function_of_ribosomes | ribosomes]], implying a similar evolutionary history of symbiosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.
*   **Cell Wall**: In non-animal cells (like plants, where it's made of cellulose), this outer layer provides rigidity and form to the [[cellular_membrane_and_its_significance | cellular membrane]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>.
*   **Microfilaments/Actin Filaments**: These small pipes provide the cell's three-dimensional structure and aid in movement within the cell or of the cell itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.
*   **Centrioles**: Involved in cell division (as seen in [[overview_of_mitosis_and_meiosis | mitosis]] and [[differences_between_mitosis_and_meiosis | meiosis]]), centrioles are located outside the nucleus and coordinate microtubules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>. Two centrioles form a centrosome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>.

## Prokaryotes

Prokaryotic cells do not have a nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Their [[dna_in_cells_and_the_role_of_nucleus | DNA]] is not enclosed within a membrane.

Key characteristics and examples of prokaryotic cells include:
*   **No Nucleus**: This is their defining characteristic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   **Examples**: The two main groups of prokaryotes are bacteria and Archaea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Archaea were initially thought to be bacteria but are now recognized as a distinct group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Evolutionary Relationship**: Evolutionarily, cells are better classified into three separate groups: Eukaryotes, Bacteria, and Archaea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Bacteria and Archaea both lack nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

In summary, the fundamental distinction lies in the presence of a membrane-bound nucleus to house the [[dna_in_cells_and_the_role_of_nucleus | DNA]], leading to differences in overall cellular complexity and the presence of various membrane-bound organelles.

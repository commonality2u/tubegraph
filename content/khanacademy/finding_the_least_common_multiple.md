When [[adding fractions | adding fractions]] with different denominators, it is necessary to [[finding_a_common_denominator_for_fractions | find a common denominator]] for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This common denominator must be a number that both original denominators can divide into <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The smallest such number is known as the [[least_common_multiple | least common multiple]] (LCM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## What is the Least Common Multiple?
The [[least_common_multiple | least common multiple]] is defined as the smallest [[multiples of numbers | multiple]] that two or more numbers share in common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Method: Listing Multiples
One way to find the [[least_common_multiple | least common multiple]] is to list the [[multiples of numbers | multiples]] of one of the numbers and check if any of them are divisible by the other number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

### Example: Finding the LCM of 9 and 12
To find the [[least_common_multiple | least common multiple]] of 9 and 12, you can start listing the [[multiples of numbers | multiples]] of 9:
*   9 (not divisible by 12) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>
*   18 (not divisible by 12) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>
*   27 (not divisible by 12) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>
*   36 (is divisible by 12, as 12 multiplied by 3 equals 36) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>

In this case, 36 is the smallest number that both 9 and 12 divide into <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Therefore, 36 is the [[least_common_multiple | least common multiple]] of 9 and 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

> [!INFO] Application in Adding Fractions
> Once the [[least_common_multiple | least common multiple]] is found, it becomes the new common denominator for the fractions. The original fractions are then converted into equivalent fractions with this common denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. For example, to convert 4/9 to a fraction with a denominator of 36, both the numerator and denominator are multiplied by 4 (since 9 * 4 = 36), resulting in 16/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Similarly, 11/12 becomes 33/36 (multiplying by 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. With common denominators, the fractions can then be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

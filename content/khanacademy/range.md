In statistics, the range is a simple way to measure how spread apart a data set is, providing insight into its [[measures_of_dispersion | dispersion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. It is considered the most straightforward method for understanding the spread between the largest and smallest numbers in a data set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

## Calculation of Range

To calculate the range, you subtract the smallest number in a data set from the largest number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

### Example 1
Consider a data set: -10, 0, 10, 20, 30.
*   Largest number: 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>
*   Smallest number: -10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>
*   Range: 30 - (-10) = 40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>

This indicates a difference of 40 between the highest and lowest values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

### Example 2
Consider another data set: 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
*   Largest number: 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>
*   Smallest number: 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>
*   Range: 12 - 8 = 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>

In this case, the range is 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

Both example data sets have the same arithmetic [[mean_median_and_mode | mean]] of 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. However, comparing their ranges (40 versus 4) clearly shows that the first data set is more disperse than the second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

## Limitations

While useful for a quick assessment of spread, the range does not always provide the complete picture of a data set's distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Two data sets could have the exact same range but vastly different distributions of numbers, depending on how the data points are clustered or spread within that range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Other [[measures_of_dispersion | measures of dispersion]], like [[variance_and_standard_deviation | variance and standard deviation]], are often used to provide a more detailed understanding of data spread.

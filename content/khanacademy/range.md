Range is a straightforward method for measuring the spread or dispersion of a data set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. While not used as frequently as other measures like [[variance | variance]] or [[standard_deviation | standard deviation]], it offers a simple way to grasp the overall spread of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

## Definition

Range is defined as the difference between the largest and the smallest number within a data set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

## Calculation

To calculate the range, you take the largest number in the data set and subtract the smallest number from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## Examples

Consider two data sets:

*   **Data Set 1:** -10, 0, 10, 20, 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>
    *   Largest number: 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>
    *   Smallest number: -10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>
    *   Range = 30 - (-10) = 40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>

*   **Data Set 2:** 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>
    *   Largest number: 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>
    *   Smallest number: 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>
    *   Range = 12 - 8 = 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>

In these examples, Data Set 1 has a much larger range (40) compared to Data Set 2 (4), indicating that Data Set 1 is more dispersed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

## Limitations

While simple, the range doesn't always provide a complete picture of data distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Two data sets can have the same range but still have very different distributions based on how the numbers are clustered within that range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> Range is one of several [[measures_of_dispersion | measures of dispersion]] used to understand how spread out data is, complementing measures of central tendency like the arithmetic mean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

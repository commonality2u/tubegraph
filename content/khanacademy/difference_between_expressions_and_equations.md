When dealing with basic arithmetic, concrete numbers are used, such as 23 + 5, where the exact numbers are known and can be calculated, for example, 28 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Introduction to Variables
As one enters the algebraic world, the concept of [[role_of_variables_in_expressions | variables]] is introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Variables are values in expressions that have the ability to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

For instance, in the [[understanding_arithmetic_and_expressions | expression]] "x + 5", the value of this [[understanding_arithmetic_and_expressions | expression]] depends on the value assigned to `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   If `x` equals 1, then x + 5 evaluates to 1 + 5 = 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   If `x` equals -7, then x + 5 evaluates to -7 + 5 = -2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

The value of a variable can change depending on the context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This concept is applicable within an [[understanding_arithmetic_and_expressions | expression]] or an [[visualizing_and_understanding_equations | equation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Expressions
An [[understanding_arithmetic_and_expressions | expression]] is fundamentally a statement of value or a specific quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The value of an [[understanding_arithmetic_and_expressions | expression]] changes based on the value of its [[role_of_variables_in_expressions | variables]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

Examples of expressions include:
*   `x + 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>
*   `y + z` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>
    *   If `y = 1` and `z = 2`, then `y + z` is `1 + 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
    *   If `y = 0` and `z = -1`, then `y + z` is `0 + (-1)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

Expressions can be evaluated to a specific value once the values of their [[role_of_variables_in_expressions | variables]] are known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Equations
An [[visualizing_and_understanding_equations | equation]] is formed by setting two [[understanding_arithmetic_and_expressions | expressions]] equal to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. The term "equation" comes from the act of "equating" two things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

Example: `x + 3 = 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>
In an [[visualizing_and_understanding_equations | equation]] with a single unknown [[role_of_variables_in_expressions | variable]], such as `x + 3 = 1`, the value of `x` can be determined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. In this case, `x` must be -2, because -2 + 3 = 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This demonstrates how an [[visualizing_and_understanding_equations | equation]] constrains the possible values a [[role_of_variables_in_expressions | variable]] can take <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

However, an [[visualizing_and_understanding_equations | equation]] does not always constrain the [[role_of_variables_in_expressions | variables]] to a single value. For example, `x + y + z = 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. This [[visualizing_and_understanding_equations | equation]] sets one [[understanding_arithmetic_and_expressions | expression]] (`x + y + z`) equal to another [[understanding_arithmetic_and_expressions | expression]] (the number 5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. While there are constraints, the specific value of `x` (or `y`, or `z`) depends on the values of the other [[role_of_variables_in_expressions | variables]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

Example: If `y = 3` and `z = 2` in the [[visualizing_and_understanding_equations | equation]] `x + y + z = 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
The left-hand [[understanding_arithmetic_and_expressions | expression]] becomes `x + 3 + 2`, which simplifies to `x + 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
The [[visualizing_and_understanding_equations | equation]] then becomes `x + 5 = 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
In this scenario, `x` must be 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

## Key Distinction
The core distinction is that an [[understanding_arithmetic_and_expressions | expression]] is a statement of value, while an [[visualizing_and_understanding_equations | equation]] equates two expressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. The value a [[role_of_variables_in_expressions | variable]] takes on is dependent on the specific context of the problem, whether it's within an [[understanding_arithmetic_and_expressions | expression]] or an [[visualizing_and_understanding_equations | equation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

## Evaluating Expressions with Variables
To further illustrate, consider evaluating [[understanding_arithmetic_and_expressions | expressions]] when [[role_of_variables_in_expressions | variables]] are assigned different values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### Example 1: `x` to the `y` power (`x^y`)
*   If `x = 5` and `y = 2`, the [[understanding_arithmetic_and_expressions | expression]] `x^y` evaluates to `5^2 = 25` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   If `x = -2` and `y = 3`, the [[understanding_arithmetic_and_expressions | expression]] `x^y` evaluates to `(-2)^3 = (-2) * (-2) * (-2) = -8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

### Example 2: Square root of `x + y`, minus `x` (`√(x + y) - x`)
*   If `x = 1` and `y = 8`, the [[understanding_arithmetic_and_expressions | expression]] evaluates as follows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>:
    *   Substitute `x` with 1 and `y` with 8: `√(1 + 8) - 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
    *   Calculate inside the square root: `√(9) - 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
    *   Take the principal root: `3 - 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
    *   Final result: `2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

In basic arithmetic, you typically work with concrete numbers, such as `23 + 5` or `2 * 7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. You know the exact values you are dealing with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. However, when you enter the world of algebra, you begin to encounter variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Understanding Variables

Variables are values within expressions that can change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. For example, in the expression `x + 5`, the value of this expression depends on the value of `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

*   If `x` is `1`, then `x + 5` evaluates to `1 + 5 = 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   If `x` is `-7`, then `x + 5` evaluates to `-7 + 5 = -2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

Here, `x` is a variable because its value can change depending on the context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## [[understanding_algebraic_expressions | Understanding Algebraic Expressions]]

An expression is a statement of value or quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The value of an expression changes depending on the values of the variables within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

Examples of expressions:
*   `x + 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>
*   `y + z` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>: This expression can be [[evaluating_expressions_with_different_variable_values | evaluated]] for different values of `y` and `z` (e.g., if `y=1` and `z=2`, it's `1+2=3`; if `y=0` and `z=-1`, it's `0+(-1)=-1`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

## [[understanding_relationships_and_equations_in_algebra | Understanding Algebraic Equations]]

An equation is formed when you set two expressions equal to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. The term "equation" comes from "equating" two things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

Examples of equations:
*   `x + 3 = 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>: In this case, with one equation and one unknown, you can determine what `x` must be (`x = -2`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. An equation like this constrains the value that the variable can take on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   `x + y + z = 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>: Here, you have an expression (`x + y + z`) set equal to another expression (`5`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. This equation also introduces constraints. For instance, if `y = 3` and `z = 2`, the equation becomes `x + 3 + 2 = 5`, which simplifies to `x + 5 = 5`, meaning `x` must be `0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Such equations can be part of [[understanding_systems_of_equations | systems of equations]] where multiple variables interact.

## Key Distinction

<div class="callout">
    **Expression:** A statement of value or quantity, whose value can change depending on its variables (e.g., `x + 5`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
    **Equation:** Sets two expressions equal to each other, often constraining the possible values of the variables (e.g., `x + 3 = 1`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
</div>

The important takeaway is that a variable's value can differ based on the problem's context, whether it's in an expression or an equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

## [[evaluating_expressions_with_different_variable_values | Evaluating Expressions with Different Variable Values]]

To further illustrate how variables take on different values, consider these examples:

### Example 1: `x^y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>
*   If `x = 5` and `y = 2`, the expression `x^y` evaluates to `5^2 = 25` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   If `x = -2` and `y = 3`, the expression `x^y` evaluates to `(-2)^3 = -2 * -2 * -2 = -8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

### Example 2: `sqrt(x + y) - x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>
*   If `x = 1` and `y = 8`, you substitute these values into the expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>:
    *   `sqrt(1 + 8) - 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>
    *   `sqrt(9) - 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>
    *   `3 - 1 = 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>

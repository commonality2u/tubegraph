When transitioning from basic arithmetic, where concrete numbers like "23 plus 5" or "2 times 7" are used, into the algebraic world, concepts like variables, expressions, and equations become fundamental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Variables

[[understanding_algebraic_expressions | Variables]] are values within [[mathematical_expressions | expressions]] that can change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The value a variable takes on depends on the context of the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

For instance, in the expression `x + 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>:
*   If `x` is 1, the expression evaluates to `1 + 5 = 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   If `x` is -7, the expression evaluates to `-7 + 5 = -2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Expressions

An [[expressions_and_their_evaluation | expression]] is fundamentally a statement of value or a specific type of quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The value of an expression changes based on the values assigned to its variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

Examples of expressions:
*   `x + 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>
*   `y + z` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>: If `y` is 1 and `z` is 2, it's `1 + 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. If `y` is 0 and `z` is -1, it's `0 + (-1)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   `x^y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>:
    *   If `x = 5` and `y = 2`, it evaluates to `5^2 = 25` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
    *   If `x = -2` and `y = 3`, it evaluates to `(-2)^3 = -8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   `√(x + y) - x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>: If `x = 1` and `y = 8`, it evaluates to `√(1 + 8) - 1 = √9 - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

## Equations

An [[understanding_mathematical_equations | equation]] involves setting two [[mathematical_expressions | expressions]] equal to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. The term "equation" itself implies "equating two things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

Examples of equations:
*   `x + 3 = 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>: In this case, with one equation and one unknown, the value of `x` is constrained to be -2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   `x + y + z = 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>: Here, the left-hand side is an expression equal to the right-hand side expression (the number 5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are constrained by this equation. If `y = 3` and `z = 2`, the equation becomes `x + 3 + 2 = 5`, which simplifies to `x + 5 = 5`. This further constrains `x` to be 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

## Key Distinction

The crucial [[difference_between_regular_and_differential_equations | difference between an expression and an equation]] lies in their purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>:

*   **[[mathematical_expressions | Expressions]]** are statements that represent a value or quantity, and their value can vary depending on the variables' context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **[[definition_and_examples_of_equations | Equations]]** set two expressions equal to each other, often constraining the possible values of the variables involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

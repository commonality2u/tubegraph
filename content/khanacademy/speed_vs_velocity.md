This article explores the [[difference_between_vectors_and_scalars | difference between vectors and scalars]] to clarify the concepts of speed and velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. These are fundamental ideas in physics, often introduced using [[basic_concepts_in_onedimensional_motion | examples of motion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Vectors and Scalars

A **vector** is a quantity that possesses both a magnitude (size) and a direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. A **scalar**, on the other hand, only has a magnitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

To illustrate these concepts, consider moving a brick 5 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. If only "5 meters" is stated, this measurement is a scalar quantity because it only indicates the size of the movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This scalar quantity, when referring to how much something has changed its position without direction, is called [[distance_vs_displacement | distance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

However, if the movement is described as "5 meters to the right," it becomes a vector quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Here, "5 meters" is the magnitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, and "to the right" is the direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. This vector version of distance, which includes direction, is known as [[distance_vs_displacement | displacement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

## Speed

Speed is a scalar quantity that measures how fast something is moving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. It is calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

For example, if a brick moves 5 meters in 2 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>:
*   The duration (time) is 2 seconds, which is typically considered a scalar quantity in simple physics as time generally moves in one direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   The calculation is 5 meters / 2 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   This results in 2.5 meters per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

This value, 2.5 meters per second, is a scalar quantity because it only tells you the magnitude of how fast the brick moved, without specifying any direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## Velocity

Velocity is a vector quantity that describes both the speed of an object and its direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

Using the same example of the brick moving 5 meters to the right in 2 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>:
*   The calculation is 5 meters to the right / 2 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
*   This yields 2.5 meters per second to the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

This measurement is a vector quantity because it specifies both the magnitude (2.5 meters per second) and the direction (to the right) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

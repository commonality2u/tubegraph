Mitochondria are often referred to as the "power centers of the cell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. They play a crucial role in [[overview_of_cellular_respiration | cellular respiration]], particularly in the later stages that generate the bulk of the cell's [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

## Structural Components

A mitochondrion possesses distinct membranes and compartments:
*   **Outer Membrane** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>: The outermost boundary of the mitochondrion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   **Inner Membrane** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>: Located inside the outer [[cellular_membrane_and_its_significance | membrane]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. This [[cellular_membrane_and_its_significance | membrane]] is convoluted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
    *   **Crista (singular) / Cristae (plural)**: The folds of the inner [[cellular_membrane_and_its_significance | membrane]] are called cristae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, with a single fold being a crista <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   **Compartments**: The two membranes divide the mitochondrion into two main compartments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>:
    *   **Outer Compartment**: The space between the outer and inner membranes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
    *   **Matrix**: The inner compartment located within the inner [[cellular_membrane_and_its_significance | membrane]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

## Role in Cellular Respiration

While [[glycolysis_and_its_role_in_cellular_respiration | glycolysis]] occurs in the cytoplasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, the subsequent stages of [[overview_of_cellular_respiration | cellular respiration]] take place within the mitochondria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### Pyruvate Oxidation
The two pyruvate molecules, produced from a single glucose molecule during [[glycolysis_and_its_role_in_cellular_respiration | glycolysis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, undergo a preparatory step called pyruvate oxidation before entering the Krebs cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. This process occurs for each pyruvate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>:
*   A carbon is cleaved off the 3-carbon pyruvate, forming a 2-carbon compound called acetyl-CoA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   NAD+ is reduced to NADH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
For every molecule of glucose, two NADHs are produced during pyruvate oxidation (one for each pyruvate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

### The Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle)
The Krebs cycle, also known as the citric acid cycle, takes place within the inner space (matrix) of the mitochondria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. It is a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **Entry Point**: Acetyl-CoA (2-carbon) merges with oxaloacetic acid (4-carbon) to form citrate or citric acid (6-carbon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Oxidation and Regeneration**: The citric acid is then oxidized over several steps, with carbons cleaved off to regenerate oxaloacetic acid, thus completing the cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   **Outputs per turn (per pyruvate)**:
    *   3 NADHs are reduced from NAD+ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.
    *   1 [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]] is produced (via GTP in some diagrams) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
    *   1 FADH2 is produced from FAD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
*   **Carbon Dioxide Production**: Carbons cleaved during pyruvate oxidation and the Krebs cycle are released as CO2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. For every glucose molecule, six carbon dioxide molecules are eventually produced and exhaled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

### Electron Transport Chain (ETC)
The NADHs and FADH2s generated in [[glycolysis_and_its_role_in_cellular_respiration | glycolysis]], pyruvate oxidation, and the Krebs cycle are crucial inputs for the electron transport chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. This is where the majority of [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]] is produced:
*   Each NADH yields approximately 3 [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATPs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.
*   Each FADH2 yields approximately 2 [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATPs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

In summary, for every molecule of glucose, [[overview_of_cellular_respiration | cellular respiration]] in a super-efficient cell theoretically yields 38 [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATPs]]:
*   4 [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATPs]] directly produced (2 from [[glycolysis_and_its_role_in_cellular_respiration | glycolysis]] and 2 from the Krebs cycle) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.
*   30 [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATPs]] from 10 NADHs in the ETC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.
*   4 [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATPs]] from 2 FADH2s in the ETC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.

### Metabolic Intermediary
The Krebs cycle is a central entry point for the catabolism of other macromolecules besides carbohydrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. Acetyl-CoA serves as a general catabolic intermediary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>:
*   Proteins can be broken down into amino acids, which can then be converted into acetyl-CoA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.
*   Fats can be turned into glucose, which can then enter the [[overview_of_cellular_respiration | cellular respiration]] pathway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.
This allows the body to generate [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]] from various fuel sources like carbohydrates, proteins, or fats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.

In [[hypothesis_testing]], researchers set up two contrasting statements, known as the null and alternative hypotheses, to evaluate the effect of a variable or intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This framework helps determine if observed data is statistically significant enough to conclude an effect exists.

## The Null Hypothesis (H₀)

The null hypothesis, often referred to as the "status quo," assumes that whatever is being researched has no effect or that there is no change or difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

In the context of a neurologist testing a drug on rat response time:
*   **Definition** The null hypothesis states that the drug has no effect on response time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   **Implication** This means the mean response time for rats given the drug would still be 1.2 seconds, which is the known mean response time for rats not injected with the drug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## The Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)

The alternative hypothesis is the contrasting statement to the null hypothesis. It proposes that there *is* an effect, a change, or a difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

In the neurologist's experiment:
*   **Definition** The alternative hypothesis states that the drug *does* have an effect on response time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   **Implication** This means the mean response time when the drug is given would not equal 1.2 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Deciding Between Hypotheses

The decision to accept the alternative hypothesis or default to the null hypothesis depends on the convincingness of the data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. The standard approach in science involves the following steps:

1.  **Assume the Null Hypothesis is True** The process begins by assuming that the null hypothesis is true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
2.  **Calculate Probability of Observed Results** Researchers then determine the probability of obtaining the observed sample results (or more extreme results) *if* the null hypothesis were true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
3.  **P-value** This calculated probability is called the P-value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. It represents the probability of observing data as extreme as, or more extreme than, what was observed, assuming the null hypothesis is correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
    *   For the neurologist's experiment, the P-value was calculated to be 0.003 (0.3%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. This means there's a 0.3% chance of getting such an extreme sample mean (1.05 seconds) if the drug had no effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

### Rejecting the Null Hypothesis

If the calculated P-value is very small, it suggests that the observed results are unlikely to have occurred by chance if the null hypothesis were true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. In such cases, the null hypothesis is often [[rejecting_the_null_hypothesis | rejected]] in favor of the alternative hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

*   **Threshold** Most researchers use a P-value threshold, commonly 5% (0.05), to decide whether to [[rejecting_the_null_hypothesis | reject the null hypothesis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. If the P-value is less than 5% (a less than 1 in 20 chance), it is considered strong evidence against the null hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   **Conclusion** In the neurologist's study, with a P-value of 0.003, the probability of the results occurring by chance if the null hypothesis were true is very low (less than 1 in 300) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. This strongly indicates that the null hypothesis is incorrect and the drug has a definite effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

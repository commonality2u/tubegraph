Khan Academy, initially known for its collection of educational videos, has evolved to incorporate data-driven strategies aimed at enhancing student learning and transforming the classroom experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. With over 2,200 videos covering topics from basic arithmetic to vector calculus, the platform serves millions of students monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Evolution to Mastery-Based Learning
The concept of data-driven education began with Salman Khan's remote tutoring of his cousins, for whom he started creating YouTube videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. This allowed his cousins to [[personalized_and_selfpaced_learning | pause and repeat]] lessons without feeling embarrassed or wasting his time, fostering a sense of intimacy in their learning environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

Feedback from users, including a 12-year-old with autism who excelled in math using the videos, highlighted the profound impact of this approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Teachers also began adopting the videos to [[flipping_the_classroom_model | flip the classroom model]], assigning lectures as homework and dedicating class time to practice and interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. This use of [[online_learning_and_technology_in_education | technology]] allowed teachers to "humanize the classroom" by removing the "one size fits all" lecture and enabling more personalized student engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

The core of Khan Academy's data-driven model is its practice exercises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. The system generates as many questions as needed until a student achieves "10 in a row" mastery on a concept before moving on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. This contrasts sharply with traditional classroom assessments that penalize experimentation and failure, often leading to "Swiss cheese gaps" in foundational knowledge as students progress without full mastery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. The platform encourages experimentation and failure, but expects mastery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

All learning modules fit into a "knowledge map," starting with basic concepts like single-digit addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. Mastery of one node unlocks more advanced modules, forming a scaffolded learning path that can eventually teach subjects from logic to computer programming and genetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

## Data in Action: The Los Altos Pilot
In the Los Altos school district, two fifth-grade and two seventh-grade classes completely replaced their traditional math curriculum with Khan Academy, using the software for roughly half of their math class time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. This approach frees up teacher time from lecturing and grading, allowing for simulations, games, and project-based learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

### Teacher Dashboard
Teachers in Los Altos use a live dashboard that displays student progress at a glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>:
*   Each row represents a student, and each column a concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.
*   Green indicates proficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
*   Blue means the student is actively working on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.
*   Red signifies a student is stuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

This data allows teachers to intervene specifically with "red kids" or facilitate peer tutoring by connecting proficient ("green") students with those who are struggling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

### Granular Student Data
The system provides granular data to help teachers diagnose student issues and make interactions productive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>:
*   Time spent daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.
*   Videos watched and where they were paused or stopped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.
*   Exercises used and focus areas (shown by outer and inner circles on a diagram) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
*   Exact problems a student got right (blue) or wrong (red), showing their learning progression and speed improvement over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

This data reveals that students who might initially appear "slow" in a traditional snapshot assessment often race ahead once they master a concept at their own [[personalized_and_selfpaced_learning | pace]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. This observation challenges conventional labels like "gifted" or "slow," suggesting they might be "due to a coincidence of time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

## Redefining Teacher-Student Interaction
Data-driven teaching shifts the focus from student-to-teacher ratios to the "student to valuable human time with the teacher" ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. Instead of spending most of their time lecturing and grading, teachers can now dedicate 100% of their time to working directly with students, humanizing the classroom by a factor of five or ten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

This approach benefits not only traditional students but also adult learners embarrassed to review foundational concepts and those in challenging circumstances, like a "street kid in Calcutta" who can now learn without embarrassment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.

## Global Classroom and Motivation
The system envisions a "global one world classroom" where students can tutor peers beyond their immediate classroom, facilitating cross-cultural learning interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.

To further boost motivation, Khan Academy incorporates game mechanics like badges, energy points, and leaderboards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. The specific wording of badging or points awarded can significantly influence the learning direction of tens of thousands of students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

Teacher feedback is crucial for developing these data tools; many dashboard features, like the "focus graph" to track student topic engagement, were directly requested by teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>. The continuous tracking of student data across different teachers and over summers provides valuable continuity at the district level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. Parents and other volunteers can also use the coach dashboards to mentor students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>.

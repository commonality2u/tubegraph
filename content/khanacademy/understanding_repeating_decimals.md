When [[converting_fractions_to_decimals | converting fractions to decimals]], some fractions result in decimals where a pattern of digits repeats indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47">[01:47]</a>. These are known as repeating decimals.

## Identifying Repeating Decimals

The process of [[converting_fractions_to_decimals | converting a fraction to a decimal]] involves dividing the numerator by the denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. If, during this long division, the remainder starts repeating, the decimal representation will also repeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42">[01:42]</a>.

### Examples

*   **1/3 as a decimal:**
    When dividing 1 by 3, the calculation shows a repeating pattern of 3s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45">[01:45]</a>.
    ```
    0.333...
    3 | 1.000
      - 9
      ---
        10
      -  9
      ----
         10
      -   9
      -----
          1
    ```
    Thus, 1/3 is equal to 0.33333... <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17">[02:17]</a>.

*   **17/9 as a decimal:**
    For an improper fraction like 17/9, the numerator is larger than the denominator, meaning the decimal will be greater than 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50">[02:50]</a>.
    ```
    1.888...
    9 | 17.000
      - 9
      ---
        80
      - 72
      ----
         80
      -  72
      -----
          8
    ```
    In this case, 17/9 is equal to 1.88..., where the 8 repeats indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46">[03:46]</a>.

## Notation for Repeating Decimals

Since it's impossible to write an infinite number of repeating digits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48">[01:48]</a>, a special notation is used:
*   A line placed on top of the repeating digits indicates that this number pattern repeats indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09">[02:09]</a>.
*   For example, 0.333... can be written as 0.33 repeating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54">[01:54]</a> or 0.3 repeating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03">[02:03]</a>. Similarly, 1.888... is written as 1.88 repeating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46">[03:46]</a>.

## Approximating Repeating Decimals

While the repeating decimal notation provides the exact answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09">[04:09]</a>, for practical purposes, repeating decimals can be [[approximating_decimals_during_conversion | approximated]] by rounding to a specific decimal place, such as the hundredths or thousandths place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27">[06:27]</a>. For example, 1.88 repeating could be roughly rounded to 1.89 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02">[04:02]</a>.

### Precision in Division
When performing division to find a decimal, it's often necessary to add a decimal point and trailing zeros to the numerator to maintain [[importance_of_decimal_points_in_precision | precision]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This does not change the value of the original number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This method is applicable even when dividing a larger number into a smaller number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54">[04:54]</a>.

This article introduces fundamental concepts of addition, demonstrating various techniques to solve basic addition problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Using Objects for Addition

One way to understand addition is by using objects to visualize the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

*   **Example 1: 1 + 1**
    If you have one avocado and someone gives you another avocado, you now have two avocados in total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Therefore, 1 plus 1 equals 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   **Example 2: 3 + 4**
    Starting with three avocados and adding four more results in a total of seven avocados <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Thus, 3 plus 4 equals 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. (An avocado is described as a very delicious, fatty fruit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.)

## Using a Number Line for Addition

The [[number_line_for_addition | number line]] is another effective method for understanding and solving addition problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. To use it, you start at the first number in the problem and move to the right (or "up") along the number line by the amount of the second number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

### Number Line Examples

*   **3 + 4**
    Starting at 3 on the number line and moving 4 spaces to the right leads to 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
    ```
    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
                   ^-----^
                   start at 3, move 4 steps
    ```
*   **8 + 1**
    Beginning at 8 and moving 1 space to the right on the number line results in 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Adding 1 to any number just means finding the "next number" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **5 + 6**
    Starting at 5 and moving 6 spaces to the right on the number line ends at 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   **8 + 7**
    From 8, moving 7 spaces to the right on the number line leads to 15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

## Commutative Property of Addition

A key principle in addition is that the order of the numbers does not affect the sum. This is known as the [[commutative_property_of_addition | commutative property of addition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

*   **Example: 5 + 6 vs. 6 + 5**
    As shown with the number line, both 5 plus 6 and 6 plus 5 yield the same answer, 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. If you have 5 avocados and get 6 more, you have 11. If you have 6 avocados and get 5 more, you still have 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

## Practice and Mastery

[[practice_techniques_for_addition | Practicing basic addition]] frequently using methods like drawing circles (or objects) or using a [[number_line_for_addition | number line]] helps in memorizing addition facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. With consistent practice, these problems will eventually become second nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

To divide into [[division_with_larger_numbers | larger numbers]], a foundational understanding of [[importance_of_multiplication_tables_in_division | multiplication tables]] is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It is recommended to know your [[importance_of_multiplication_tables_in_division | multiplication tables]] from 1x1 up to at least 10x10, which equals 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. While some learned up to 12x12 in school, 10x10 is generally sufficient as a starting point for [[stepbystep_process_for_basic_division_problems | division problems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Reliance on Multiplication Tables

Many basic division problems can be solved quickly by thinking of the inverse operation, [[understanding_basic_multiplication | multiplication]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

For example:
*   To divide 25 by 5, you think: "5 times what is 25?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
    *   Knowing your 5-[[importance_of_multiplication_tables_in_division | multiplication tables]], you know 5 times 5 equals 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
    *   Thus, 5 goes into 25 five times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. The 5 is written in the ones place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   For 49 divided by 7, you ask: "7 times what is 49?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
    *   The answer is 7, as 7 times 7 equals 49 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   For 54 divided by 9, you consider: "9 times what is 54?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
    *   If you know 9 times 5 is 45, then adding 9 more (9 times 6) gives 54 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
    *   Therefore, 9 goes into 54 six times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## Division with Remainders

Not all [[stepbystep_process_for_basic_division_problems | division problems]] result in a whole number without anything left over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

Consider dividing 23 by 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   List the multiples of 3: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   There is no multiple of 3 that is exactly 23 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   Find the largest multiple of 3 that is less than or equal to 23, which is 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
*   Since 3 times 7 equals 21, 3 goes into 23 seven times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   Calculate the [[handling_division_with_remainders | remainder]]: 23 minus 21 is 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
*   So, 23 divided by 3 is 7 [[handling_division_with_remainders | remainder]] 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This means it goes in cleanly 7 times, with 2 left over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

## Long Division Process for Larger Numbers

When dividing into [[division_with_larger_numbers | larger numbers]] that exceed typical multiplication tables, a systematic approach is used.

### Example 1: 344 divided by 4

To divide 344 by 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>:

1.  **Divide the first digit**: Start by asking how many times 4 goes into the first digit, 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Since 4 goes into 3 zero times, move to the next set of digits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
2.  **Divide the first two digits**: Consider how many times 4 goes into 34 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
    *   Recall 4 times 8 equals 32, and 4 times 9 equals 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
    *   Since 36 is greater than 34, 4 goes into 34 eight times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
    *   Write the '8' in the tens place above the 4 in 344 (representing 80) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
3.  **Multiply and Subtract**: Multiply the 8 by 4 to get 32 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Subtract 32 from 34, leaving 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. This 2 represents 20 because of its place value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
4.  **Bring down the next digit**: Bring down the next digit from 344, which is 4, next to the 2, forming 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
5.  **Repeat the process**: Now, ask how many times 4 goes into 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
    *   Knowing 4 times 6 equals 24, 4 goes into 24 six times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
    *   Write the '6' in the ones place above the 4 in 344 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
6.  **Multiply and Subtract (final)**: Multiply 6 by 4 to get 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Subtract 24 from 24, resulting in 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

Since the remainder is 0, 4 goes into 344 exactly 86 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

### Example 2: 91 divided by 7

To divide 91 by 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>:

1.  **Divide the first digit**: 7 goes into 9 one time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. Write '1' above the 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
2.  **Multiply and Subtract**: 1 times 7 is 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Subtract 7 from 9, leaving 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
3.  **Bring down**: Bring down the 1, making 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
4.  **Repeat**: How many times does 7 go into 21? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>
    *   7 times 3 is 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. So, 7 goes into 21 three times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
    *   Write '3' above the 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
5.  **Multiply and Subtract (final)**: 3 times 7 is 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. Subtract 21 from 21, resulting in 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

Thus, 91 divided by 7 is 13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

### Example 3: 608 divided by 8

To divide 608 by 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>:

1.  **Divide the first digit**: 8 goes into 6 zero times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
2.  **Divide the first two digits**: Consider how many times 8 goes into 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
    *   8 times 7 is 56, and 8 times 8 is 64 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
    *   Since 64 is too large, 8 goes into 60 seven times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
    *   Write '7' above the 0 in 608 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
3.  **Multiply and Subtract**: 7 times 8 is 56 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. Subtract 56 from 60, leaving 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
4.  **Bring down**: Bring down the 8, making 48 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
5.  **Repeat**: How many times does 8 go into 48? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>
    *   8 times 6 is exactly 48 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. So, 8 goes into 48 six times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.
    *   Write '6' above the 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
6.  **Multiply and Subtract (final)**: 6 times 8 is 48 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. Subtract 48 from 48, resulting in 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

Thus, 608 divided by 8 is 76 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

By understanding the process and having [[importance_of_multiplication_tables_in_division | multiplication tables]] memorized, you can effectively tackle these [[stepbystep_process_for_basic_division_problems | larger division problems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

[[introduction_to_geometry | Geometry]] is a subject whose name originates from "earth measurement" ("geo" referring to earth, "metry" to measurement) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. It broadly encompasses the study and understanding of how shapes, space, and other visual mathematical concepts relate to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Points

A **point** is a fundamental concept in geometry, defined as a specific position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   **Properties**
    *   A point is a fixed position; if one moves in any direction from a point, they are no longer at that point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
    *   Points have zero dimensions, meaning one cannot move up, down, left, right, in, or out while remaining on the point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   **Labeling**
    *   Points are typically labeled with capital letters (e.g., Point A, Point B, Point C, Point D) to differentiate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Line Segments

A **line segment** consists of all points that connect two specific points along a straight path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. In everyday language, it might be called a "line," but in mathematical terms, a line segment is distinct from a line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   **Endpoints**
    *   The two specific points that define a line segment are called its **endpoints** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Properties**
    *   A line segment is a one-dimensional object, meaning one can only move back and forth along its length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.
    *   A geometrically pure line segment has length but no width <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
    *   Unlike a line, a line segment has a finite length and clear endpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
*   **Labeling**
    *   To label a line segment, its endpoints are written with a line drawn above them (e.g., $\overline{AB}$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. The order of the letters does not matter (e.g., $\overline{CD}$ is the same as $\overline{DC}$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   **Length**
    *   To refer to the length or distance of a line segment, the line over the letters is omitted. For example, $AB = 5$ units means the length of line segment AB is 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

## Rays

A **ray** is a one-dimensional figure that starts at a specific point (called its **vertex**) and extends infinitely in one direction through another point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   **Labeling**
    *   A ray is labeled by its vertex and another point it passes through, with an arrow above them indicating the direction of infinite extension (e.g., $\overrightarrow{AD}$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. The order of the letters is important (e.g., $\overrightarrow{AD}$ is different from $\overrightarrow{DA}$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

## Lines

A **line** is a one-dimensional object that extends infinitely in both directions through two given points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   **Labeling**
    *   A line is specified using two points on it, with arrows on both ends of the line symbol above the letters (e.g., $\overleftrightarrow{EF}$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

## Related Concepts

*   **[[concept_of_lines_and_colinearity | Colinearity]]**
    *   Points are **colinear** if they all lie on the same straight line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
*   **Midpoint**
    *   The **midpoint** of a line segment is the point that is exactly halfway between its two endpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. If point Z is the midpoint of line segment XY, then the distance from X to Z is equal to the distance from Z to Y <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

## Dimensions in Geometry

*   **Zero Dimensions:** A point has zero dimensions, as it only specifies a position without any travel options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   **One Dimension:** Lines, line segments, and rays are one-dimensional, allowing movement in a single direction (back and forth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.
*   **Two Dimensions:** A **plane** is a two-dimensional object, allowing movement in two different directions (e.g., left/right and up/down) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. An infinite piece of paper could be considered a geometrical plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.
*   **Three Dimensions:** Three-dimensional space allows movement in three independent directions (e.g., left/right, up/down, and in/out of the screen) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. Higher dimensions can also be studied in advanced mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

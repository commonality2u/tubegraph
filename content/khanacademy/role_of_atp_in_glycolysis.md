[[overview_of_glycolysis | Glycolysis]], the initial phase of [[glycolysis_and_its_role_in_cellular_respiration | cellular respiration]], involves both the consumption and production of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. While the bulk of ATP is generated later in the [[electron transport chain | electron transport chain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, glycolysis directly contributes to ATP synthesis and provides raw materials for subsequent ATP production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. The overall purpose of [[cellular respiration | cellular respiration]] is to generate ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## [[atp_investment_and_payoff_phases_in_glycolysis | ATP Investment Phase]]

The first significant phase of [[overview_of_glycolysis | glycolysis]] is known as the **investment phase** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. In this phase, the cell actually consumes ATP to initiate the breakdown of glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Specifically, two ATP molecules are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. These ATP molecules donate phosphate groups, which are added to the glucose molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. This investment helps break the six-carbon glucose into two 3-carbon compounds, such as phosphoglyceraldehyde (PGAL) or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, each with a phosphate group attached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

## [[atp_investment_and_payoff_phases_in_glycolysis | ATP Payoff Phase]]

Following the investment phase, the two 3-carbon PGAL molecules enter the **payoff phase** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. During this phase, ATP is produced. Each PGAL molecule is converted into pyruvate, a reconfigured 3-carbon compound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. As each PGAL molecule is processed, two ATP molecules are produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Since two PGAL molecules are generated from one glucose molecule, a total of four ATPs are produced in the payoff phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

## Net ATP Production

Considering both phases for one molecule of glucose:
*   **ATP used (Investment Phase):** 2 ATPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>
*   **ATP produced (Payoff Phase):** 4 ATPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>

Therefore, the **net direct ATP production** from [[overview_of_glycolysis | glycolysis]] is **2 ATPs** (4 produced - 2 used) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

## Indirect ATP Production

In addition to direct ATP production, the payoff phase also generates two molecules of NADH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. These NADHs are crucial because they carry electrons that will later be used in the [[electron transport chain | electron transport chain]] to produce a significant amount of additional ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Each NADH molecule can potentially yield three ATPs in the electron transport chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

Summary of Glycolysis Outputs:
- 2 Net ATPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>
- 2 NADHs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>
- 2 Pyruvates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>

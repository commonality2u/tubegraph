[[Introduction to Probability | Probability]] is a fundamental concept in mathematics that measures the likelihood of an event occurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. When considering a situation where outcomes are uncertain, like picking a marble from a bag, probability helps quantify how likely a specific result is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Outcomes
In probability, an **outcome** refers to any single possible result of a trial or an [[experimentation_in_probability | experiment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. For example, if you are picking a marble from a bag containing different colored marbles, each individual marble that could be picked represents a distinct outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

Consider a bag containing:
*   3 yellow marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>
*   2 red marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   2 green marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>
*   1 blue marble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>

The possible individual outcomes of picking a marble are:
*   Yellow Marble 1
*   Yellow Marble 2
*   Yellow Marble 3
*   Red Marble 1
*   Red Marble 2
*   Green Marble 1
*   Green Marble 2
*   Blue Marble 1

In this scenario, there are 8 distinct possible [[outcomes_in_coin_flipping | outcomes]] in total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, which can also be described as 8 possible marbles to pick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Sample Space
The [[sample_space_in_probability | sample space]] is the set of all possible outcomes for a given trial or experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. It encompasses every result that could potentially occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. In the marble example, the sample space consists of all 8 marbles in the bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The *size* of the sample space refers to the total number of possible outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Events
An **event** is a specific outcome or a set of outcomes that one is interested in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. It is often described as the "constraint" or condition that outcomes must satisfy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. For instance, the event "picking a yellow marble" refers to any outcome where the marble drawn is yellow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

In our example, there are 3 yellow marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Therefore, 3 outcomes satisfy the event "picking a yellow marble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## Calculating Probability
The probability of an event occurring is calculated by dividing the number of outcomes that satisfy the event by the total number of possible outcomes (the size of the sample space) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

$$ P(\text{Event}) = \frac{\text{Number of outcomes satisfying the event}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} $$

For the example of picking a yellow marble:
*   Number of outcomes satisfying the event (picking a yellow marble) = 3 (since there are 3 yellow marbles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>
*   Total number of possible outcomes = 8 (total marbles in the bag) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>

So, the probability of picking a yellow marble is:
$$ P(\text{Yellow Marble}) = \frac{3}{8} $$

This calculation represents how likely it is for the desired event to happen compared to all other possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

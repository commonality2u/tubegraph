The immune system is broadly categorized into two main branches: the nonspecific (or [[innate_immune_system_and_first_line_barriers | innate immune system]]) and the specific (or adaptive immune system) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

### Nonspecific (Innate) Immune System
The [[innate_immune_system_and_first_line_barriers | innate immune system]] provides a rapid, general response to any perceived threat, without needing to recognize specific pathogens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. It operates based on general danger signals, such as the presence of double-stranded DNA unique to viruses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This system is widespread across many species and types of organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

It can be further subdivided into two lines of defense:

#### First Line Barriers
These are physical and chemical barriers that prevent pathogens from entering the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. They act as the initial defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Examples include:
*   Skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>
*   Stomach acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>
*   The acidity of oils on the skin's surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>

#### Second Line of Defense
Once pathogens bypass the first line of defense and enter the body, the second line of defense activates. These responses are still nonspecific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Key components include:

*   **Phagocytes**: These are cells that engulf and destroy foreign material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. They are a type of [[role_of_neutrophils_and_other_white_blood_cells | white blood cell]] (leukocyte) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Common examples include dendritic cells, macrophages, and [[role_of_neutrophils_and_other_white_blood_cells | neutrophils]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Phagocytes are largely nonspecific in their action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **[[inflammatory_response_overview | Inflammatory Response]]**: This is a complex biological response to harmful stimuli, such as pathogens, damaged cells, or irritants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Its primary goal is to bring immune cells and other protective substances to the site of infection or injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

### The [[inflammatory_response_overview | Inflammatory Response]]
The [[inflammatory_response_overview | inflammatory response]] is a crucial part of the nonspecific immune system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. It functions to direct resources and cells to the site of "action" or infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

While this article focuses on the nonspecific aspects of the immune system, the specific (adaptive) immune system, primarily involving [[specific_immune_system_and_lymphocytes | lymphocytes]], will be discussed in further detail in subsequent explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

The circle is considered a fundamental shape in our universe, appearing in phenomena such as the orbits of planets and the structure of molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Understanding the [[properties_of_a_circle | properties of the circle]] is therefore valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Defining a Circle
A circle is defined as all points that are equidistant from a central point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## The Radius

The first key measurement derived from this definition is the [[definition_and_importance_of_radius_and_diameter | radius]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. The [[definition_and_importance_of_radius_and_diameter | radius]] is the distance from the center of the circle out to any point on its edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This distance remains constant for all points on the circle's edge; for instance, if one [[definition_and_importance_of_radius_and_diameter | radius]] is 3 centimeters, then every [[definition_and_importance_of_radius_and_diameter | radius]] in that circle will be 3 centimeters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## The Diameter

Another important measurement is the [[definition_and_importance_of_radius_and_diameter | diameter]], which addresses how wide a circle is at its widest point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This "widest point" refers to a straight line segment that passes through the center of the circle and connects two points on the circle's edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. There are multiple places where this measurement can be taken, as long as it always goes through the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## The Relationship

The [[definition_and_importance_of_radius_and_diameter | diameter]] has a straightforward relationship with the [[definition_and_importance_of_radius_and_diameter | radius]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Since the widest point of the circle passes through the center, it effectively consists of two radii extending in opposite directions from the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

Therefore, the [[definition_and_importance_of_radius_and_diameter | diameter]] is equal to two times the [[definition_and_importance_of_radius_and_diameter | radius]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

$$ \text{Diameter} = 2 \times \text{Radius} $$

Alternatively, the [[definition_and_importance_of_radius_and_diameter | radius]] is half of the [[definition_and_importance_of_radius_and_diameter | diameter]]:

$$ \text{Radius} = \frac{\text{Diameter}}{2} $$

### Practical Application
For example, if a circle has a [[definition_and_importance_of_radius_and_diameter | radius]] of 3 meters, its [[definition_and_importance_of_radius_and_diameter | diameter]] would be $2 \times 3 \text{ meters} = 6 \text{ meters}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

### Relation to Circumference
This relationship is also fundamental to [[understanding_circumference_and_its_calculation | calculating the circumference]] of a circle. The [[understanding_circumference_and_its_calculation | circumference]] ($C$) is the distance around the circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. It is related to the [[definition_and_importance_of_radius_and_diameter | diameter]] ($D$) by the mathematical constant pi ($\pi$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>:

$$ C = \pi \times D $$

Since $D = 2 \times R$ (where $R$ is the [[definition_and_importance_of_radius_and_diameter | radius]]), the [[understanding_circumference_and_its_calculation | circumference]] can also be expressed in terms of the [[definition_and_importance_of_radius_and_diameter | radius]] as:

$$ C = 2 \times \pi \times R $$
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>

For instance, if a circle has a [[definition_and_importance_of_radius_and_diameter | radius]] of 3 meters, its [[understanding_circumference_and_its_calculation | circumference]] would be $2 \times \pi \times 3 \text{ meters} = 6\pi \text{ meters}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

Conversely, if a circle has a [[understanding_circumference_and_its_calculation | circumference]] of 10 meters, its [[definition_and_importance_of_radius_and_diameter | diameter]] would be $\frac{10}{\pi} \text{ meters}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>, and its [[definition_and_importance_of_radius_and_diameter | radius]] would be half of that, $\frac{5}{\pi} \text{ meters}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. Pi is a number approximately equal to 3.14159, and results are often left in terms of $\pi$ for simplicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

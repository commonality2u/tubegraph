[[cellular_structure_and_functions | Cells]] are defined by their internal structure, containing various specialized compartments called organelles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. An organelle is a membrane-bound subunit of a cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. This article focuses on the functions of ribosomes, the endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi bodies, which are crucial for protein synthesis and transport.

## Ribosomes

Ribosomes are complexes found throughout the [[cellular_structure_and_functions | cell]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. Some float freely in the [[cellular_structure_and_functions | cytosol]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>, while others are attached to membrane structures like the endoplasmic reticulum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

### Function
Ribosomes are the sites where [[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | mRNA]] (messenger RNA) is [[translation_of_rna_to_proteins | translated]] into proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. They convert genetic information from [[dna_and_its_function_in_cells | DNA]] (via [[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | mRNA]]) into functional proteins that can be used throughout the [[cellular_structure_and_functions | cell]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Proteins produced by free ribosomes typically float in the [[cellular_structure_and_functions | cytosol]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

### Composition and Production
Ribosomes are composed of proteins and [[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | ribosomal RNA]] (rRNA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. The [[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | ribosomal RNA]] is produced within the nucleolus, a densely packed region inside the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

## Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)

The endoplasmic reticulum is a complex system of convoluted membranes, appearing as a "bunch of tunnels" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. It is continuous with the nuclear envelope.

### Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum (Rough ER)
The rough ER is characterized by having ribosomes attached to its surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. When [[role_of_rna_in_gene_expression | mRNA]] attaches to these ribosomes, the proteins being [[translation_of_rna_to_proteins | translated]] are pushed into the inside of the ER <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. These proteins are destined for locations outside the [[cellular_structure_and_functions | cytosol]], such as [[cellular_membrane_and_its_role | cell]] membranes or for secretion outside the [[cellular_structure_and_functions | cell]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

### Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum (Smooth ER)
The smooth ER lacks attached ribosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. Proteins produced in the rough ER travel through the smooth ER <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. The smooth ER also has other functions, such as producing hormones and fatty compounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

## Golgi Bodies

Proteins that have traveled through the endoplasmic reticulum then move to the Golgi bodies (also known as the Golgi apparatus) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. The Golgi bodies appear as a stack of folded membranes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

### Function
The Golgi bodies process and package proteins, preparing them for transport to their final destinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. Proteins destined for the [[cellular_membrane_and_its_role | cell]] membrane or for release outside the [[cellular_structure_and_functions | cell]] are processed here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

### Vesicle Formation
From the Golgi bodies, proteins can "bud off" enclosed within small membrane-bound sacs called vesicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. Vesicles are general terms for small, membrane-bound structures, usually containing proteins, that float around in the [[cellular_structure_and_functions | cell]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. This membrane surrounding the protein allows it to travel to the outer [[cellular_membrane_and_its_role | membrane]] of the [[cellular_structure_and_functions | cell]] or other parts of the [[cellular_structure_and_functions | cell]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. The vesicle can then merge with the [[cellular_membrane_and_its_role | cell]] membrane, allowing the protein to exit the [[cellular_structure_and_functions | cell]] or embed itself within the [[cellular_membrane_and_its_role | membrane]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.

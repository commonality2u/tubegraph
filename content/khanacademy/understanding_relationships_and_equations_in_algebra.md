Mathematics, and specifically algebra, provides a universal language for understanding the structure of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. As Galileo Galilei stated, "Philosophy is written in that great book which ever lies before our eyes—I mean the universe—but we cannot understand it if we do not first learn the language and grasp the symbols in which it is written. This book is written in the mathematical language, without which one wanders in vain through a dark labyrinth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Algebra allows for the abstraction of ideas, revealing core concepts that apply across diverse fields like economics, finance, physics, and chemistry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. These fundamental concepts are more pure than any single application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## From Concrete to Abstract: The Discount Example

To illustrate the power of abstraction in algebra, consider a simple scenario: buying a pair of pants on sale.

Initially, if a $20 pair of pants is 30% off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, the discount is calculated as 30% times $20, which is $6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. This can be written as `0.30 * $20 = $6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### Generalizing the Product Price

To generalize this for any product in the store, we can introduce a symbol, such as `x`, to represent the non-discounted price of the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. The discount can then be expressed as `30% * x` or `0.30 * x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. This allows us to substitute any product price for `x` and quickly calculate the discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. This is the first step into the abstraction of algebra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

### Generalizing the Percentage Off

Further abstraction can be achieved by also representing the "percentage off" with a symbol. Let `p` equal the percentage off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. Now, the discount can be written as `p * x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

To make it a complete [[comparison_with_algebraic_equations|algebraic equation]], we can introduce another symbol, `y`, to represent the discount itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Thus, the relationship becomes:

`y = p * x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>

In this [[comparison_with_algebraic_equations|equation]]:
*   `y` represents the discount.
*   `p` represents the percentage off.
*   `x` represents the product's non-discounted price.

The choice of letters for these variables is arbitrary; any symbols could be used as long as their meaning is understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

## Universal Application of Algebraic Relationships

The beauty of these abstract relationships lies in their universality. The [[comparison_with_algebraic_equations|equation]] `y = p * x` can be applied to vastly different fields. For example, in physics, the formula for force is `Force = Mass * Acceleration` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. While the letters are different, the underlying relationship is identical to the discount formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. If we let `y` be Force, `p` be Mass, and `x` be Acceleration, we get the same mathematical structure: `y = p * x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

This same [[comparison_with_algebraic_equations|equation]] can be applied to:
*   Economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>
*   Finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>
*   Computer science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>
*   Logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>
*   Electrical engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>
*   Accounting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>

There are an infinite number of applications for this one simple [[comparison_with_algebraic_equations|equation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

## Manipulating Abstract Relationships

One of the core strengths of algebra is the ability to manipulate these abstract relationships. When we manipulate an [[comparison_with_algebraic_equations|equation]], we are focusing on the underlying structure of the universe, independent of specific applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

For example, if we have the [[comparison_with_algebraic_equations|equation]] `y = p * x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>, and we want to find out what `y / x` is equal to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>, we can perform the same operation on both sides of the [[comparison_with_algebraic_equations|equation]] to maintain [[understanding_the_concept_of_equality_in_algebra|equality]]:

`y / x = (p * x) / x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>

Since `x / x` equals 1 (assuming `x` is not zero), the `x` values on the right side cancel out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>, leaving us with:

`y / x = p` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>

This manipulation of the abstract [[comparison_with_algebraic_equations|equation]] reveals a new relationship. This new insight `y / x = p` then has implications for every one of the applications mentioned earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. For instance, in the discount example, it would mean `Discount / Product_Price = Percentage_Off`. In physics, it would mean `Force / Acceleration = Mass`.

Algebra provides a powerful framework to understand these fundamental truths, which can then be reapplied to countless existing and yet-to-be-discovered scenarios across the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. This is why mathematics is often considered the first common ground for communication, even with alien life forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

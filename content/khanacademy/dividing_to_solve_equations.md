When faced with equations that involve both multiplication (or division) and addition (or subtraction), a [[systematic_approach_to_solving_equations | systematic approach]] can be used to determine the value of the variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This often involves two main steps: first, isolating the variable term, and then [[solving_linear_equations_using_division_and_multiplication | solving linear equations using division and multiplication]].

## Conceptual Understanding of Equations

An equation like `3x + 5 = 17` can be visualized as three instances of an unknown value `x` plus five individual objects, all equal to seventeen individual objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

```
x + x + x  + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1  =  1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
```

A fundamental rule in [[solving_linear_equations | solving linear equations]] is that any operation performed on one side of the equation must also be performed on the other side to maintain equality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Step-by-Step Process for Solving

Let's use the example `3x + 5 = 17` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>:

### Step 1: Isolate the Variable Term

To isolate the term with the variable (`3x`), remove the constant term (`+5`) from the left side.
*   Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This is an example of [[using_subtraction_in_equations | using subtraction in equations]].

```
3x + 5 - 5 = 17 - 5
```

On the left side, `5 - 5` cancels out, leaving `3x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
On the right side, `17 - 5` equals 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

The equation simplifies to:
```
3x = 12
```

### Step 2: Solve Using Division

Now that the variable term `3x` is isolated, [[multiplication_and_division_in_equations | multiplication and division in equations]] can be applied.
*   To find the value of `x`, divide both sides of the equation by 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. This is a common [[using_algebraic_steps_to_solve_equations | algebraic step to solve equations]].

```
3x / 3 = 12 / 3
```

On the left side, `3x / 3` simplifies to `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
On the right side, `12 / 3` equals 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

Therefore:
```
x = 4
```

### Example with Negative Numbers

Consider the equation `7x - 2 = -10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

1.  **Isolate the variable term:** To get rid of `-2`, add 2 to both sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
    ```
    7x - 2 + 2 = -10 + 2
    7x = -8
    ```
    Remember that adding a positive number to a negative number moves the value to the right on a number line, closer to zero or into positive numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

2.  **Solve using division:** To find `x`, divide both sides by 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.
    ```
    7x / 7 = -8 / 7
    x = -8/7
    ```
    The answer can be left as a fraction or converted to a mixed number, `x = -1 and 1/7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

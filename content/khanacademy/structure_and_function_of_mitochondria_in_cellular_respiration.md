Mitochondria are [[Cellular membrane structure | membrane-bound organelles]] within a cell, often referred to as the "power centers of the cell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. They play a crucial role in [[cellular_respiration_process | cellular respiration]], particularly in the later [[stages_of_cellular_respiration | stages of cellular respiration]] that produce the bulk of the cell's energy currency, ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>.

## Location within the Cell

In eukaryotic cells, the mitochondria are located outside the cytoplasm, where [[glycolysis_process_and_its_role_in_breaking_down_glucose | glycolysis]] occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. The cytoplasm is the fluidic space between the cell's organelles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.

## Mitochondrial Structure

A mitochondrion has two distinct [[Cellular membrane structure | membranes]] and compartments:
*   **Outer Membrane** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>
*   **Inner Membrane** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>: This membrane is highly convoluted, forming folds called cristae (plural) or a crista (singular) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.
*   **Outer Compartment** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>: This is the space between the outer and inner membranes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.
*   **Matrix** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>: This is the inner compartment of the mitochondrion, enclosed by the inner membrane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.

## Role in Cellular Respiration Stages

While [[glycolysis_process_and_its_role_in_breaking_down_glucose | glycolysis]] occurs in the cytoplasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>, the subsequent stages of [[cellular_respiration_process | cellular respiration]] are carried out within the mitochondria:

*   **Pyruvate Oxidation**: The preparatory step for the Krebs cycle, where pyruvate is oxidized to acetyl-CoA, occurs within the mitochondria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. This process produces NADH and releases carbon dioxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.
*   **Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle)**: This cycle takes place in the matrix, the inner space of the mitochondria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. In the Krebs cycle, acetyl-CoA combines with oxaloacetic acid to form citric acid, which is then oxidized over a series of [[enzymecatalyzed_reactions_in_the_krebs_cycle | enzyme-catalyzed reactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>. This cycle produces ATP, NADH, and FADH2, and releases carbon dioxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>.
*   **Electron Transport Chain**: The NADH and FADH2 produced from [[glycolysis_process_and_its_role_in_breaking_down_glucose | glycolysis]], pyruvate oxidation, and the Krebs cycle serve as inputs for the [[electron_transport_chain_and_its_connection_to_nadh_and_fadh2 | electron transport chain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>. These molecules are oxidized in the [[electron_transport_chain_and_its_connection_to_nadh_and_fadh2 | electron transport chain]], where the bulk of ATP is actually produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>.

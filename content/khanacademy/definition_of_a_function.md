A function is an abstract concept that takes an input, "munches" on it, and produces a given output based on what that input is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. A key characteristic of a function is that for any given input, it must produce *only one* possible output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

## [[function_notation_and_usage | Function Notation]] and Examples

[[function_notation_and_usage | Function notation]] commonly uses `f` as the name of the function and `x` as the variable for the input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. However, other letters can be used for both the function name and the input variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

### Example 1: Conditional Function

A function can be defined with conditions based on the input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

```
f(x) = x²   if x is even
f(x) = x + 5 if x is odd
```
To evaluate `f(2)`:
Since 2 is even, `f(2)` is `2²`, which equals 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

To evaluate `f(3)`:
Since 3 is odd, `f(3)` is `3 + 5`, which equals 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

### Example 2: Non-Mathematical Function

Functions can also perform operations that are not strictly mathematical, demonstrating their general applicability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

```
h(a) = the next largest number that starts with the same letter as variable 'a' (assuming English)
```
To evaluate `h(2)`:
The number "2" starts with 'T'. The next largest number starting with 'T' is "3" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. So, `h(2) = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

To evaluate `h(8)`:
The number "8" starts with 'E'. The next largest number starting with 'E' is "11" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. So, `h(8) = 11` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### Example 3: Common Linear Function

Functions often represent relationships seen in traditional equations. For instance, `y = x + 1` can be viewed as a function where `y` is a function of `x`, written as `f(x) = x + 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

If `x` is 0, `f(0) = 0 + 1 = 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
If `x` is 2, `f(2) = 2 + 1 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
This relationship can be represented in a table:
| x | y |
|---|---|
| 0 | 1 |
| 2 | 3 |
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>

The benefit of [[function_notation_and_usage | function notation]] is to emphasize that the function takes an input, processes it, and produces a single output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

## [[concept_of_a_nonfunction | What is Not a Function?]]

A relationship is [[concept_of_a_nonfunction | not a function]] if a single input can lead to multiple possible outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

### Example: A Circle

Consider the equation of a circle centered at the origin with radius 2: `x² + y² = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

Graphically, if you pick an `x`-value (e.g., `x = 1`), there are two corresponding `y`-values on the circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

Solving for `y` when `x = 1`:
`1² + y² = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>
`1 + y² = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>
`y² = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>
`y = ±√3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>

Since an input of `1` yields two outputs (`√3` and `-√3`), this relationship is [[concept_of_a_nonfunction | not a function]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. A function can only have one output for a given input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

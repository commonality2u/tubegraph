A [[Definition of a function | function]] is a mathematical concept that takes an input, processes it, and produces a single, specific output based on that input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This means that for any given input, there can be only one possible output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

## Key Characteristics

*   **Input and Output**
    *   A [[Definition of a function | function]] "munches on that input" and "does something to that input" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.
    *   Based on the input, it "will produce a given output" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
*   **Unique Output**
    *   For any given input, a [[Definition of a function | function]] must produce *only one* possible output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. If an input leads to multiple outputs, it is not a [[Definition of a function | function]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## Function Notation

The most common way to denote a [[Definition of a function | function]] is using [[function_notation | function notation]] `f(x)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   `f` is typically the most-used variable for the name of a [[Definition of a function | function]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   `x` tends to be the variable most used for an input into the [[Definition of a function | function]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   However, other letters can be used, such as `h(a)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   To denote inputting a value, such as 2, into the [[Definition of a function | function]] `f`, one would write `f(2)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This is known as [[evaluating_functions | evaluating functions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Examples of Functions

### Example 1: Conditional Output
A [[Definition of a function | function]] `f(x)` can be defined with conditional rules:
*   `f(x) = x^2` if `x` is even <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   `f(x) = x + 5` if `x` is odd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

To [[evaluating_functions | evaluate]] this [[Definition of a function | function]]:
*   If the input is 2 (`f(2)`), since 2 is even, the output is `2^2 = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   If the input is 3 (`f(3)`), since 3 is odd, the output is `3 + 5 = 8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

### Example 2: Abstract Rule
A [[Definition of a function | function]] can have a very abstract rule, not limited to numerical calculations. For example, `h(a)` can be defined as "the next largest number that starts with the same letter as variable `a`" (assuming English numbers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

To [[evaluating_functions | evaluate]] this [[Definition of a function | function]]:
*   If the input is 2 (`h(2)`), since "2" starts with 'T', the next largest number starting with 'T' is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. So, `h(2) = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   If the input is 8 (`h(8)`), since "8" starts with 'E', the next largest number starting with 'E' is 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. So, `h(8) = 11` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

### Example 3: Simple Algebraic Expression
Many familiar [[definition_and_examples_of_equations | equations]] can be viewed as [[Definition of a function | functions]]. For instance, `y = x + 1` can be written using [[function_notation | function notation]] as `f(x) = x + 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   If the input is 0 (`f(0)`), the output is `0 + 1 = 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
*   If the input is 2 (`f(2)`), the output is `2 + 1 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

Using [[function_notation | function notation]] clearly indicates that the [[Definition of a function | function]] takes an input (`x`), processes it (`x + 1`), and produces an output (1 more than the input) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

## What is Not a Function?

A relationship is *not* a [[Definition of a function | function]] if a single input can lead to multiple possible outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. This is a key difference in [[function_vs_nonfunction_relationships | function vs nonfunction relationships]].

### Example: A Circle's Equation
Consider the [[definition_and_examples_of_equations | equation]] of a circle centered at the origin with radius 2:
```
x^2 + y^2 = 4
```
This [[definition_and_examples_of_equations | equation]] represents a relationship, but it is not a [[Definition of a function | function]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

Graphically, if `x = 1`, there are two corresponding y-values: one above the x-axis and one below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

Mathematically, for `x = 1`:
```
1^2 + y^2 = 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>
1 + y^2 = 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>
y^2 = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>
y = ±√3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>
```
Since inputting `x = 1` yields two different outputs (`√3` and `-√3`), this relationship is not a [[Definition of a function | function]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. A [[Definition of a function | function]] can only have one output for a given input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

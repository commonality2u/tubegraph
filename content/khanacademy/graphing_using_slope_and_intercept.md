Linear equations can be represented in various forms, but one particularly useful representation for [[graphing linear equations | graphing]] is [[slopeintercept_form | slope-intercept form]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This form makes it straightforward to [[identifying_slope_and_yintercept | identify the slope and y-intercept]] of the line, which are key components for plotting its graph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Representing Linear Equations

A linear equation can be written in an infinite number of ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. For instance, the equation `y = 2x + 3` can also be expressed as:
*   `-2x + y = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   `y - 5 = 2(x - 1)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>

All these forms are algebraically equivalent and can be derived from one another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. However, `y = 2x + 3` is an example of [[slopeintercept_form | slope-intercept form]], which is highly beneficial for [[graphing linear equations | graphing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## [[slopeintercept_form | Slope-Intercept Form]]

The general [[slopeintercept_form | slope-intercept form]] of a linear equation is `y = mx + b`, where:
*   `m` represents the [[slope of a line in algebra | slope]] of the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>
*   `b` represents the y-intercept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>

This form explicitly solves for `y`, making the slope and y-intercept readily apparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

## [[graphing_linear_equations | Graphing a Linear Equation]] using Slope-Intercept Form

Let's use the example `y = 2x + 3` to demonstrate [[graphing linear equations | graphing]] using [[slopeintercept_form | slope-intercept form]].

### Finding the Y-Intercept

The y-intercept is the point where the line crosses the y-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. This occurs when `x` is equal to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

For `y = 2x + 3`:
1.  Set `x = 0`: `y = 2(0) + 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>
2.  Calculate `y`: `y = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>
3.  The y-intercept is the point `(0, 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

This point `(0, 3)` should be plotted on the y-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. In [[slopeintercept_form | slope-intercept form]] (`y = mx + b`), the constant term `b` directly tells you the y-coordinate of the y-intercept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

### [[understanding_slope_from_a_graph | Understanding Slope]]

The [[slope of a straight line | slope]] (`m`) is the ratio of the change in `y` (`Δy`) to the change in `x` (`Δx`) between any two points on the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. It describes the steepness and direction of the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

For `y = 2x + 3`, the coefficient of `x` is `2`, so the [[slope of a line in algebra | slope]] is `2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. This means for every `1` unit increase in `x`, `y` increases by `2` units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

To use the slope for [[graphing linear equations | graphing]]:
1.  Start from the y-intercept `(0, 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
2.  Apply the slope (`m = 2 = 2/1`):
    *   Increase `x` by `1` (move `1` unit right).
    *   Increase `y` by `2` (move `2` units up).
3.  This leads to the point `(0+1, 3+2) = (1, 5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
    *   *(Verification: If `x = 1`, `y = 2(1) + 3 = 5`)* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
4.  Plot this new point `(1, 5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

You only need two points to define a line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. Once you have plotted the y-intercept and at least one other point derived from the slope, you can draw a straight line through them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

You can also move in the negative direction:
*   From `(0, 3)`, if `Δx = -1`, then `Δy = -2`.
*   This leads to `(0-1, 3-2) = (-1, 1)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

This method allows for quick [[graphing linear equations | graphing]] and visual [[understanding slope from a graph | understanding of the slope]] and intercept.

## Benefits of [[slopeintercept_form | Slope-Intercept Form]] for [[identifying_slope_and_y_intercept | Identifying Slope and Y-Intercept]]

[[slopeintercept_form | Slope-intercept form]] is considered the easiest way to visualize the graph of a linear equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

Consider the equation `y = -x + 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>:
*   **Y-intercept**: The constant term is `2`, so the y-intercept is `(0, 2)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. The line will cross the y-axis at `y = 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   **Slope**: The coefficient of `x` is `-1`, so the slope is `-1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. This means for every `1` unit increase in `x`, `y` will decrease by `1` unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

```
Graphing Summary:
y = mx + b
- 'b' is your y-intercept (where the line crosses the y-axis, at x=0).
- 'm' is your slope (rise over run, or change in y / change in x).
```

By using the y-intercept as a starting point and the slope to find additional points, you can efficiently and accurately [[graphing linear equations | graph linear equations]] expressed in [[slopeintercept_form | slope-intercept form]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

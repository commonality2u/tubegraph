## Prerequisites

To perform [[division_with_larger_numbers | division]] effectively, especially with larger numbers, it is crucial to know your [[importance_of_multiplication_tables_in_division | multiplication tables]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Ideally, this includes tables from 1 times 1 all the way to at least 10 times 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. While some curricula extend to 12 times 12, knowing up to 10 times 10 is usually sufficient for many problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Understanding Basic Division

Division can be conceptualized as the inverse of [[understanding_basic_multiplication | multiplication]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

> For example, to solve 25 divided by 5, you can ask: "5 times what is 25?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
> If you know your [[importance_of_multiplication_tables_in_division | 5-multiplication tables]], you'll quickly identify that 5 times 5 is 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Therefore, 25 divided by 5 equals 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
>
> Similarly, for 49 divided by 7, the question is "7 times what is 49?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. The answer, from your [[importance_of_multiplication_tables_in_division | multiplication tables]], is 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
>
> For 54 divided by 9, you consider "9 times what is 54?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This requires knowing that 9 times 6 equals 54 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. So, 9 goes into 54 six times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

When writing the quotient (the answer), ensure it's placed correctly according to its place value. For 25 divided by 5, the 5 is written in the ones place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## [[handling_division_with_remainders | Division with Remainders]]

Not all [[division_with_larger_numbers | division]] problems result in a whole number quotient. In such cases, there is a remainder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

> ### Example: 23 divided by 3
>
> 1.  **List multiples:** List the multiples of 3: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
> 2.  **Find largest multiple:** Notice that 23 is not a multiple of 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Find the largest multiple of 3 that is less than or equal to 23. This is 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
> 3.  **Determine how many times:** 3 goes into 21 seven times (since 3 x 7 = 21) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. So, 3 goes into 23 seven times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
> 4.  **Calculate remainder:** Subtract the multiple (21) from the dividend (23): 23 - 21 = 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This difference is the remainder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
>
> So, 23 divided by 3 is 7 remainder 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## [[division_with_larger_numbers | Dividing Larger Numbers]] (Long Division)

For [[division_with_larger_numbers | larger numbers]] that extend beyond the basic [[importance_of_multiplication_tables_in_division | multiplication tables]], a step-by-step process, known as long division, is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

> ### Example: 344 divided by 4
>
> 1.  **Divide the first digit:** Start with the leftmost digit of the dividend (344). How many times does 4 go into 3? It goes in 0 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
> 2.  **Consider the next digit:** Since 4 doesn't go into 3, consider the first two digits: 34 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
> 3.  **Divide (first part):** How many times does 4 go into 34? Using [[importance_of_multiplication_tables_in_division | multiplication tables]], 4 times 8 is 32, and 4 times 9 is 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Since 36 is larger than 34, 4 goes into 34 eight times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
> 4.  **Write quotient digit:** Write the "8" above the "4" in the tens place of 344 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
> 5.  **Multiply:** Multiply the quotient digit (8) by the divisor (4): 8 times 4 equals 32 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
> 6.  **Subtract:** Subtract this product from the part of the dividend you were working with: 34 minus 32 equals 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
> 7.  **Bring down:** Bring down the next digit from the dividend (4) to form a new number with the remainder (2), making it 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
> 8.  **Divide (second part):** How many times does 4 go into 24? 4 times 6 is exactly 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
> 9.  **Write quotient digit:** Write the "6" above the "4" in the ones place of 344 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
> 10. **Multiply and Subtract:** Multiply 6 by 4 (24), and subtract from 24. This leaves a remainder of 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
>
> The result is 86 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

### Additional Examples:

> ### Example: 91 divided by 7
>
> 1.  **Divide 7 into 9:** 7 goes into 9 one time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. Write "1" above the "9".
> 2.  **Multiply and subtract:** 1 times 7 is 7. 9 minus 7 is 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
> 3.  **Bring down:** Bring down the "1" to make 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
> 4.  **Divide 7 into 21:** 7 goes into 21 three times (since 7 times 3 is 21) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. Write "3" above the "1".
> 5.  **Multiply and subtract:** 3 times 7 is 21. 21 minus 21 is 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
>
> The result is 13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

> ### Example: 608 divided by 8
>
> 1.  **Divide 8 into 6:** 8 goes into 6 zero times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
> 2.  **Consider 60:** How many times does 8 go into 60? 8 times 7 is 56, and 8 times 8 is 64 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. Since 64 is too large, 8 goes into 60 seven times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. Write "7" above the "0" in 60.
> 3.  **Multiply and subtract:** 7 times 8 is 56. 60 minus 56 is 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
> 4.  **Bring down:** Bring down the "8" to make 48 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.
> 5.  **Divide 8 into 48:** 8 times 6 is exactly 48 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. Write "6" above the "8".
> 6.  **Multiply and subtract:** 6 times 8 is 48. 48 minus 48 is 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
>
> The result is 76 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

This step-by-step method allows you to tackle [[division_with_larger_numbers | larger division problems]] by breaking them down into smaller, manageable steps using your fundamental knowledge of [[importance_of_multiplication_tables_in_division | multiplication tables]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

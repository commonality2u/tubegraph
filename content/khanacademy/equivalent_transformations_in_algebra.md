Solving an algebraic equation like `7x = 14` involves understanding what the expression means and then applying systematic methods to find the unknown variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While some [[comparison_with_algebraic_equations|equations]] can be solved mentally by going through multiplication tables (e.g., 7 times 2 equals 14) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, more complex equations require a systematic approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. It is crucial to know how to [[performing_legitimate_algebraic_operations|manipulate equations]] and [[understanding_relationships_and_equations_in_algebra|understand what they represent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Understanding Algebraic Expressions

The term `7x` literally means "7 times x" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. In [[the_abstraction_and_generalization_in_algebra|algebra]], the multiplication sign is typically omitted between a number and a variable, or between two variables, as a shorthand notation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This is because the letter 'x' is frequently used as a variable, and including a multiplication 'x' sign could lead to confusion (e.g., appearing as 'xx' or 'times times') <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Sometimes, a dot (`·`) might be used to denote multiplication (e.g., `7 · x`), but `7x` is the most common notation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## [[visualizing_algebraic_operations|Visualizing Algebraic Operations]]

To grasp how to [[algebraic_techniques_for_solving_equations|manipulate equations]], it's helpful to visualize them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. For instance, `7x` can be understood as `x` added to itself seven times:
`x + x + x + x + x + x + x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

If `7x` is equal to 14, then having seven 'x' objects is equivalent to having 14 distinct objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Principle of Equality

The fundamental rule for [[understanding_the_concept_of_equality_in_algebra|understanding the concept of equality in algebra]] is that an equation states that the left-hand side is equal to the right-hand side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Therefore, any operation performed on one side of the equation must also be performed on the other side to maintain the equality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

### Applying Division

When an equation is in the form of a coefficient (a number multiplying the variable) times a variable (e.g., `7x`), equated to another number (e.g., `14`), the goal is to isolate the variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. This is achieved by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

*   **Example 1**: Solve `7x = 14`
    1.  Divide both sides by 7:
        `7x / 7 = 14 / 7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>
    2.  The 7's on the left cancel out, leaving `x`:
        `x = 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>
    This means if you divide the seven 'x's into seven groups, each group is one 'x', and if you divide the 14 objects into seven groups, each group contains two objects, so each 'x' must be equal to 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

*   **Example 2**: Solve `3x = 15`
    1.  Divide both sides by 3:
        `3x / 3 = 15 / 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>
    2.  This simplifies to:
        `x = 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>

### Applying Multiplication (Reciprocal)

Dividing by a number is equivalent to multiplying by its reciprocal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
*   **Example**: Solve `3x = 15`
    1.  Instead of dividing by 3, multiply both sides by 1/3:
        `1/3 * 3x = 1/3 * 15` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>
    2.  `1/3 * 3` is 1, so the left side becomes `1x` (which is simply `x`):
        `x = 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>

## Combining [[understanding_like_terms_in_algebra|Like Terms]]

Before applying division or multiplication, equations may require simplifying by combining [[understanding_like_terms_in_algebra|like terms]].
*   **Example**: Solve `2y + 4y = 18` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>
    1.  [[visualizing_algebraic_operations|Visualize]] `2y` as `y + y` and `4y` as `y + y + y + y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
    2.  Counting all the 'y's shows there are six of them: `y + y + y + y + y + y = 6y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
    3.  Thus, `2y + 4y` simplifies to `6y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
    4.  The equation becomes `6y = 18` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
    5.  Now, divide both sides by 6:
        `6y / 6 = 18 / 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>
    6.  This yields:
        `y = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>

### Verification

A useful step after solving an equation is to verify the answer by substituting the solution back into the original equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
*   For `2y + 4y = 18` and `y = 3`:
    `2 * 3 + 4 * 3 = 18` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>
    `6 + 12 = 18` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>
    `18 = 18` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>
    Since the equality holds, the solution is correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

Solving equations systematically is crucial, especially as they become more complex and cannot be solved by simply guessing or trying numbers in your head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. A key understanding is that an equation states that two things are equal, and any operation performed on one side must also be performed on the other to maintain this equality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. This ensures the equation remains balanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. This approach is part of [[using_algebraic_steps_to_solve_equations|using algebraic steps to solve equations]] and forms the basis for [[algebraic_approach_to_balancing_equations|balancing equations]].

## Understanding Algebraic Notation

In algebra, when a number is written next to a variable (e.g., 7x), it signifies multiplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This is a shorthand notation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The traditional multiplication sign (x) is generally avoided because the letter 'x' is the most common variable used in algebra, which can lead to confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Sometimes, a dot (·) is used to represent multiplication, such as 7·x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, but for a number and a variable, 7x is the most common and clear notation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Solving Basic Linear Equations

To solve an equation where a coefficient (the number multiplying the variable) is present, the goal is to isolate the variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

### Example: 7x = 14

The equation 7x = 14 literally means "7 times x is equal to 14" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This also means x added to itself 7 times equals 14 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

To solve for x:
1.  **Identify the coefficient:** The coefficient is 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
2.  **Divide both sides by the coefficient:** Divide both sides of the equation by 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
    *   7x / 7 = 14 / 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>
    *   The 7's on the left side cancel out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
    *   x = 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>

Visually, if you have 7 groups of 'x' equal to 14 objects, dividing by 7 means splitting both sides into 7 equivalent groups. Each 'x' will then be equal to two objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

### Example: 3x = 15

1.  **Divide both sides by 3:**
    *   3x / 3 = 15 / 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>
    *   x = 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>

Alternatively, dividing by 3 is equivalent to multiplying both sides by 1/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>:
*   (1/3) * 3x = (1/3) * 15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>
*   1x = 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>
*   x = 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>

## Solving Equations with Combined Terms

Sometimes, an equation might have multiple terms involving the same variable. The first step is to combine these like terms.

### Example: 2y + 4y = 18

1.  **Combine like terms:** 2y means two 'y's added together (y + y), and 4y means four 'y's added together (y + y + y + y) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. Adding these gives a total of six 'y's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.
    *   2y + 4y = 6y <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>
    *   The equation becomes: 6y = 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>
2.  **Solve for y:** Now, use the same method as above. Divide both sides by the coefficient, 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
    *   6y / 6 = 18 / 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>
    *   y = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>

## Verifying Your Solution

One of the benefits of solving equations is that you can always check your answer by plugging the solution back into the original equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

For 2y + 4y = 18, with y = 3:
*   2(3) + 4(3) = 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>
*   6 + 12 = 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>
*   18 = 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>

Since the equality holds true, the solution is correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

Solving equations systematically is crucial, especially as they become more complex, making it difficult to solve them mentally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. This approach ensures that the solution is found reliably, even when direct mental calculation is not feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.

## Understanding Equations

An equation like `7x = 14` means that 7 times a number (represented by `x`) is equal to 14 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. In [[understanding_linear_equations | algebra]], when a number is written next to a variable (e.g., `7x`), it implies multiplication, serving as a shorthand notation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. The traditional multiplication sign (`x`) is generally avoided to prevent confusion with the variable `x`, which is commonly used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. Sometimes a dot (`â€¢`) might be used, but `7x` is the most common notation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.

Visually, `7x` represents `x` added to itself 7 times (e.g., `x + x + x + x + x + x + x`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. If `7x` is equal to 14, it means these seven instances of `x` combined are equivalent to 14 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.

## Solving Equations Using Division

One of the fundamental [[algebraic_techniques_for_solving_equations | algebraic techniques]] for [[solving_algebraic_equations | solving equations]] is to isolate the variable. When an equation is simplified to a coefficient (a number multiplying the variable) times a variable, equal to another number, the goal is to divide both sides by the coefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

### Example: `7x = 14`

To [[solving_simple_linear_equations | solve]] `7x = 14` systematically:
1.  **Identify the coefficient**: The coefficient of `x` is 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.
2.  **Divide both sides by the coefficient**:
    ```
    7x / 7 = 14 / 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>
    ```
3.  **Simplify**:
    ```
    x = 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>
    ```

This division visually means that if seven `x`'s are equal to 14 objects, then dividing both sides by 7 means each `x` is equal to two objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. Any operation performed on one side of an equation must also be performed on the other side to maintain equality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>.

### Division vs. Multiplication by Reciprocal

Dividing both sides of an equation by a number is equivalent to multiplying both sides by the reciprocal of that number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>.

For example, to solve `3x = 15`:
*   **Divide by 3**:
    ```
    3x / 3 = 15 / 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>
    x = 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>
    ```
*   **Multiply by 1/3 (the reciprocal of 3)**:
    ```
    (1/3) * 3x = 15 * (1/3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>
    1x = 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>
    x = 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>
    ```

## Combining Like Terms

When an equation involves multiple terms with the same variable, these "like terms" can be combined before isolating the variable.

### Example: `2y + 4y = 18`

1.  **Visualize the terms**: `2y` means `y + y`, and `4y` means `y + y + y + y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>.
2.  **Combine like terms**: Counting all the `y`'s on the left side: `y + y + y + y + y + y = 6y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>.
    *   This is analogous to adding apples: 2 apples plus 4 apples equals 6 apples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>.
3.  **Rewrite the equation**:
    ```
    6y = 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:00">[09:45:00]</a>
    ```
4.  **Solve by division**: Divide both sides by the coefficient (6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>.
    ```
    6y / 6 = 18 / 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>
    y = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>
    ```

### Checking the Solution

After [[solving_algebraic_equations | solving an equation]], it's a good practice to check the answer by substituting the calculated value back into the original equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>.

For `2y + 4y = 18` with `y = 3`:
1.  Substitute `y` with `3`:
    ```
    2(3) + 4(3) = 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>
    ```
2.  Perform the multiplications:
    ```
    6 + 12 = 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:00">[10:52:00]</a>
    ```
3.  Perform the addition:
    ```
    18 = 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:00">[10:59:00]</a>
    ```
Since both sides are equal, the solution is correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>.

The [[pythagorean_theorem_in_right_triangles | Pythagorean theorem]] is a fundamental principle used to determine unknown side lengths in [[trigonometric_functions_definition_for_right_triangles | right triangles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This theorem states that the square of the hypotenuse (`h`) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Calculating the Hypotenuse

To find the hypotenuse in a [[trigonometric_functions_definition_for_right_triangles | right triangle]] when the lengths of the other two sides are known, apply the [[pythagorean_theorem_in_right_triangles | Pythagorean theorem]].

### Example 1: Sides 7 and 4

Consider a [[trigonometric_functions_and_right_triangles | right triangle]] with side lengths of 7 and 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. To find the hypotenuse (`h`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>:

1.  **Set up the equation** using the [[pythagorean_theorem_in_right_triangles | Pythagorean theorem]]:
    `h² = 7² + 4²` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>
    `h² = 49 + 16` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>

2.  **Calculate the sum of the squares**:
    `49 + 16 = 65` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>
    So, `h² = 65` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

3.  **Solve for `h` by taking the square root**:
    `h = √65` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>

    *Note*: The square root of 65 cannot be simplified further, as 65 is `13 × 5`, and both 13 and 5 are prime numbers that are not perfect squares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

### Example 2: Verifying a 30-60-90 Triangle

The [[pythagorean_theorem_in_right_triangles | Pythagorean theorem]] can also be used to verify if given side lengths form a [[trigonometric_functions_and_right_triangles | right triangle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. For a triangle with sides `2√3` and `2`, and a hypotenuse of `4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>:

1.  **Square the two shorter sides and sum them**:
    `(2√3)² + 2²` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>
    `= (4 × 3) + 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>
    `= 12 + 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>
    `= 16` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>

2.  **Compare to the square of the hypotenuse**:
    The hypotenuse is 4, and `4² = 16` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
    Since `16 = 16`, the triangle satisfies the [[pythagorean_theorem_in_right_triangles | Pythagorean theorem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>, confirming it is a [[trigonometric_functions_and_right_triangles | right triangle]] and specifically an [[understanding_and_applying_trigonometric_ratios_in_306090_triangles | 30-60-90 triangle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

> [!info] The [[pythagorean_theorem_in_right_triangles | Pythagorean theorem]] and [[trigonometric_functions_definition_for_right_triangles | trigonometric functions]] (e.g., [[using_soh_cah_toa_to_determine_trigonometric_ratios | SOH CAH TOA]]) are only directly applicable to [[trigonometric_functions_and_right_triangles | right triangles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. If working with angles not part of [[trigonometric_functions_and_right_triangles | right triangles]], it may be necessary to construct [[trigonometric_functions_and_right_triangles | right triangles]] within the given figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## What is Chemistry?

When people think of chemistry, they often imagine scientists working with vials of chemicals, some boiling and changing colors, or a "mad scientist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Chemistry is also commonly associated with [[definition_and_purpose_of_chemical_equations | chemical equations]], which describe how different substances react to form new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, or with models of molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The [[role_of_periodic_table_in_chemistry | periodic table of elements]] is another strong association <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. While these elements are a significant part of chemistry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, its essence lies in understanding and making models and predictions about our reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Historical Evolution of Understanding

The [[role_of_periodic_table_in_chemistry | periodic table of elements]], a staple in any chemistry classroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, represents thousands of years of human effort to comprehend the complexity of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Looking at the universe, we observe a vast array of substancesâ€”fire, rock, water, meteorological patterns, and the intricate complexity of life, including the electrochemical interactions in the human brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This apparent infinite spectrum of differentness can be overwhelming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

Over millennia, humanity began to make sense of this complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. A key realization was that despite the apparent diversity, everything is composed of basic building blocks, much like Legos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. There isn't an infinite number of these blocks; rather, there's a finite set of elements, with new ones discovered less frequently now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Many seemingly different substances are simply various compositions of common elements like carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. These elements themselves are formed from protons, [[electrons_and_chemical_reactions | electrons]], and neutrons, rearranged in different ways to give elements their distinct properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

Ultimately, chemistry aims to create and understand models that describe much of the universe's complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

## Chemistry's Place Among Sciences

Chemistry is situated within a hierarchy of sciences, demonstrating the [[interrelation_of_chemistry_physics_and_biology | interrelation of chemistry physics and biology]] and other fields:

1.  **Mathematics**: Considered the purest level, mathematics studies ideas and logical concepts that can be independent of observed reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. It's often seen as a universal language that could communicate with other intelligent species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
2.  **Physics**: Built upon mathematics, physics explores the fundamental structure of reality, the constituents of matter, and the mathematical properties governing their interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
3.  **Chemistry**: Closely related to physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, chemistry builds upon physics to understand how building blocks interact to explain various phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. For example, the [[introduction_to_chemical_equations | chemical equations]] used in chemistry, such as those describing combustion (hydrogen and oxygen producing energy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, are rooted in quantum mechanical interactions, which are not yet fully understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
4.  **Biology**: Chemistry forms the foundation for biology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Biological processes, whether in humans or other species, are based on molecular interactions between atoms and molecules, which are fundamentally chemical in nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Even human speech involves an immense number of chemical interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
5.  **Social Sciences**: Building on biology, fields like psychology and economics emerge, though they also leverage mathematics and other principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

These sciences are interconnected, with boundaries often blurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. None is more important than the other; they all study fascinating aspects of existence, addressing fundamental human questions like "Why are we here?" and "How do we exist?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## Significance and Future of Chemistry

Chemistry develops models to understand interactions at scales and speeds that cannot be directly observed, yet allow for predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. Learning chemistry today is a privilege; the knowledge available in chemistry textbooks or through teachers and online resources like Khan Academy videos was sought after by people just a century ago who would have "done anything" to obtain it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

Chemistry, like all scientific fields, is far from complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. Our current knowledge is partial, with arguably an infinite amount more to learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. However, humanity has made a strong start in making sense of and describing the reality around us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. The [[importance_of_chemistry_in_understanding_the_universe | importance of chemistry in understanding the universe]] continues to grow as we push the boundaries of discovery.

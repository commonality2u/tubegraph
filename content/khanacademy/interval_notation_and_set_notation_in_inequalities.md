When [[solving_absolute_value_inequalities | solving inequalities]] involving [[solving_absolute_value_inequalities | absolute values]], it's important to clearly express the solution set. This can be done using either interval notation or set notation.

## Understanding the Solution Set

The "solution set" refers to all the values of the variable (e.g., 'x') that satisfy the given inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. [[visualizing_number_line_for_inequalities | Visualizing a number line]] can be very helpful in determining this set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Examples of Notation

### Case 1: Absolute Value Less Than a Number

Consider the inequality: `|x| < 12` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
This means we are looking for all 'x' values that are less than 12 units away from 0 on the [[visualizing_number_line_for_inequalities | number line]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This range is between -12 and +12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

*   **Set Notation:**
    This can be written as `x > -12 and x < 12` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
    Alternatively, it can be combined into a [[compound_inequalities_with_absolute_values | compound inequality]]: `-12 < x < 12` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   **Interval Notation:**
    The solution set is expressed as `(-12, 12)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. The parentheses indicate that the numbers -12 and 12 are *not* included in the solution set.

Another example: `|5x + 3| < 7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.
This means `5x + 3` must be between -7 and 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
Solving this leads to `x > -2` and `x < 4/5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

*   **Set Notation:**
    `x > -2 and x < 4/5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
    Or, `-2 < x < 4/5`.
*   **Interval Notation:**
    `(-2, 4/5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

### Case 2: Absolute Value Greater Than or Equal To a Number

Consider the inequality: `|7x| >= 21` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
This means `7x` must be 21 or more units away from 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

*   **Set Notation:**
    This implies two separate conditions:
    1.  `7x >= 21` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a> (meaning `7x` is greater than or equal to positive 21).
    2.  `7x <= -21` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a> (meaning `7x` is less than or equal to negative 21, so its [[solving_absolute_value_inequalities | absolute value]] is also greater than 21).
    Solving these yields `x >= 3` or `x <= -3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
    The solution set is `x >= 3` or `x <= -3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   **Interval Notation:**
    `(negative infinity, -3]` union `[3, positive infinity)`. The square brackets indicate that -3 and 3 are *included* in the solution set.

### Case 3: More Complex Absolute Value Inequality

Consider `|2x/7 + 9| > 5/7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
This requires that `2x/7 + 9` is more than 5/7 units away from 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

*   **Set Notation:**
    This leads to two separate [[compound_inequalities_with_absolute_values | inequalities]]:
    1.  `2x/7 + 9 > 5/7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>, which simplifies to `x > -29` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.
    2.  `2x/7 + 9 < -5/7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>, which simplifies to `x < -34` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
    The solution set is `x > -29` or `x < -34` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   **Interval Notation:**
    `(negative infinity, -34)` union `(-29, positive infinity)`.

Chemistry is often associated with scientists working with vials of chemicals, observing them boil or change colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. People also connect chemistry with [[chemical_equations | chemical equations]], which illustrate how different substances [[chemical_reactions | react]] to form new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Other common associations include models of molecules and the periodic table of elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## The Essence of Chemistry
At its core, chemistry is a science that helps humanity understand, model, and predict reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The complexity of the universe, from fire and rock to meteorological patterns and the intricate electrochemical interactions within the human brain, can be overwhelming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Over thousands of years, humans have sought to make sense of this diversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

A key realization is that all the complexity observed in the world is made of basic building blocks, much like LEGOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. These building blocks are the elements, and there is a finite number of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Many common substances are different compositions of elements such as carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Elements themselves are composed of protons, electrons, and neutrons, which are rearranged to give elements their distinct properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## Chemistry's Role in Science
Chemistry creates and interprets models that describe the complexity of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. It builds upon physics, which explores the most basic constituents of matter and the mathematical properties governing their interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. [[chemical_equations | Chemical equations]] and molecular structures represent interactions between atoms, which are governed by quantum mechanical principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. Chemistry leverages math and physics to understand how these building blocks interact to explain various phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

For instance, the [[chemical_equations | chemical equation]] for combustion, where hydrogen reacts with oxygen to produce energy, helps explain phenomena like fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Beyond physics, chemistry serves as the foundation for biology, as biological processes, such as human speech, rely on countless molecular interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

Ultimately, chemistry allows for the creation of models to understand interactions at scales and speeds not directly observable, enabling predictions about the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. While human knowledge in all scientific fields remains partial, the progress made in chemistry provides a strong foundation for continued understanding and discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

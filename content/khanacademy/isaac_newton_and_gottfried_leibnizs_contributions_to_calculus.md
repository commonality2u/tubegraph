Isaac Newton, a renowned British mathematician and physicist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, and Gottfried Leibniz, a prominent German philosopher and mathematician who was a contemporary of Newton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, are collectively recognized as the founding fathers of calculus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. They conducted most of their significant work in the late 1600s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## The Fundamental Question

Both Newton and Leibniz were driven by the same fundamental question that [[differential_calculus_and_rates_of_change | differential calculus]] aims to answer: what is the instantaneous rate of change of something? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. For example, for a sprinter like Usain Bolt, this question translates to "how fast is he going *right now*?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This differs from average speed, which considers the total distance over a period of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Differential Calculus

[[differential_calculus_and_rates_of_change | Differential calculus]] is specifically focused on instantaneous rates of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Newton's original term for [[differential_calculus_and_rates_of_change | differential calculus]] was the "method of fluxions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. The core idea is to understand what is happening at a specific instant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### Connecting to instantaneous change

Traditional [[historical_development_of_algebra | algebra]] can calculate average rates of change (like the slope between two points on a graph) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. However, when a rate of change is constantly shifting, as in the case of a sprinter accelerating and decelerating, the average slope doesn't capture the speed at any single moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

To find the instantaneous rate of change, one must consider what happens as the "change in x" (or time) becomes infinitely small, approaching zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. This concept is formalized by taking the [[concept_of_approaching_values_in_calculus | limit]] as delta x approaches zero of the change in y over the change in x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. This process yields the instantaneous rate of change, which can be visualized as the slope of the tangent line at a specific point on a curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. In calculus terminology, this instantaneous slope is known as the [[concept_of_derivatives_and_differential_calculus | derivative]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

The notation `dy/dx` represents the [[concept_of_derivatives_and_differential_calculus | derivative]], where `dy` and `dx` are "differentials"â€”infinitely small changes in y and x, respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. This concept of taking the [[concept_of_approaching_values_in_calculus | limit]] as the change approaches zero is crucial because direct division by zero is undefined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. The rigorous definition of this process is fundamental to the [[introduction_to_limits_in_calculus | introduction to limits in calculus]] and will be explored in further detail in subsequent discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

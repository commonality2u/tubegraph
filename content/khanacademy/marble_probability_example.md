This article explains how to calculate the [[introduction_to_probability|probability]] of pulling a specific colored marble from a bag, using a simple example.

## The Problem Statement

The goal is to find the [[probability_calculation|probability]] of pulling a yellow marble from a bag containing 3 yellow, 2 red, 2 green, and 1 blue marble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Understanding Probability

[[introduction_to_probability|Probability]], often denoted as 'p', is a way of measuring the likelihood of something happening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. It's calculated by determining how many outcomes satisfy a specific event compared to the total number of possible outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The "event in question" for this problem is picking a yellow marble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Identifying Possible Outcomes

The "possible outcomes" refer to all the potential results when a marble is picked from the bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This set of all possible outcomes is sometimes called the [[sample_space_in_probability|sample space]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

The marbles in the bag are:
*   3 yellow marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>
*   2 red marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   2 green marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>
*   1 blue marble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>

### Total Number of Possible Outcomes

To find the total number of possible outcomes, sum the number of each color of marble:
3 (yellow) + 2 (red) + 2 (green) + 1 (blue) = 8 marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
Therefore, there are 8 possible outcomes when picking a marble from the bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This is considered the size of the [[sample_space_in_probability|sample space]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

### Number of Outcomes Satisfying the Event

The event in question is picking a yellow marble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. There are 3 yellow marbles in the bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. These 3 outcomes satisfy the event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## Calculating the Probability

The [[probability_calculation|probability]] of an event is calculated as:
$$ P(\text{Event}) = \frac{\text{Number of outcomes satisfying the event}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} $$

In this example:
*   Number of outcomes satisfying the event (picking yellow) = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>
*   Total number of possible outcomes = 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>

So, the [[probability_calculation|probability]] of picking a yellow marble is:
$$ P(\text{Yellow}) = \frac{3}{8} $$

This means that out of 8 different marbles that could be picked, 3 of them are yellow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

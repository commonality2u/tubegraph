[[understanding_probability_concepts | Probability]] is a way of measuring the likelihood that something will happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This example demonstrates how to [[calculating_probability | calculate probability]] for a specific outcome.

## The Problem
Find the [[calculating_probabilities_for_specific_outcomes | probability of pulling]] a yellow marble from a bag containing 3 yellow, 2 red, 2 green, and 1 blue marble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Key Concepts in Probability
When [[calculating_probability | calculating probability]], it's helpful to define a few terms:

*   **[[Trial and event in probability | Trial]]:** The action or experiment being performed, such as picking a marble out of a bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   **[[Trial and event in probability | Event]]:** The specific outcome of interest within a trial, in this case, picking a yellow marble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

The [[calculating_probability | probability]] is determined by comparing the number of outcomes that satisfy the event to the total number of possible outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Quantifying Outcomes
To [[quantifying_outcomes_for_probability | quantify outcomes]] for this problem:

### Total Possible Outcomes (Sample Space)
The "sample space" refers to the set of all possible outcomes of a trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. In this bag, the total number of marbles represents the total possible outcomes:
*   3 Yellow marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>
*   2 Red marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   2 Green marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>
*   1 Blue marble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>

Adding these together: 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 8 possible outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### Favorable Outcomes
The outcomes that satisfy the event (picking a yellow marble) are the yellow marbles in the bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. There are 3 yellow marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, so there are 3 outcomes that allow the event to occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## Calculating the Probability
The [[calculating_probability | probability of picking]] a yellow marble is calculated as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total possible outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>:

*   Number of outcomes satisfying the event (yellow marbles): 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>
*   Number of possible outcomes (total marbles): 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>

Therefore, the probability of picking a yellow marble is 3/8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

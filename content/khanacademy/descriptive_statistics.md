[[introduction_to_statistics | Statistics]] serves as a method to comprehend and manage data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. It is fundamentally centered around data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

A significant part of the journey into [[introduction_to_statistics | statistics]] involves [[descriptive_statistics | descriptive statistics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## What is Descriptive Statistics?
[[descriptive_statistics | Descriptive statistics]] focuses on summarizing and describing a large set of data using a smaller set of numbers, rather than presenting all raw data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This contrasts with [[inferential_statistics | inferential statistics]], which involves making conclusions, judgments, and inferences about data after a toolkit for descriptive statistics is built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Describing Data: Finding a "Typical" Number
When faced with a set of numbers, such as plant heights (e.g., 4, 3, 1, 6, 1, 7 inches) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, a common goal is to represent all these different values with a single number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This single number aims to be "typical," "middle," "most frequent," or represent the "center" of all numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This concept aligns with the historical development of [[descriptive_statistics | descriptive statistics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## Measures of Central Tendency
The attempt to find a number that is typical, middle, or central to a data set is known as finding a [[measures_of_central_tendency | measure of central tendency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. While "average" in everyday language often refers to the arithmetic mean, in [[introduction_to_statistics | statistics]], "average" is a more general term encompassing any typical or middle number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. There are several types of averages:

### Arithmetic Mean
The [[mean_or_central_tendency_in_statistics | arithmetic mean]] is the most commonly understood "average" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. It is calculated by summing all the numbers in a data set and then dividing by the total count of numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. This definition is a human-constructed concept found to be useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

**Example Calculation:**
For the plant heights data set (4, 3, 1, 6, 1, 7 inches) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>:
*   Sum: 4 + 3 + 1 + 6 + 1 + 7 = 22 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>
*   Number of data points: 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>
*   Arithmetic Mean: 22 / 6 = 3 and 4/6 = 3 and 2/3 (or 3.6 repeating) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>

### Median
The median is the literal middle number in a data set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. To find the median, the numbers must first be ordered from least to greatest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

*   **Odd Number of Data Points:** If there's an odd number of values, the median is the single number exactly in the middle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
    *   *Example:* For the data set (0, 7, 50, 10,000, 1,000,000), the ordered set is the same. There are five numbers, so the median is 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   **Even Number of Data Points:** If there's an even number of values, there are two middle numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. In this case, the median is the [[mean_or_central_tendency_in_statistics | arithmetic mean]] (or halfway point) of these two middle numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
    *   *Example:* For the ordered plant heights (1, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>, the two middle numbers are 3 and 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. The median is (3 + 4) / 2 = 3.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

### Mode
The mode is the most common number in a data set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. If all numbers appear with equal frequency, there is no mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. It is considered the most basic idea among the [[measures_of_central_tendency | measures of central tendency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

**Example:**
For the plant heights data set (4, 3, 1, 6, 1, 7) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>, the number '1' appears twice, while all other numbers appear only once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Therefore, the mode is 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

These [[measures_of_central_tendency | measures of central tendency]] — [[mean_or_central_tendency_in_statistics | arithmetic mean]], median, and mode — are distinct ways of representing a typical, middle, or central value of a data set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Each is useful in different contexts, with the median being particularly valuable when a data set contains extreme values that could skew the [[mean_or_central_tendency_in_statistics | arithmetic mean]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

[[Introduction to statistics|Statistics]] is fundamentally a method to comprehend and manage data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. When beginning to explore statistics, the initial focus is often on [[Descriptive statistics|descriptive statistics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This involves taking a large amount of data and summarizing it with a smaller set of numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Once a toolkit for descriptive statistics is built, it allows for making inferences and judgments about the data, leading into [[Introduction to inferential statistics|inferential statistics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Describing Data

The core challenge in descriptive statistics is to describe a data set succinctly. For instance, if you have six plants with heights of 4, 3, 1, 6, 1, and 7 inches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, and someone asks for a single number to represent all these heights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, you'd be looking for a typical, middle, or most frequent number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This is the goal of finding an "average" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

### Measures of Central Tendency

In statistics, the term "average" is more general than its everyday usage, which typically refers to the arithmetic [[mean_and_central_tendency|mean]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Statistically, "average" broadly means a typical or middle number, and it represents an attempt to find a [[measures_of_central_tendency|measure of central tendency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. There are several types of averages:

#### Arithmetic Mean

The arithmetic mean is the most commonly understood form of average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. It is defined as the sum of all numbers in a data set divided by the total count of numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. This definition is a human-constructed tool that has proven useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

For the plant heights (4, 3, 1, 6, 1, 7 inches) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>:
$$
\frac{4 + 3 + 1 + 6 + 1 + 7}{6} = \frac{22}{6} = 3 \frac{2}{3} \approx 3.66\overline{6}
$$
The arithmetic mean for this data set is 3 and 2/3, or approximately 3.6 repeating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

#### Median

The median is the literal middle number in a data set once all numbers are ordered from least to greatest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

For the plant heights (4, 3, 1, 6, 1, 7), first, order them: (1, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
Since there is an even number of data points (six), there are two middle numbers: 3 and 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. In this case, the median is calculated by finding the [[mean_and_central_tendency|arithmetic mean]] of these two middle numbers, which is halfway between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
$$
\frac{3 + 4}{2} = 3.5
$$
The median for this data set is 3.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

If there is an odd number of data points, the median is simply the single middle number. For example, in the data set (0, 7, 50, 10,000, 1,000,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>, the median is 50, as it is the number with two values below it and two values above it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

#### Mode

The mode is the most common number in a data set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. If all numbers appear with equal frequency, there is no mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. While less frequently used in general, it is a straightforward concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

For the plant heights (4, 3, 1, 6, 1, 7) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>:
The number 1 appears twice, while all other numbers (3, 4, 6, 7) appear only once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Therefore, the mode is 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

These different measures of [[central_tendency_and_averages|central tendency]] each provide a way to describe the "typical" value of a data set, serving different purposes depending on the data's characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. For instance, the median is particularly useful when a data set contains extreme values that might disproportionately "skew" the arithmetic mean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

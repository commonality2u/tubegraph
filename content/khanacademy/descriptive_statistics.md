[[descriptive_statistics | Descriptive statistics]] is a fundamental part of the journey into the world of [[introduction_to_statistics | statistics]], which is primarily concerned with understanding and making sense of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Purpose

The main goal of [[descriptive_statistics | descriptive statistics]] is to summarize and describe a large set of data using a smaller, more manageable set of numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This allows for a concise representation of the data without needing to present every single data point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Once a toolkit for [[descriptive_statistics | descriptive statistics]] is built, it can be used to make inferences and conclusions about the data through [[inferential_statistics | inferential statistics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Describing Data with a Single Number

When looking at a set of numbers, such as the heights of six plants (4, 3, 1, 6, 1, 7 inches), the challenge is to represent all these values with just one number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This single number should ideally be typical, represent the middle, be the most frequent, or indicate the center of all the numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This concept is formalized in [[measures_of_central_tendency | measures of central tendency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## [[measures_of_central_tendency | Measures of Central Tendency]]

[[measures_of_central_tendency | Measures of central tendency]] are attempts to find a "typical" or "middle" number that represents the center of a data set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. The term "average" in [[central_tendency_in_statistics | statistics]] is a more general concept that encompasses various types of these measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

### Arithmetic [[mean_in_statistics | Mean]]

The arithmetic [[mean_in_statistics | mean]] is the most commonly understood "average" in everyday language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

*   **Definition**: It is calculated by summing all the numbers in a data set and dividing by the count of numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. This is a human-constructed definition found to be useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Example Calculation**: For the plant heights (4, 3, 1, 6, 1, 7):
    *   Sum = 4 + 3 + 1 + 6 + 1 + 7 = 22 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
    *   Number of data points = 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
    *   Arithmetic [[mean_in_statistics | mean]] = 22 / 6 = 3 and 4/6 = 3 and 2/3 (or approximately 3.6 repeating) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   **Usage**: The arithmetic [[mean_in_statistics | mean]] is used very frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

### Median

The median literally represents the middle number in a data set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

*   **Definition**: To find the median, the numbers must first be ordered from least to greatest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   **Example Calculation (Even Number of Data Points)**: For the ordered plant heights (1, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7):
    *   Since there are six numbers (an even count), there are two middle numbers: 3 and 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
    *   The median is the arithmetic [[mean_in_statistics | mean]] (or halfway point) between these two middle numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
    *   Median = (3 + 4) / 2 = 3.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   **Example Calculation (Odd Number of Data Points)**: For an ordered data set like (0, 7, 50, 10,000, 1,000,000):
    *   There are five numbers (an odd count) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
    *   The median is the exact middle number, which is 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
*   **Usage**: The median is particularly useful when there are extreme values (outliers) that might "skew" the arithmetic [[mean_in_statistics | mean]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

### Mode

The mode is the most common number in a data set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

*   **Definition**: It represents the value that appears most frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. If all numbers appear with the same frequency, there is no mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
*   **Example Calculation**: For the plant heights (4, 3, 1, 6, 1, 7):
    *   The number 1 appears twice, while all other numbers (3, 4, 6, 7) appear only once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
    *   Therefore, the mode is 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   **Usage**: The mode can be useful, especially when a particular number appears much more frequently than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

While these [[central_tendency_measures | measures of central tendency]] all aim to describe the typical or central value of a data set, they do so in different ways and are suitable for different situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

Probability is a fundamental concept used to measure the likelihood of an event occurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. It is generally calculated by determining the ratio of outcomes that meet specific constraints to the total number of [[mapping_outcomes_of_random_processes | possible outcomes]] from a given [[trial_and_event_in_probability | trial]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Defining the Sample Space

The "sample space" refers to the set of all [[mapping_outcomes_of_random_processes | possible outcomes]] in a particular [[trial_and_event_in_probability | trial]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

Consider the example of pulling a marble from a bag containing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>:
*   3 yellow marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>
*   2 red marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   2 green marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>
*   1 blue marble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>

In this scenario, the act of "picking a marble out of a bag" is considered a [[trial_and_event_in_probability | trial]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

The [[mapping_outcomes_of_random_processes | possible outcomes]] for this [[trial_and_event_in_probability | trial]] are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>:
*   Yellow 1, Yellow 2, Yellow 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>
*   Red 1, Red 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>
*   Green 1, Green 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>
*   Blue 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>

The total number of [[mapping_outcomes_of_random_processes | possible outcomes]] is 8 (3 + 2 + 2 + 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. This total represents the size of the sample space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Calculating Probability

To [[calculating_probabilities_for_specific_outcomes | calculate the probability]] of a specific [[trial_and_event_in_probability | event]], such as pulling a yellow marble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, follow these steps:

1.  **Identify the total number of [[mapping_outcomes_of_random_processes | possible outcomes]] (the size of the sample space)**: In this example, there are 8 marbles, so 8 [[mapping_outcomes_of_random_processes | possible outcomes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
2.  **Identify the number of outcomes that satisfy the desired [[trial_and_event_in_probability | event]]**: For picking a yellow marble, there are 3 yellow marbles that meet this condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

The probability is then the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of [[mapping_outcomes_of_random_processes | possible outcomes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>:

$$P(\text{picking yellow}) = \frac{\text{Number of yellow marbles}}{\text{Total number of marbles}} = \frac{3}{8}$$

This straightforward method allows for the [[quantifying_outcomes_for_probability | quantification of outcomes]] to determine the likelihood of an [[trial_and_event_in_probability | event]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

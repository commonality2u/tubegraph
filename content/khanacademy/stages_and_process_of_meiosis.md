[[overview_of_meiosis | Meiosis]] is a specialized type of cell division that occurs in germ cells to produce [[gametes]] (sex cells) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. This process facilitates [[role_of_meiosis_in_sexual_reproduction | sexual reproduction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a> and involves two distinct rounds of division: Meiosis I and Meiosis II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. Starting with a diploid cell, meiosis ultimately yields four haploid cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

## Comparison with Mitosis

While both [[overview_of_mitosis_and_meiosis | mitosis and meiosis]] are forms of cell division, they have distinct outcomes and functions:
*   **[[overview_of_mitosis | Mitosis]]**: Starts with a diploid cell and produces two diploid cells, essentially duplicating the original cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. It occurs in somatic cells, such as skin, hair, and other body tissues, for growth and repair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>.
*   **Meiosis**: Starts with a diploid germ cell and produces four haploid gametes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. The chromosome number is halved, which is a key [[differences_between_mitosis_and_meiosis | difference]] from mitosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.
*   **Shared Phases**: Both processes involve similar phases: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>. In meiosis, these phases occur twice (e.g., Prophase I and Prophase II) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>.

## Pre-Meiosis: Interphase

Before meiosis begins, the cell spends most of its time in [[interphase]], carrying out normal cellular functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. A critical event during the S phase of interphase is [[dna_replication_process | DNA replication]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>:
*   Each chromosome replicates, forming two identical sister chromatids connected at a centromere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>.
*   Homologous pairs (chromosomes coding for the same genes, one from each parent) exist, and each chromosome within these pairs replicates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.
*   Centrosomes also replicate, resulting in two centrosomes in the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.
*   Chromosomes are unwound as chromatin during interphase but are drawn in their condensed form for clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.

## Meiosis I

Meiosis I is the first round of division, characterized by the separation of homologous chromosomes.

### Prophase I
*   The nuclear envelope begins to disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>.
*   Chromatin condenses into visible chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:00">[12:36:00]</a>.
*   Centrosomes migrate to opposite poles of the cell and begin forming spindle fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>.
*   **Key Event: Synapsis and Crossing Over**: Homologous chromosomes pair up and align side-by-side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>. This paired structure (tetrad) allows for [[genetic_variation_through_meiotic_processes | genetic recombination]] through "crossing over," where segments of non-sister chromatids are exchanged at points called chiasmata <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:00">[11:59:00]</a>. This process generates significant [[genetic_variation_through_meiotic_processes | variation]] in the offspring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>.

### Metaphase I
*   The nuclear envelope is fully gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>.
*   Homologous chromosome pairs (tetrads) align at the metaphase plate (the cell's equator) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:00">[15:05:00]</a>.
*   Spindle fibers from opposite poles attach to the kinetochores (protein structures) on one side of each homologous chromosome's centromere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:00">[13:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:46:00">[14:46:00]</a>. The orientation of each homologous pair at the metaphase plate is random, further contributing to genetic variation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:00">[14:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20:00">[14:20:00]</a>.

### Anaphase I
*   Homologous chromosomes separate and are pulled to opposite poles of the cell by the shortening spindle fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:08:00">[15:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22:00">[15:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01:00">[16:01:00]</a>.
*   Crucially, the sister chromatids *remain attached* at their centromeres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:13:00">[15:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:28:00">[15:28:00]</a>. This differs from mitosis, where sister chromatids separate in anaphase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:13:00">[15:13:00]</a>.

### Telophase I and Cytokinesis I
*   The separated homologous chromosomes arrive at opposite poles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:48:00">[16:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:05:00">[17:05:00]</a>.
*   The nuclear envelope may begin to reform around each set of chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:42:00">[17:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:50:00">[17:50:00]</a>.
*   Spindle fibers disassemble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:15:00">[17:15:00]</a>.
*   [[Cytokinesis]] (the division of the cytoplasm) occurs, forming two haploid daughter cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:29:00">[17:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:52:00">[17:52:00]</a>. Each daughter cell now has half the number of chromosomes as the original diploid cell, but each chromosome still consists of two sister chromatids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:02:00">[18:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:09:00">[18:09:00]</a>.

## Meiosis II

Meiosis II is very similar to mitosis. It separates the sister chromatids within each of the two haploid cells formed during Meiosis I. Sometimes, an [[interphase]] II or "interkinesis" occurs, where centrosomes duplicate again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:32:00">[18:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:37:00">[18:37:00]</a>.

### Prophase II
*   The nuclear envelope (if reformed) disintegrates again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:53:00">[19:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:57:00">[19:57:00]</a>.
*   Centrosomes move to opposite poles and new spindle fibers form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:10:00">[20:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:17:00">[20:17:00]</a>. This happens simultaneously in both daughter cells from Meiosis I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:20:00">[20:20:00]</a>.

### Metaphase II
*   Chromosomes (each still composed of two sister chromatids) align individually at the metaphase plate in each of the two cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:42:00">[20:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:45:00">[20:45:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:31:00">[21:31:00]</a>.
*   Spindle fibers from opposite poles attach to the kinetochores on *both sides* of each centromere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:58:00">[21:58:00]</a>.

### Anaphase II
*   Sister chromatids finally separate at the centromere and are pulled to opposite poles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:17:00">[22:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:48:00">[22:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:51:00">[22:51:00]</a>.
*   Once separated, each chromatid is now considered an individual chromosome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:43:00">[23:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:49:00">[23:49:00]</a>.

### Telophase II and Cytokinesis II
*   The separated chromosomes arrive at the poles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:51:00">[24:51:00]</a>.
*   The nuclear envelope reforms around each set of chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:15:00">[25:15:00]</a>.
*   Spindle fibers disintegrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:13:00">[25:13:00]</a>.
*   [[Cytokinesis]] occurs, dividing each of the two cells from Meiosis I into two new cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:02:00">[25:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:11:00">[25:11:00]</a>.

## Outcome of Meiosis

The end result of meiosis is four genetically unique haploid cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. These are the gametes (sperm or egg cells) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. The processes of crossing over in Prophase I and the random alignment of homologous pairs in Metaphase I are crucial for introducing [[genetic_variation_through_meiotic_processes | genetic variation]] within a species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:20:00">[18:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:56:00">[26:56:00]</a>.

Ratios are mathematical [[understanding_ratios | expressions]] that compare quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. They indicate how many of one item exists for a certain number of another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. A ratio does not always represent the literal count of items, but rather the proportional relationship between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Ways to Express Ratios

Ratios can be expressed in several equivalent forms:

1.  **Using a colon (A:B)**: This is a common notation. For example, if there are 10 horses and 5 dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, the ratio of horses to dogs is 10:5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
2.  **As a fraction (A/B)**: The ratio can also be written as a fraction. Using the same example, the ratio of horses to dogs is 10/5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
3.  **Using the word "to" (A to B)**: Another way to express the ratio is by writing out the word "to". So, the ratio of horses to dogs is 10 to 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

All these forms convey the same comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The quantity mentioned first corresponds to the first number in the ratio (or the numerator in fraction form), and the second quantity corresponds to the second number (or the denominator) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

### The Importance of Order

The order in which quantities are stated is crucial when expressing a ratio. For instance, the ratio of horses to dogs (10:5) is different from the ratio of dogs to horses (5:10) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. The ratio must reflect the specific order requested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

> For example, if you have 5 dogs and 10 horses:
> *   Ratio of horses to dogs: 10:5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>
> *   Ratio of dogs to horses: 5:10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>

## [[reducing_ratios_to_simplest_form | Reducing Ratios to Simplest Form]]

Ratios can often be simplified or "reduced" to their simplest form, similar to fractions. To do this, find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numbers in the ratio and divide each number by it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. This provides an [[understanding_equivalent_expressions_in_algebra | equivalent expression]] that is easier to interpret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

> For the ratio of 10 horses to 5 dogs (10:5):
> *   The greatest common divisor of 10 and 5 is 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
> *   Divide both numbers by 5:
>     *   10 ÷ 5 = 2
>     *   5 ÷ 5 = 1
> *   The simplified ratio is 2:1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, meaning there are 2 horses for every 1 dog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## [[calculating_ratios_with_multiple_items | Ratios with Multiple Items]]

Ratios are not limited to comparing only two quantities; they can compare three or more items simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. The principle remains the same: the order of the quantities in the ratio must match the order in which they are presented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. To simplify, find the greatest common divisor for all numbers in the ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

> Example: 20 apples, 40 oranges, 60 strawberries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
> *   The ratio of apples to oranges to strawberries is 20:40:60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
> *   The greatest common divisor of 20, 40, and 60 is 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
> *   Divide each number by 20:
>     *   20 ÷ 20 = 1
>     *   40 ÷ 20 = 2
>     *   60 ÷ 20 = 3
> *   The simplified ratio is 1:2:3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. This means for every 1 apple, there are 2 oranges and 3 strawberries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

## [[finding_quantities_from_given_ratios | Finding Quantities from Ratios]]

If you know a ratio and the total quantity of items, you can determine the specific count of each item.

> Example: The ratio of boys to girls in a classroom is 2:3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, and there are 40 students total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. To find how many girls there are:
1.  **Sum the ratio parts**: 2 (boys) + 3 (girls) = 5 total parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. This means for every 5 students, there are 2 boys and 3 girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
2.  **Calculate the number of groups**: Divide the total number of students by the sum of the ratio parts: 40 students ÷ 5 students/group = 8 groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.
3.  **Multiply by the relevant ratio part**: Since each group has 3 girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>, multiply the number of groups by the girls' ratio part: 8 groups × 3 girls/group = 24 girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
    *   Similarly, for boys: 8 groups × 2 boys/group = 16 boys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. (Total students 40 - 24 girls = 16 boys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>).

This method extends to ratios with more than two items.

> Example: Ratio of sheep to chickens to pigs is 2:5:10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, with a total of 51 animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. To find how many chickens:
1.  **Sum the ratio parts**: 2 + 5 + 10 = 17 total parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. For every 17 animals, there are 2 sheep, 5 chickens, and 10 pigs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.
2.  **Calculate the number of groups**: 51 animals ÷ 17 animals/group = 3 groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.
3.  **Multiply for chickens**: Each group has 5 chickens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. So, 3 groups × 5 chickens/group = 15 chickens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.

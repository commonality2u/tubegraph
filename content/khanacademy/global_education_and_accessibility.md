[[Khan Academy and online education | Khan Academy]] is widely recognized for its extensive collection of educational videos, covering subjects from basic arithmetic to vector calculus and various other disciplines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The platform currently serves millions of students monthly, with hundreds of thousands of videos watched daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Origins and Early Impact on Accessibility
The inception of [[Khan Academy and online education | Khan Academy]] began about five years prior to this discussion, when Salman Khan, then a hedge fund analyst, started tutoring his cousins in New Orleans remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. He began uploading these tutoring sessions to YouTube as a supplementary resource for his cousins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

A surprising preference emerged: his cousins preferred the YouTube videos to in-person tutoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. This preference highlighted key advantages for learners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>:
*   **Self-Paced Learning**: Students could pause and repeat explanations without feeling they were wasting the tutor's time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Reduced Embarrassment**: Learners could review foundational concepts, even if they should have learned them years ago, without embarrassment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **Privacy**: Learning new concepts could be done in the "intimacy of their own room," removing the pressure of immediate comprehension checks from another human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

Khan also noted that making the videos public on YouTube led to unexpected positive feedback from random people globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. This feedback included comments like "First time I smiled doing a derivative" and "I actually got a natural high and a good mood for the entire day" after understanding complex topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Letters also revealed the profound impact on students, including a 12-year-old with autism who struggled with math but "got through" concepts like decimals and fractions using the videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. This demonstrated that the platform was more than just a "nice to have" resource; it was genuinely helping people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

## Flipped Classroom and Humanization of Education
[[Khan Academy and online education | Khan Academy]] videos also found their way into traditional classrooms, leading to the "flipped classroom" model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Teachers began assigning video lectures for homework and utilizing class time for problem-solving and interactive work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

This approach uses technology to "humanize the classroom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. By removing the "one size fits all" lecture, students can engage with material at their own pace at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. In class, teachers can walk around, and students can interact with each other and receive personalized attention, transforming a potentially "dehumanizing experience" into a more interactive and human one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. This shift increases the "student to valuable human time with the teacher" ratio significantly, from possibly 5% to 100% of the teacher's time focused on direct student interaction rather than lecturing or grading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

## Mastery-Based Learning and Global Reach
[[Khan Academy and online education | Khan Academy]]'s model emphasizes mastery-based learning, where students must achieve proficiency (e.g., 10 correct answers in a row) before moving on to the next concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. This contrasts with traditional models where students might pass an exam with 70% or 80% and move on, leaving "Swiss cheese gaps" in their foundational knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. The platform encourages experimentation and failure on the path to mastery, rather than penalizing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. This approach makes learning more accessible and effective for all students, ensuring that knowledge gaps do not accumulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

The platform provides a "knowledge map" where concepts are interconnected, starting from basic addition and progressing to advanced topics like algebra, calculus, logic, computer programming, grammar, and genetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. This structured path ensures that learning builds progressively, making complex subjects accessible by reinforcing prerequisites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

Pilots in school districts, like Los Altos, have shown the efficacy of this model, where students use [[Khan Academy and online education | Khan Academy]] software for half their math class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. Teachers use dashboards to monitor student progress, identifying those who are proficient (green), working on concepts (blue), or stuck (red) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. This [[datadriven_insights_in_education | data-driven insight]] allows teachers to intervene precisely where needed or have proficient students tutor their peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. The data provides granular detail, showing which problems students got right or wrong, how long they spent, and their focus areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

A significant finding from self-paced learning is the challenge to traditional labels of "gifted" or "slow" students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. When allowed to work at their own pace, students who initially take longer often "race ahead" once they master a concept, demonstrating the [[universality_of_learning_capability | learning capability]] across all students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

## Vision for Global Accessibility
The ultimate goal of [[Khan Academy and online education | Khan Academy]] is to humanize education globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. The benefits extend beyond traditional classrooms to:
*   **Adult Learners**: Individuals embarrassed to revisit foundational knowledge before returning to college can do so privately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.
*   **Underprivileged Students**: A "street kid in Calcutta" who needs to help their family during the day can now access education for a few hours daily, without embarrassment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.

The platform envisions a system where peer-to-peer tutoring extends beyond the classroom, enabling students from different parts of the world to help each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. This leads to the concept of a "global one world classroom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

### Motivation and Engagement
To further [[the_journey_of_learning | engage learners]], [[Khan Academy and online education | Khan Academy]] incorporates game mechanics such as badges, energy points, and leaderboards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. The wording of badges or points awarded can significantly influence student behavior, guiding tens of thousands of students in certain directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

The platform is freely accessible and ready for widespread adoption in classrooms, with millions of users already utilizing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>. Coaches, including parents or mentors, can log in and use the dashboards to monitor and support learners, embodying the immediate accessibility of tutoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.

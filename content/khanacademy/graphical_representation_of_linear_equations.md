When [[solving_simple_linear_equations | solving linear equations]], a helpful approach involves visualizing the equation as a balanced state. This method, while not involving traditional coordinate plane graphing, provides a tangible [[visualization_techniques_in_solving_equations | visualization technique]] for understanding the operations required to find the unknown variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. The core principle is that an equation represents an equality, meaning both sides are equivalent; thus, any operation performed on one side must also be performed on the other to maintain this balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:29">[01:38:29]</a>.

## Solving an Equation Visually: Example 1 (3x + 5 = 17)

Consider the equation `3x + 5 = 17` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

1.  **Representing the Equation**:
    *   The term `3x` can be thought of as three separate 'x' objects (<span style="color:red;">x</span> + <span style="color:red;">x</span> + <span style="color:red;">x</span>) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.
    *   The `+ 5` can be represented as five individual '1' objects (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.
    *   These are balanced against `17` individual '1' objects on the other side of the equation (1, 2, ..., 17) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.

2.  **Isolating the Variable Term (3x)**:
    *   To get `3x` by itself on the left side, the `+ 5` needs to be removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.
    *   This is achieved by conceptually or physically removing five '1' objects from the left side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.
    *   To maintain equality, five '1' objects must also be removed from the right side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.
    *   Symbolically, this corresponds to subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation:
        `3x + 5 - 5 = 17 - 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>
        `3x = 12` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.
    *   Visually, after removing the objects, twelve '1' objects remain on the right side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.

3.  **Solving for the Variable (x)**:
    *   The equation is now `3x = 12` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. To find the value of a single `x`, divide both sides by 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>.
    *   Visually, this means dividing the three 'x' objects into three groups, each containing one 'x' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>.
    *   Similarly, divide the twelve '1' objects on the right side into three equal groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. Each group will contain four '1' objects (12 / 3 = 4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>.
    *   Symbolically:
        `3x / 3 = 12 / 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>
        `x = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.
    *   This visual representation clearly shows that one 'x' object is equivalent to four '1' objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.

## Solving an Equation Symbolically: Example 2 (7x - 2 = -10)

While the visual drawing is helpful for understanding, [[solving_simple_linear_equations | solving linear equations]] is typically done symbolically. The same principles of balance apply, even with negative numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.

Consider the equation `7x - 2 = -10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>.

1.  **Eliminate the Constant Term**:
    *   To isolate the `7x` term, add 2 to both sides of the equation to cancel out the `- 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>.
    *   `7x - 2 + 2 = -10 + 2`
    *   On the left side, `-2 + 2` equals 0, leaving `7x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>.
    *   On the right side, `-10 + 2` moves two units to the right on a number line from -10, resulting in -8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>.
    *   The equation becomes: `7x = -8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>.

2.  **Solve for x**:
    *   To find `x`, divide both sides by 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>.
    *   `7x / 7 = -8 / 7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>
    *   `x = -8/7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>.
    *   This can also be expressed as a mixed number: `x = -1 and 1/7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>.

Both methods, visual and symbolic, demonstrate how applying inverse operations equally to both sides of an equation maintains its balance and allows for the isolation of the variable.

Simplifying rational expressions is similar to [[simplifying_fractions | simplifying fractions]] or rational numbers by putting them in their "lowest terms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The core idea involves identifying and canceling out [[common_factors_in_rational_expressions | common factors]] between the numerator and the denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Analogy to Rational Numbers

When simplifying a fraction like 3/6, we recognize that 3 and 6 share a [[common_factors_in_rational_expressions | common factor]] of 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.
*   The numerator (3) is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
*   The denominator (6) can be written as 2 multiplied by 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
Since 3 is a [[common_factors_in_rational_expressions | common factor]], it can be canceled out (e.g., by dividing both numerator and denominator by 3), resulting in 1/2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

Similarly, for 8/24, both 8 and 24 share a [[common_factors_in_rational_expressions | common factor]] of 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This can be expressed as (1 * 8) / (3 * 8), which simplifies to 1/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Understanding Rational Expressions

Rational expressions are fundamentally the same concept as rational numbers, but their numerators and denominators are [[understanding_algebraic_expressions | expressions involving variables]] instead of just numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Step-by-Step Simplification Examples

The process of simplifying rational expressions involves factoring the numerator and the denominator to identify and cancel [[common_factors_in_rational_expressions | common factors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

### Example 1: Factoring out a Constant

Consider the expression: (9x + 3) / (12x + 4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>
1.  **Factor the numerator**: Factor out the greatest common factor, which is 3.
    9x + 3 = 3(3x + 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>
2.  **Factor the denominator**: Factor out the greatest common factor, which is 4.
    12x + 4 = 4(3x + 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>
3.  **Identify and cancel common factors**: Both numerator and denominator have the [[common_factors_in_rational_expressions | common factor]] (3x + 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
    [3(3x + 1)] / [4(3x + 1)]
    After cancellation, the expression simplifies to 3/4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### Example 2: Factoring a Difference of Squares

Consider the expression: (x² - 9) / (5x + 15) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>
1.  **Factor the numerator**: This is a difference of squares (a² - b² = (a - b)(a + b)).
    x² - 9 = (x + 3)(x - 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>
2.  **Factor the denominator**: Factor out the greatest common factor, which is 5.
    5x + 15 = 5(x + 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>
3.  **Identify and cancel common factors**: Both have the [[common_factors_in_rational_expressions | common factor]] (x + 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
    [(x + 3)(x - 3)] / [5(x + 3)]
    After cancellation, the expression simplifies to (x - 3) / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

### Example 3: Factoring Quadratic Trinomials

Consider the expression: (x² + 6x + 5) / (x² - x - 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>
1.  **Factor the numerator**: Find two numbers that multiply to 5 and add to 6 (which are 5 and 1).
    x² + 6x + 5 = (x + 5)(x + 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>
2.  **Factor the denominator**: Find two numbers that multiply to -2 and add to -1 (which are -2 and 1).
    x² - x - 2 = (x - 2)(x + 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>
3.  **Identify and cancel common factors**: Both have the [[common_factors_in_rational_expressions | common factor]] (x + 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
    [(x + 5)(x + 1)] / [(x - 2)(x + 1)]
    After cancellation, the expression simplifies to (x + 5) / (x - 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

### Example 4: Factoring by Grouping

Consider the expression: (3x² + 3x - 18) / (2x² + 5x - 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>

#### Factoring the Numerator (3x² + 3x - 18)
1.  Find two numbers that multiply to (3 * -18 = -54) and add to 3 (which are 9 and -6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
2.  Rewrite the middle term using these numbers: 3x² + 9x - 6x - 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
3.  Group terms and factor out common factors:
    *   3x(x + 3) from (3x² + 9x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>
    *   -6(x + 3) from (-6x - 18) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>
4.  Factor out the common binomial factor: (3x - 6)(x + 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

#### Factoring the Denominator (2x² + 5x - 3)
1.  Find two numbers that multiply to (2 * -3 = -6) and add to 5 (which are 6 and -1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.
2.  Rewrite the middle term: 2x² + 6x - x - 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.
3.  Group terms and factor out common factors:
    *   2x(x + 3) from (2x² + 6x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>
    *   -1(x + 3) from (-x - 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>
4.  Factor out the common binomial factor: (2x - 1)(x + 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

#### Final Simplification
The original expression becomes: [(3x - 6)(x + 3)] / [(2x - 1)(x + 3)] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>
Identify and cancel the [[common_factors_in_rational_expressions | common factor]] (x + 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.
The simplified expression is (3x - 6) / (2x - 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

## Important Condition: Excluded Values

When simplifying rational expressions, it is crucial to note any values of the variable that would have made the *original* denominator equal to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. Even after simplification, the domain of the simplified expression must match the domain of the original expression.

*   For (x² - 9) / (5x + 15) which simplifies to (x - 3) / 5:
    The original denominator, 5(x + 3), would be zero if x = -3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Therefore, the simplified expression is (x - 3) / 5, provided that x ≠ -3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. The simplified form alone is defined at x = -3, but the original expression is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

*   For (x² + 6x + 5) / (x² - x - 2) which simplifies to (x + 5) / (x - 2):
    The original denominator, (x - 2)(x + 1), would be zero if x = 2 or x = -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. Thus, the simplified expression is (x + 5) / (x - 2), provided that x ≠ -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a> (as the (x-2) factor remains in the denominator). The simplified form (x+5)/(x-2) is defined at x = -1, but the original expression is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

*   For (3x² + 3x - 18) / (2x² + 5x - 3) which simplifies to (3x - 6) / (2x - 1):
    The original denominator, (2x - 1)(x + 3), would be zero if x = 1/2 or x = -3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. Therefore, the simplified expression is (3x - 6) / (2x - 1), provided that x ≠ -3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

This condition is especially important when [[graphing_rational_expressions | graphing rational expressions]], as excluded values correspond to "holes" in the graph rather than vertical asymptotes, if the factor cancels out completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

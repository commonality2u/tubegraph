A quadratic function, such as `f(x) = 3x^2 + 6x - 2`, has a distinctive parabolic shape when graphed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. Understanding its graph helps in determining its [[domain_of_a_quadratic_function | domain]] and [[range_of_a_quadratic_function | range]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.

## Determining the Domain

The [[domain_of_a_quadratic_function | domain]] of a function is the set of all valid inputs, or x-values, for which the function is defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. For a [[quadratic polynomials | quadratic function]] like `f(x) = 3x^2 + 6x - 2`, you can take any real number, square it, multiply it by 3, add 6 times that number, and then subtract 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Therefore, the [[domain_of_a_quadratic_function | domain]] for this function is all real numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Most traditional numbers are part of the set of real numbers, which includes everything except complex numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.

## Determining the Range

The [[range_of_a_quadratic_function | range]] is the set of all possible outputs (y-values) that the function can produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. For a parabola, the [[range_of_a_quadratic_function | range]] is limited by its vertex.
*   If the parabola opens upward, it will not take on any values below its vertex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.
*   If it opens downward, it will not take on any values above its vertex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

### Finding the Vertex

The vertex is a critical point for determining the [[range_of_a_quadratic_function | range]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. For a quadratic function in the form `ax^2 + bx + c`, the x-coordinate of the vertex can be calculated using the formula `-b / 2a` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. This formula is derived directly from the [[introduction_to_the_quadratic_formula | quadratic formula]], which itself comes from completing the square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

For `f(x) = 3x^2 + 6x - 2`:
*   `a = 3` and `b = 6`
*   x-coordinate of vertex = `-6 / (2 * 3)` = `-6 / 6` = `-1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>

To find the y-coordinate of the vertex, substitute x = -1 back into the function:
`f(-1) = 3(-1)^2 + 6(-1) - 2`
`f(-1) = 3(1) - 6 - 2`
`f(-1) = 3 - 6 - 2`
`f(-1) = -3 - 2`
`f(-1) = -5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>

So, the vertex of `f(x) = 3x^2 + 6x - 2` is at `(-1, -5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.

Since the coefficient `a` (which is 3) is positive, the parabola opens upward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. This means the vertex represents the minimum point of the function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>. The function can get as low as -5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>, but never less than -5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>. As x values increase or decrease from the vertex, the parabola goes upwards, meaning the y-values increase indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>.

Therefore, the [[range_of_a_quadratic_function | range]] is all real numbers greater than or equal to -5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>.

## Plotting Points and Graphing

To visualize the function, plot several points, including the vertex, and observe the symmetry:

| x | f(x) | Coordinates |
|---|------|-------------|
| -2 | 3(-2)^2 + 6(-2) - 2 = 12 - 12 - 2 = -2 | (-2, -2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a> |
| -1 | -5 | (-1, -5) (Vertex) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a> |
| 0 | 3(0)^2 + 6(0) - 2 = -2 | (0, -2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a> |
| 1 | 3(1)^2 + 6(1) - 2 = 3 + 6 - 2 = 7 | (1, 7) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a> |

Plotting these points helps to create a scaffold for the parabola:
*   (-2, -2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>
*   (-1, -5) (Vertex) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>
*   (0, -2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>
*   (1, 7) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>

The graph will look like an upward-opening curve, extending infinitely upwards from the vertex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>.

## Symmetry of the Parabola

A key characteristic of a parabola is its symmetry around the vertical line passing through its vertex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>. If you were to draw a vertical line through the vertex (in this case, at x = -1), the two sides of the parabola would be mirror images of each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>. This symmetry is evident in the plotted points: when x is one unit below the vertex (x=-2), `f(x)` is -2, and when x is one unit above the vertex (x=0), `f(x)` is also -2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. This confirms that (-1, -5) is indeed the vertex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>.

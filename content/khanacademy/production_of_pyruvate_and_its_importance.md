[[overview_of_glycolysis | Glycolysis]], which literally means the breaking down of glucose, is the first phase of cellular respiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This process culminates in the production of pyruvate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.

## The Process of Pyruvate Production

The journey to pyruvate begins with glucose, a six-carbon molecule with the formula C6H12O6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. [[overview_of_glycolysis | Glycolysis]] is conceptually divided into two key phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>:

1.  **Investment Phase**
    The initial stage requires an "investment" of two [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATPs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>. This investment is used to break down the glucose molecule into two three-carbon compounds, often referred to as PGAL or phosphoglyceraldehyde <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>. These compounds also acquire phosphate groups from the [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATPs]] used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.

2.  **Payoff Phase**
    Each of the two PGAL molecules then enters the payoff phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. During this phase, each PGAL is converted into pyruvate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. This transformation generates two [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATPs]] and one [[role_of_nad_and_nadh_in_glycolysis | NADH]] per PGAL molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>. Since there are two PGAL molecules, the payoff phase yields a total of four [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATPs]] and two [[role_of_nad_and_nadh_in_glycolysis | NADHs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:00">[12:18:00]</a>.

### Overall Equation and Net Yield

The [[overall_equation_and_net_energy_yield_of_glycolysis | overall equation]] for [[overview_of_glycolysis | glycolysis]] starts with glucose, two NAD+ molecules, two [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATPs]] (used as investment), and four ADPs (to be converted to [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATPs]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>. The products are:
*   **Two molecules of pyruvate** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>
*   **Two [[role_of_nad_and_nadh_in_glycolysis | NADHs]]** (from the reduction of NAD+) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>
*   **A net yield of two [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATPs]]** (four produced, minus two invested) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>

Pyruvate itself is a reconfigured three-carbon compound, also known as pyruvic acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. By the end of [[overview_of_glycolysis | glycolysis]], the six-carbon glucose molecule has been split in half and oxidized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:52:00">[12:52:00]</a>.

## Importance of Pyruvate

Pyruvate stands as a crucial intermediate in cellular metabolism, determining the subsequent pathways for energy generation:

*   **Aerobic Respiration:** If oxygen is available, pyruvate proceeds to the [[krebs_cycle_as_a_key_metabolic_pathway | Krebs cycle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. Before entering the [[krebs_cycle_as_a_key_metabolic_pathway | Krebs cycle]], pyruvate molecules are re-engineered into acetyl-CoAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59:00">[08:59:00]</a>. This pathway leads to the production of the bulk of [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATP]] through the electron transport chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.
*   **Anaerobic Respiration (Fermentation):** If oxygen is not present, pyruvate is shunted towards fermentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. In humans, this process produces lactic acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. In other organisms, fermentation might produce alcohol or ethanol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.

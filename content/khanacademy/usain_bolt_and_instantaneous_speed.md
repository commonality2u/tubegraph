Differential calculus is primarily concerned with the instantaneous rate of change of something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, a fundamental question that has captivated mathematicians and scientists throughout history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## The Founding Fathers of Calculus

Isaac Newton, a British mathematician and physicist, and Gottfried Leibniz, a German philosopher and mathematician, were contemporaries who together are considered the founding fathers of calculus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. They conducted most of their significant work in the late 1600s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Newton originally referred to differential calculus as the "method of fluxions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## The Core Question: How Fast Right Now?

The central question addressed by differential calculus is, "What is the instantaneous rate of change of something?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. For a sprinter like Usain Bolt, this translates to: "How fast is he going right now?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This differs from his average speed over a period of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, focusing instead on what is happening in a specific instant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### Visualizing Distance and Time

To understand this concept, we can plot [[concept_of_distance_and_displacement | distance]] (y-axis) as a function of [[examples_of_continuous_variables | time]] (x-axis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

At time zero, Usain Bolt has covered no distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Usain Bolt, as of early 2012, was the fastest human alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, capable of running 100 meters in 9.58 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Calculating Average Speed

To calculate Usain Bolt's [[understanding_speed_and_velocity | average speed]], we use the formula:

Average speed = change in [[concept_of_distance_and_displacement | distance]] / change in [[examples_of_continuous_variables | time]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

Using the graph variables:
Average speed = Δy / Δx <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>

This calculation represents the [[slope_and_its_relation_to_average_and_instantaneous_speed | slope]] of a line connecting the starting point (0 distance, 0 time) and the endpoint (100 meters, 9.58 seconds) on the distance-time graph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

*   Change in y (distance) = 100 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>
*   Change in x (time) = 9.58 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>

Average speed = 100 meters / 9.58 seconds ≈ 10.4 meters per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

To convert this to miles per hour:
*   10.4 m/s * 3600 s/hr = 37,440 meters per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>
*   37,440 m/hr / 1600 m/mile ≈ 23.4 miles per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>

## Instantaneous Speed vs. Average Speed

Usain Bolt does not maintain a constant speed throughout his race; he accelerates and decelerates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. A typical plot of his distance versus time would be a curve, starting with a shallower [[slope_and_its_relation_to_average_and_instantaneous_speed | slope]] (slower speed), then getting steeper as he accelerates, and possibly flattening slightly as he tires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

While the average speed is 23.5 mph, his peak [[understanding_speed_and_velocity | instantaneous velocity]] can be closer to 30 miles per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

## Calculus and the Instantaneous Rate of Change

Traditional algebra can approximate the [[slope_and_its_relation_to_average_and_instantaneous_speed | slope]] (rate of change) over a small interval (Δx) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. However, because the slope of a curve is constantly changing, this is only an approximation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

To find the true instantaneous rate of change, calculus employs the concept of a limit:
*   We need to determine what happens as the change in x (Δx) gets infinitesimally smaller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
*   This is expressed as the limit as Δx approaches 0 of Δy/Δx <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

This limit allows us to approach the exact instantaneous rate of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. It can be viewed as the [[slope_and_its_relation_to_average_and_instantaneous_speed | instantaneous slope]] at a single point on the curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>, or the [[tangent_line_and_instantaneous_slope | slope of the tangent line]] at that point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

In calculus terminology, this instantaneous slope is called the **derivative** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. The notation for the derivative is dy/dx <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Here, 'dy' and 'dx' are differentials, representing an infinitely small change in y and an infinitely small change in x, respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. By conceptualizing these super small changes, we can find the instantaneous speed of Usain Bolt at any given moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. It's important to note that you cannot simply substitute zero for Δx, as division by zero is undefined; instead, we rely on the concept of a limit approaching zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

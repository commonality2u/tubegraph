This article explores the concepts of supply and demand within the context of the apple market, illustrating how these forces interact to determine market prices and quantities.

## Graphing the Market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>

To analyze the apple market, a graph is used with the vertical axis representing the price per pound and the horizontal axis representing the quantity of apples in thousands of pounds per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Example price points are set from $1 to $5 per pound, and quantity tick marks range from 1,000 to 5,000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## The Demand Curve

The demand curve illustrates the relationship between the price of apples and the [[demand_schedule_and_its_significance | quantity demanded]] by consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

*   **High Price, Low Quantity Demanded:** If the price of apples is very high, consumers will demand less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. For example, at $5 per pound, the [[difference_between_quantity_demanded_and_demand | quantity demanded]] might be only 500 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Low Price, High Quantity Demanded:** If the price is low, consumers will demand more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. For instance, at $1 per pound, the [[difference_between_quantity_demanded_and_demand | quantity demanded]] could be 4,000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Demand vs. Quantity Demanded:** It is crucial to distinguish between "demand," which refers to the entire relationship shown by the curve, and "[[difference_between_quantity_demanded_and_demand | quantity demanded]]," which is the specific amount at a particular price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **Shape:** The resulting demand curve typically slopes downwards, reflecting the [[law_of_demand_in_microeconomics | law of demand]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## The Supply Curve

The supply curve illustrates the relationship between the price of apples and the quantity suppliers are willing to produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

*   **Low Price, Low Quantity Supplied:** Below a certain price, suppliers may not be willing to produce apples at all, such as 50 cents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. At $1 per pound, the quantity willing to be supplied might be around 1,000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **High Price, High Quantity Supplied:** As the price increases, suppliers are incentivized to produce more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Scope:** This analysis can apply to a specific supplier, a local market, or even the global market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **Shape:** The supply curve typically slopes upwards, indicating that as prices rise, so does the quantity supplied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## Market Scenarios

### Shortage Situation

If suppliers anticipate a low price and set it accordingly, a [[Market shortages and surpluses | shortage]] can occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

*   **Example:** If the initial price is set at $1 per pound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>:
    *   Quantity Supplied: 1,000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>
    *   Quantity Demanded: 4,000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>
*   **Result:** A [[Market shortages and surpluses | shortage]] of 3,000 pounds of apples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   **Market Adjustment:** In a [[Market shortages and surpluses | shortage]], consumers will bid up prices because there are not enough apples for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. This causes prices to rise, and producers respond by increasing the quantity supplied, moving along the supply curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

### Surplus Situation

Conversely, if suppliers set the price too high, a [[Market shortages and surpluses | surplus]] can occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

*   **Example:** If the price is set at $3 per pound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>:
    *   Quantity Supplied: 3,000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>
    *   Quantity Demanded: 1,300 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>
*   **Result:** A [[Market shortages and surpluses | surplus]] of 1,700 pounds of apples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   **Market Adjustment:** In a [[Market shortages and surpluses | surplus]], producers will reduce prices to sell their excess inventory, as apples do not last forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. This reduction in price causes the quantity supplied to decrease and the quantity demanded to increase, moving towards equilibrium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

## Market Equilibrium

Both [[Market shortages and surpluses | shortages]] and [[Market shortages and surpluses | surpluses]] naturally lead the market towards a point where the supply and demand curves intersect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

*   **Equilibrium Price:** This is the price at which the [[impact_of_price_changes_on_supply_and_demand | quantity supplied]] equals the [[impact_of_price_changes_on_supply_and_demand | quantity demanded]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. In the apple market example, this is approximately $2.15 per pound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
*   **Equilibrium Quantity:** This is the quantity at which the [[impact_of_price_changes_on_supply_and_demand | quantity supplied]] equals the [[impact_of_price_changes_on_supply_and_demand | quantity demanded]] at the equilibrium price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. For the apples, this is around 2,200 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

At equilibrium, the market is stable: all apples produced are sold, none go bad, and both consumers and producers are satisfied with the price and quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

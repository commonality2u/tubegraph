When solving [[introduction_to_algebra | algebraic equations]], the concept of equality is fundamental. An equation represents a balance between two sides, and to maintain this balance, any operation performed on one side must also be performed on the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Solving Equations by Maintaining Balance

Consider an equation like 3x + 5 = 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Unlike simpler equations where you might just have `3x = 17` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, the addition of '+ 5' complicates things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

To visualize this, `3x` means three instances of 'x' (x + x + x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, and this, combined with five individual objects (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>, equals seventeen individual objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

### Step-by-Step Solution: Example 1 (3x + 5 = 17)

1.  **Isolate the variable term:** The goal is to get the `3x` term by itself on one side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. To eliminate the '+ 5', subtract 5 from the left side. To keep the equation balanced, you must also subtract 5 from the right side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
    ```
    3x + 5 - 5 = 17 - 5
    ```
    On the left, `+5 - 5` cancels out, leaving `3x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. On the right, `17 - 5` equals 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
    This simplifies the equation to:
    ```
    3x = 12
    ```
    <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>

2.  **Solve for the variable:** Now, to isolate `x`, divide both sides of the equation by 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
    ```
    3x / 3 = 12 / 3
    ```
    On the left, `3x / 3` simplifies to `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. On the right, `12 / 3` equals 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
    Therefore, the solution is:
    ```
    x = 4
    ```
    <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>

### Step-by-Step Solution: Example 2 (7x - 2 = -10)

This example introduces negative numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>, but the principle of maintaining equality remains the same.

1.  **Isolate the variable term:** To eliminate the '- 2', add 2 to the left side. To maintain equality, also add 2 to the right side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
    ```
    7x - 2 + 2 = -10 + 2
    ```
    On the left, `-2 + 2` cancels out, leaving `7x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. On the right, `-10 + 2` equals -8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. (Moving two steps to the right on a number line from -10 lands on -8) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
    This simplifies the equation to:
    ```
    7x = -8
    ```
    <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>

2.  **Solve for the variable:** To isolate `x`, divide both sides of the equation by 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.
    ```
    7x / 7 = -8 / 7
    ```
    On the left, `7x / 7` simplifies to `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. On the right, `-8 / 7` can be left as a fraction or converted to a mixed number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
    Therefore, the solution is:
    ```
    x = -8/7  or  x = -1 1/7
    ```
    <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>

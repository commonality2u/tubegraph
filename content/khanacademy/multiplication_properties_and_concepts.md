[[understanding_basic_multiplication | Multiplication]] is a fundamental arithmetic operation that serves as a simplified method for performing [[addition_and_multiplication_relationship | repeated addition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Instead of adding a number to itself multiple times, multiplication provides a concise way to find the total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## Basic Concept

When considering an expression like "2 times 3" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>:
*   It can be interpreted as adding the number 2 to itself three times (2 + 2 + 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. In this case, the '3' indicates how many times the '2' should be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   The sum of 2 + 2 + 2 equals 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Commutative Property

A key property of multiplication is that the order of the numbers being multiplied (factors) does not change the result (product) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

For example, "2 times 3" can also be interpreted as "3 two times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>:
*   This means adding the number 3 to itself two times (3 + 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   The '2' tells how many times the '3' is added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   The sum of 3 + 3 also equals 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

This consistency in results, regardless of the order of the factors, is a fundamental aspect of multiplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This property is often referred to as the Commutative Property of Multiplication.

## Usefulness of Multiplication

Multiplication is particularly useful for [[using_multiplication_for_efficient_counting | efficient counting]], especially when dealing with large sets of items arranged in groups or arrays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

For instance, to count items arranged in rows and columns:
1.  Count the number of items in a single row <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
2.  Count the total number of rows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
3.  Multiply these two numbers to find the total count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

Example: If there are 3 lemons in each row and 4 rows, the total number of lemons is 4 times 3 (4 x 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
*   Using repeated addition for "4 times 3" would be 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   Alternatively, "3 times 4" would be 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
Both interpretations yield the same total of 12 lemons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

## Properties of Special Numbers

### Multiplication by One (Identity Property)
Any number multiplied by 1, or 1 multiplied by any number, results in that original number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
*   This can be understood as having the number 'one time' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. For example, "3 times 1" means three 1s (1 + 1 + 1 = 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>, or it means 3 taken one time, which is just 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
*   Examples:
    *   3 x 1 = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>
    *   1 x 3 = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>
    *   100 x 1 = 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>
    *   1 x 39 = 39 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>

### Multiplication by Zero (Zero Property)
Any number multiplied by 0, or 0 multiplied by any number, always results in 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.
*   This can be understood as having 'zero times' that number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. For instance, "4 times 0" means four 0s (0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. Alternatively, it means having 4 zero times, which implies not writing 4 at all, resulting in nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.
*   Examples:
    *   4 x 0 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>
    *   5,493,692 x 0 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>
    *   0 x 17 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>

Understanding the [[slope_of_a_line_in_algebra | slope]] of a straight line is a fundamental concept in mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. It is a concept that is less complex than derivatives, which deal with the [[slope_of_a_curve | slope of a curve]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Definition and Calculation

For a straight line, the [[slope_of_a_line_in_algebra | slope]] is consistently the same across its entire length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This means that unlike curves, the [[slope_of_a_line_in_algebra | slope]] of a straight line does not change from point to point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

To find the [[slope_of_a_line_in_algebra | slope]] of a straight line, you can select any two distinct points on the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The [[slope_of_a_line_in_algebra | slope]] is then calculated as the [[definition_of_slope_as_change_in_y_over_change_in_x | change in y divided by the change in x]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

Using mathematical notation, this is expressed as:
$ \text{Slope} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} $
where $\Delta y$ represents the change in the y-coordinate and $\Delta x$ represents the change in the x-coordinate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

Straight lines often follow the [[slopeintercept_form | standard y equals mx plus b]] equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

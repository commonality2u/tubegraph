From: [[khanacademy]] <br/> 

The concept of a straight line's slope is fundamental in mathematics, and it sets the stage for understanding more complex topics like derivatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Math begins to become much more engaging with these concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Understanding the Slope of a Straight Line

For a straight line, calculating the [[finding_the_slope_of_a_line | slope]] is a straightforward process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The [[slope of a line in algebra | slope]] is universally consistent across the entire line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, meaning it does not change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

### Calculating Slope

To [[finding the slope of a line | find the slope]] of a straight line at any given point, you can select any two points on the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The slope is then defined as the change in the y-coordinate divided by the change in the x-coordinate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

The formula for slope is typically expressed as:
$$
\text{Slope} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}
$$
Where:
*   $\Delta y$ (delta y) represents the change in y <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   $\Delta x$ (delta x) represents the change in x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

This formula is very straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Contrast with Curves

Unlike straight lines, the [[slope of a curve | slope of a curve]] is not constant; it continually changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. For example, in a curve like $y = x^2$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, the slope varies from nearly flat to increasingly steep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This means there isn't a single slope for the entire curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

### The Role of Derivatives

To determine the slope of a curve at a specific point, calculus introduces the concept of the derivative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. The derivative is defined as the [[slope of a curve using tangent lines | slope of a curve at an exact point]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This allows for finding the slope of most continuous curves at a precise point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

This concept of finding the instantaneous slope using derivatives is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. It's where limits become a useful concept in mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

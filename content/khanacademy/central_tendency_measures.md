## What is Statistics?

Statistics involves understanding and working with data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. It can be broadly classified into three categories:
*   **Descriptive Statistics**: This involves finding indicative numbers that represent a large set of data without having to present all of the data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Predictive Statistics**: Grouped with inferential statistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **Inferential Statistics**: Uses data, often from a sample, to make conclusions or inferences about a larger population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. For example, surveying three people about presidential votes is a sample, not the entire population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

This article focuses on [[descriptive_statistics | descriptive statistics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## Understanding Central Tendency

When describing a set of numbers, people often look for a number that is most indicative of all the numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, or a number that represents the [[central_tendency_in_statistics | central tendency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This concept is also commonly referred to as the "average" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. An average is a number that gives a sense of [[central_tendency_in_statistics | central tendency]] or is most representative of a set of numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

There are several ways to measure [[measures_of_central_tendency | central tendency]] (or average) for a set of numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>:
*   The [[mean_in_statistics | Mean]]
*   The [[Median | Median]]
*   The Mode

In statistics, these all represent a data set's or population's [[central_tendency_in_statistics | central tendency]], or a sample's [[central_tendency_in_statistics | central tendency]], and can collectively be considered forms of an average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. In everyday language, when people refer to "average," they typically mean the arithmetic [[mean_in_statistics | mean]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## The Mean

The [[mean_in_statistics | mean]], or arithmetic [[mean_in_statistics | mean]], is calculated by adding all the numbers in a set and then dividing by the count of numbers in that set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Other types of means exist, such as geometric and harmonic means, but the arithmetic [[mean_in_statistics | mean]] is the most common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

**Example**: For the set of numbers {1, 1, 2, 3, 4} <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>:
1.  Sum the numbers: 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>
2.  Count the numbers: There are 5 numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
3.  Divide the sum by the count: 11 / 5 = 2.2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

The [[mean_in_statistics | mean]] of 2.2 is considered a representative number for this set, indicating its [[central_tendency_in_statistics | central tendency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

## The Median

The [[Median | median]] is found by arranging the numbers in order and then identifying the middle number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

**Example (Odd number of data points)**: For the set {1, 1, 2, 3, 4} <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>:
1.  The numbers are already in order.
2.  With five numbers, the middle number is the third one: 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. There are two numbers less than 2 and two numbers greater than 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
3.  The [[Median | median]] of this set is 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

**Example (Even number of data points)**: For the set {1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4} <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>:
1.  There is no single middle number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
2.  Take the two middle numbers, which are 2 and 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
3.  Calculate the arithmetic [[mean_in_statistics | mean]] of these two numbers: (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
4.  The [[Median | median]] of this set is 2.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

## The Mode

The mode is the number that appears most frequently in a set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

**Example**: For the set {1, 1, 2, 3, 4} <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>:
*   The number 1 appears twice, while others appear once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   The mode is 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

A set can have multiple modes if two or more numbers share the highest frequency. For example, in the set {1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4}, both 1 and 4 appear twice, making both potential modes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

## Why Different Measures? (Impact of Outliers)

Different measures of [[central_tendency_in_statistics | central tendency]] are useful because they can be affected differently by the data's distribution, especially by "outliers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. An outlier is a number that "really sticks out" from the rest of the data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

**Example**: Consider the set {3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 100} <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>:

*   **Arithmetic Mean**:
    *   Sum: 5 * 3 + 100 = 15 + 100 = 115 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>
    *   Count: 6 numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>
    *   Mean: 115 / 6 = 19 and 1/6 (approx. 19.17) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>
    This [[mean_in_statistics | mean]] of 19.17 might not feel truly representative, as most numbers are 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. It is skewed by the large outlier, 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

*   **Median**:
    *   The numbers are already in order.
    *   With an even number of data points, the middle two numbers are 3 and 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
    *   The arithmetic [[mean_in_statistics | mean]] of 3 and 3 is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
    The [[Median | median]] of 3 is a better measurement of the [[central_tendency_in_statistics | central tendency]] in this case, as it is less affected by the outlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

*   **Mode**:
    *   The most common number in the set is 3 (appearing five times) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
    The mode of 3 also provides a good indication of what the numbers in the set represent, especially with the outlier present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

Using the [[Median | median]] or mode can provide a more intuitive sense of [[central_tendency_in_statistics | central tendency]] when outliers are present, preventing a skewed perception of the data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

> These [[mean median and mode | measures of central tendency]] are human constructs designed to help understand large sets of data, not formulas discovered as universal truths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

## Beyond Central Tendency

In addition to [[measures of central tendency | central tendency]], [[descriptive_statistics | descriptive statistics]] also explores [[measures of dispersion | measures of dispersion]], which describe how spread apart the data points are from the [[central_tendency_in_statistics | central tendency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

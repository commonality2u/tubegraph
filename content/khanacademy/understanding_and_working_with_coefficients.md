When solving mathematical equations, a key concept is understanding and working with coefficients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. These are crucial for [[understanding mathematical equations | isolating variables]] to find their values.

## What is a Coefficient?

A coefficient is defined as the number that is multiplying a variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. For example, in the expression `3x`, the number `3` is the coefficient of `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

## Working with Coefficients in Equations

When solving an [[understanding linear equations | equation]] like `5 = 3x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, the goal is to [[understanding mathematical equations | isolate]] the variable `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. To do this, you need to eliminate the coefficient from the side of the equation containing the variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

The process involves:
1.  **Identifying the coefficient:** In `5 = 3x`, the coefficient of `x` is `3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
2.  **Performing the inverse operation:** Since the variable `x` is being multiplied by the coefficient `3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>, the inverse operation is division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
3.  **Dividing both sides:** Divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
    *   `5 / 3 = 3x / 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>
4.  **Simplifying:** The coefficients on the right-hand side cancel out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, leaving `x` isolated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
    *   `5/3 = x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>

This results in `x = 5/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>, or as a mixed number, `x = 1 2/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. The exact same answer is obtained whether the variable is on the left or right side of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. These [[understanding algebraic expressions | algebraic steps]] are fundamental to solving equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

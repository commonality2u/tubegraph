From: [[khanacademy]] <br/> 

The [[introduction_to_laplace_transform | Laplace Transform]] is considered one of the most useful mathematical concepts, particularly for those in engineering fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. It extends beyond simply solving [[introduction_to_differential_equations | differential equations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Key Engineering Applications

### Solving [[introduction_to_differential_equations | Differential Equations]]
The [[introduction_to_laplace_transform | Laplace Transform]] is a valuable tool for solving [[introduction_to_differential_equations | differential equations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. It allows for the solution of more and more difficult problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

### [[time_and_frequency_domain_conversion | Time and Frequency Domain Conversion]]
A significant application in engineering is the ability of the [[introduction_to_laplace_transform | Laplace Transform]] to convert functions or waveforms from the [[time_and_frequency_domain_conversion | time domain]] to the [[time_and_frequency_domain_conversion | frequency domain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This conversion aids in studying and understanding various phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This conversion process from a function of time to a function of frequency is a common practice in engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

> [!INFO] Definition
> The [[introduction_to_laplace_transform | Laplace Transform]] of a function `f(t)` (often denoted as `L{f(t)}`) transforms it into another function of `s` (a frequency variable), typically denoted as `F(s)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. This transformation is defined by the improper integral:
> `L{f(t)} = F(s) = ∫[0 to ∞] e^(-st) f(t) dt` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

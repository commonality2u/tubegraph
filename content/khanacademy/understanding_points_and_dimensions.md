Geometry is the study of how shapes and space relate to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The word "geometry" itself originates from "earth measurement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, derived from the root word "geo" (earth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a> and "metry" (measurement) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The subject encompasses concepts like lines, triangles, circles, angles, patterns, and [[twodimensional_and_threedimensional_space | three-dimensional shapes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Fundamental Geometric Concepts

### Points
A **point** is a basic starting block in geometry, represented as a dot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. It is a specific position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, and one cannot move on a point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. To distinguish between different points, they are typically labeled with letters, such as Point A, Point B, or Point C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### Dimensions
A point has **zero dimensions** because you cannot move in any direction (up, down, left, right, in, or out) while staying on that point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

### [[line_segments_and_their_properties | Line Segments]]
A **line segment** consists of all points that connect two specific points along a straight path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. These two specific points are called the **endpoints** of the line segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

*   **Notation**: A line segment connecting points A and B is denoted by writing the endpoints with a line over them, e.g., $\overline{AB}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. The order of the letters does not matter; $\overline{BA}$ refers to the same line segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   **Length**: The length or distance of a line segment is indicated by writing the endpoints without the line over them, e.g., $AB = 5$ units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
*   **Dimensions**: A line segment has **one dimension** because movement is restricted to back and forth along its path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. An ideal line segment has no width, only length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

### [[rays_and_lines_in_geometry | Rays]]
A **ray** is similar to a line segment but extends infinitely in one direction from a starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. The starting point of a ray is called its **vertex** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

*   **Notation**: A ray starting at A and passing through D is denoted $\overrightarrow{AD}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.
*   **Order Matters**: Unlike line segments, the order of letters matters for rays. $\overrightarrow{DA}$ would indicate a ray starting at D and going through A, which is different from $\overrightarrow{AD}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

### [[rays_and_lines_in_geometry | Lines]]
A **line** is a one-dimensional object that extends infinitely in both directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

*   **Notation**: A line passing through points E and F is denoted $\overleftrightarrow{EF}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
*   **Distinction**: A line differs from a line segment in that it never ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

### Collinear Points
Points are **collinear** if they all lie on the same straight line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. For example, if X, Y, and Z are on the same line, they are collinear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

### Midpoint
The **midpoint** of a line segment is the point that is exactly halfway between its two endpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. If point Z is the midpoint of line segment XY, then the distance from X to Z is equal to the distance from Z to Y ($XZ = ZY$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

## Dimensions in Geometry
*   **Zero Dimensions**: A **point** has zero dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   **One Dimension**: [[basic_concepts_in_onedimensional_motion | Line segments]], [[rays_and_lines_in_geometry | rays]], and [[rays_and_lines_in_geometry | lines]] are one-dimensional objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. You can only move back and forth along their path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
*   **Two Dimensions**: A **plane** is a two-dimensional object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. On a plane, you can move in two different directions, such as left/right and up/down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. A piece of paper that extends infinitely in every direction is an example of a plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.
*   **Three Dimensions**: [[twodimensional_and_threedimensional_space | Three-dimensional space]] allows for movement in three directions: left/right, up/down, and in/out (into or out of a screen) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.
*   **Higher Dimensions**: In advanced mathematics, it is possible to study [[matrix_dimensions_and_types | objects with more than three dimensions]], though these are difficult to visualize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

When working with [[right_triangles_and_their_properties | right triangles]], certain specific angle combinations lead to predictable side ratios. One such example is the 30-60-90 triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

## Properties of a 30-60-90 Triangle

A 30-60-90 triangle is a [[right_triangles_and_their_properties | right triangle]] that contains angles measuring 30, 60, and 90 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Key properties include:
*   The side opposite the 30-degree angle is half the length of the [[identifying_the_hypotenuse_in_right_triangles | hypotenuse]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   The side opposite the 60-degree angle is $\sqrt{3}$ times the length of the side opposite the 30-degree angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

An example of a 30-60-90 triangle might have sides with lengths 2, $2\sqrt{3}$, and a [[identifying_the_hypotenuse_in_right_triangles | hypotenuse]] of 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This configuration satisfies the [[using_the_pythagorean_theorem | Pythagorean theorem]] ( (2$\sqrt{3}$)$^2$ + 2$^2$ = 4$^2$, which simplifies to 12 + 4 = 16) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

## Calculating Trigonometric Functions

[[application_of_trigonometry_in_right_triangles | Trigonometric functions]] (sine, cosine, and tangent) for angles in a 30-60-90 triangle can be calculated using the [[sohcahtoa_mnemonic_for_trigonometric_functions | SOHCAHTOA mnemonic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

### Trigonometric Functions for 30 Degrees

For a 30-degree angle in a 30-60-90 triangle where the side opposite is 2, the adjacent side is $2\sqrt{3}$, and the [[identifying_the_hypotenuse_in_right_triangles | hypotenuse]] is 4:
*   **Sine (SOH)**: Opposite / Hypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>
    *   $\sin(30^\circ) = \text{Opposite} / \text{Hypotenuse} = 2 / 4 = 1/2$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>
*   **Cosine (CAH)**: Adjacent / Hypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>
    *   $\cos(30^\circ) = \text{Adjacent} / \text{Hypotenuse} = 2\sqrt{3} / 4 = \sqrt{3} / 2$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>
*   **Tangent (TOA)**: Opposite / Adjacent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>
    *   $\tan(30^\circ) = \text{Opposite} / \text{Adjacent} = 2 / (2\sqrt{3}) = 1/\sqrt{3}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>
    *   Rationalized: $\tan(30^\circ) = \sqrt{3} / 3$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>

### Trigonometric Functions for 60 Degrees

For a 60-degree angle in the same 30-60-90 triangle, the side opposite is $2\sqrt{3}$, the adjacent side is 2, and the [[identifying_the_hypotenuse_in_right_triangles | hypotenuse]] is 4:
*   **Sine (SOH)**: Opposite / Hypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>
    *   $\sin(60^\circ) = \text{Opposite} / \text{Hypotenuse} = 2\sqrt{3} / 4 = \sqrt{3} / 2$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>
*   **Cosine (CAH)**: Adjacent / Hypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>
    *   $\cos(60^\circ) = \text{Adjacent} / \text{Hypotenuse} = 2 / 4 = 1/2$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>
*   **Tangent (TOA)**: Opposite / Adjacent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>
    *   $\tan(60^\circ) = \text{Opposite} / \text{Adjacent} = (2\sqrt{3}) / 2 = \sqrt{3}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>

### Relationship Between 30 and 60 Degree Functions

Notice the relationship between the sine and cosine values for 30 and 60 degrees:
*   $\sin(30^\circ) = \cos(60^\circ) = 1/2$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>
*   $\cos(30^\circ) = \sin(60^\circ) = \sqrt{3}/2$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>
This occurs because the opposite side for one angle becomes the adjacent side for the other acute angle in the same [[right_triangles_and_their_properties | right triangle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

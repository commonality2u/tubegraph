[[basic_probability_concepts | Probability]] provides a way to quantify the chances of fundamentally random events occurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. One foundational concept in [[calculating_probability_of_an_event | calculating probability]] is that of "equally likely possibilities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## Defining Probability with Equally Likely Possibilities

When dealing with a set of outcomes that are all equally likely to occur, the probability of a specific event is defined as:

$$ P(\text{Event}) = \frac{\text{Number of possibilities that meet the conditions}}{\text{Total number of equally likely possibilities}} $$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>

This definition implies that each potential outcome has an identical chance of happening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Examples of Equally Likely Possibilities

### [[concept_of_a_fair_coin_and_calculating_probability | Fair Coin Flip]]

A [[concept_of_a_fair_coin_and_calculating_probability | fair coin]] is one where it has an equal chance of landing on one side or the other, meaning its weight is distributed evenly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. The two possible outcomes are heads or tails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

*   **Probability of getting Heads**:
    *   Total equally likely possibilities: 2 (Heads, Tails) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>
    *   Possibilities meeting the condition (Heads): 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>
    *   $$P(\text{Heads}) = \frac{1}{2}$$ or 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>

### [[probability_of_rolling_a_die | Rolling a Fair Die]]

A fair die has six sides, each representing a number from 1 to 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. All six outcomes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) are equally likely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

*   **Probability of rolling a 1**:
    *   Total equally likely possibilities: 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>
    *   Possibilities meeting the condition (rolling a 1): 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>
    *   $$P(\text{1}) = \frac{1}{6}$$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>

*   **Probability of rolling a 1 or a 6**:
    *   Total equally likely possibilities: 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>
    *   Possibilities meeting the condition (rolling a 1 or a 6): 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>
    *   $$P(\text{1 or 6}) = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}$$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>

*   **Probability of rolling an even number**:
    *   Total equally likely possibilities: 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>
    *   Possibilities meeting the condition (even numbers: 2, 4, 6): 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>
    *   $$P(\text{Even}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>

## Relationship to Repeated Experiments

Another way to conceptualize probability, which aligns with the idea of equally likely possibilities, is to consider what happens if an experiment is run many times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. If an experiment (like flipping a coin) is conducted an extremely large number of times (e.g., a million or a billion times), the percentage of outcomes that meet a specific condition will tend to approach the theoretical probability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. For a fair coin, if flipped infinitely many times, 50% of the flips would be heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

## Mutually Exclusive Events

It's important to distinguish between events that can happen and those that cannot. For instance, when rolling a single die, getting a 2 and a 3 on the same roll is impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. These are [[mutually_exclusive_events_in_probability | mutually exclusive events]] because they cannot occur at the same time in one experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. The probability of such an event is 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

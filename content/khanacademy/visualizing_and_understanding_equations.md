Understanding equations involves recognizing what they mean and how to manipulate them systematically to find unknown values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. While simple equations can sometimes be solved mentally, more complex ones require a systematic approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Basic Equation Interpretation

Consider the equation 7 times x is equal to 14 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This means that 7 multiplied by some unknown number 'x' results in 14 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. You might mentally determine that 7 times 2 equals 14, so x must be 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. However, it's crucial to understand the underlying principles for solving more complex equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

### Algebraic Notation
In algebra, the multiplication symbol (×) is often omitted when a number is placed next to a variable. For instance, "7x" literally means "7 times x" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This shorthand notation avoids confusion, especially since 'x' is a commonly used variable and could be mistaken for a multiplication sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Sometimes, a dot (·) might be used to represent multiplication, such as 7 · x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## [[visualization_techniques_in_solving_equations | Visualizing Equations]]
To understand how to manipulate an equation, it can be helpful to [[visualization_techniques_in_solving_equations | visualize]] it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **7x**: This represents 'x' added to itself seven times (x + x + x + x + x + x + x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **7x = 14**: This means that the total value of these seven 'x's is equal to 14 individual objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### Solving by Division
A fundamental rule in solving equations is that whatever operation is performed on one side of the equation must also be performed on the other side to maintain equality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

To isolate the variable 'x' in `7x = 14`, you divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient (the number multiplying the variable), which in this case is 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

<div class="callout">
7x / 7 = 14 / 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>
x = 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>
</div>

[[visualization_techniques_in_solving_equations | Visually]], if 7 'x's are equal to 14 objects, dividing both sides by 7 means grouping the 7 'x's into seven individual 'x's and grouping the 14 objects into seven equal portions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Each 'x' will then correspond to 2 objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

### Equivalence of Division and Multiplication
Dividing both sides of an equation by a number is equivalent to multiplying both sides by that number's reciprocal. For example, dividing by 3 is the same as multiplying by 1/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

<div class="callout">
3x = 15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>
Divide by 3: x = 15 / 3 = 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>
Multiply by 1/3: (1/3) * 3x = (1/3) * 15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>
1x = 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>
x = 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>
</div>

## Solving Equations with Multiple Terms
Sometimes, equations involve multiple terms with the same variable, such as 2y + 4y = 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

### Combining Like Terms
[[visualization_techniques_in_solving_equations | Visualizing]] this, 2y means y + y, and 4y means y + y + y + y <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. When added together, you have a total of six 'y's (y + y + y + y + y + y) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. This simplifies the equation to:

<div class="callout">
6y = 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>
</div>

This concept is similar to adding 2 apples plus 4 apples to get 6 apples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. Once simplified, you can solve for 'y' by dividing both sides by the coefficient:

<div class="callout">
6y / 6 = 18 / 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>
y = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>
</div>

### Checking the Solution
It's always a good practice to check your answer by substituting the found value back into the original equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

For y = 3 in `2y + 4y = 18`:
2(3) + 4(3) = 6 + 12 = 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>
Since 18 = 18, the solution is correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

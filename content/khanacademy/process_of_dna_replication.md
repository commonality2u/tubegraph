[[dna_structure_as_the_molecular_basis_of_heredity | DNA's double helix structure]], resembling a twisted ladder, makes it suitable as the molecular basis of heredity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article conceptually explains the mechanism by which [[dna_and_its_function_in_cells | DNA]] serves this role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. A typical [[dna_and_its_function_in_cells | DNA molecule]] can be tens of millions of base pairs long, not just a few <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Requirements for Heredity
For a molecule to be the basis of heredity, it must be replicable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This is crucial because when a cell divides, the two resulting cells must receive identical genetic material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## DNA Replication
The process by which [[dna_and_its_function_in_cells | DNA]] duplicates itself is called replication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Conceptually, replication involves splitting the two sides of the [[dna_structure_as_the_molecular_basis_of_heredity | DNA ladder]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Each separated strand then serves as a template to construct a new complementary strand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

### Base Pairing during Replication
During replication, specific base pairing rules are followed:
*   Adenine (A) always pairs with Thymine (T) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   Thymine (T) always pairs with Adenine (A) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   Guanine (G) always pairs with Cytosine (C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   Cytosine (C) always pairs with Guanine (G) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

By following these rules, each original half of the [[dna_structure_as_the_molecular_basis_of_heredity | DNA ladder]] constructs its complementary side, resulting in two identical [[dna_and_its_function_in_cells | DNA molecules]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. This process occurs before a cell divides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

## DNA, Chromosomes, and Genes
It's important to distinguish between related terms:
*   **DNA:** Refers to the molecule itself, with its sugar-phosphate backbone and sequence of base pairs in a double helix structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **Chromosome:** A [[dna_and_its_function_in_cells | DNA molecule]] packaged together with other molecules and proteins into a broader structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
*   **Gene:** A specific section of [[dna_and_its_function_in_cells | DNA]] that codes for a certain type of protein, defining a particular trait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Genes can range from several thousand to millions of base pairs long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

## Gene Expression: Transcription and Translation
For the genetic information to be useful, it must be expressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. The expression of genes from [[dna_and_its_function_in_cells | DNA]] into proteins occurs through a related molecule called RNA (Ribonucleic Acid) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

### RNA
RNA, or ribonucleic acid, has a sugar backbone similar to [[dna_and_its_function_in_cells | DNA]] but is not deoxyribonucleic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. In cells with nuclei, [[dna_and_its_function_in_cells | DNA]] information must generally leave the nucleus to be expressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. RNA often acts as a messenger, transporting information from a [[dna_and_its_function_in_cells | DNA section]] outside the nucleus to be translated into a protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

### Transcription
Transcription is the process of creating a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule from a [[dna_and_its_function_in_cells | DNA]] template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
*   Similar to [[dna_and_its_function_in_cells | DNA replication]], one strand of [[dna_and_its_function_in_cells | DNA]] serves as a template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
*   When forming RNA, Adenine (A) pairs with Uracil (U), not Thymine (T) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   Thymine (T) in [[dna_and_its_function_in_cells | DNA]] still pairs with Adenine (A) in RNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
*   Cytosine (C) and Guanine (G) still pair with each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.
*   The resulting single strand of messenger RNA (mRNA) carries the information from that [[dna_and_its_function_in_cells | DNA section]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. This mRNA can then leave the nucleus and attach to a ribosome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

### Translation
Translation is the process of converting the base pair sequence of mRNA into an amino acid sequence, which forms a protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

#### Codons and Amino Acids
*   Each sequence of three bases on the mRNA is called a **codon** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   There are four possible bases, so three positions lead to 4 x 4 x 4 = 64 possible codons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.
*   These 64 codons code for 20 possible amino acids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. This allows for multiple codons to code for the same amino acid and for codons to have other functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.
*   A ribosome reads the mRNA codons, and another type of RNA, called transfer RNA (tRNA), matches specific amino acids to their corresponding codons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.
*   As amino acids are linked together in sequence, they form proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.

#### Proteins
Proteins are fundamental molecules that largely "run life," acting as enzymes, structural components (like muscle), and performing many other functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. They can be thousands or more amino acids long, forming complex shapes with diverse functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. This entire process demonstrates how the information for life is stored and utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.

[[balancing_chemical_equations | Balancing chemical equations]] is a fundamental concept taught in first-year chemistry that describes [[chemical_reactions | chemical reactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While it can initially seem challenging, it is a straightforward process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## What is a Chemical Equation?

A [[chemical_equation | chemical equation]] essentially describes a [[chemical_reaction | chemical reaction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. It shows the substances that react, known as **reactants**, and the substances that are formed, known as **products** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

For example, in the reaction of aluminum with oxygen gas to form aluminum oxide:
`Al + O₂ → Al₂O₃` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>

*   **Reactants:** Aluminum (Al) and diatomic oxygen (O₂) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>
*   **Products:** Aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>

## The Problem of Unbalanced Equations

An unbalanced equation shows a different number of atoms of each element on the reactant side compared to the product side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This violates the law of conservation of mass, which states that matter cannot be created or destroyed.

In the example above:
*   **Aluminum:** One atom on the reactant side, two atoms on the product side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   **Oxygen:** Two atoms on the reactant side (in O₂), three atoms on the product side (in Al₂O₃) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>

[[balancing_chemical_equations | Balancing equations]] involves adjusting coefficients (the numbers in front of molecules) so that the number of atoms for each element is the same on both sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Strategies for Balancing Chemical Equations

### 1. Adjusting Coefficients to Equalize Atoms

Let's balance `Al + O₂ → Al₂O₃` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>:

*   **Aluminum:** To get two aluminums on the left, add a coefficient of 2:
    `2Al + O₂ → Al₂O₃` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>
    (Now, 2 Al on left, 2 Al on right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>)

*   **Oxygen:** There are two oxygens on the left and three on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. To make them equal, you could multiply the O₂ by 1.5:
    `2Al + 1.5 O₂ → Al₂O₃` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>
    (Now, 3 O on left, 3 O on right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>)

*   **Eliminating Fractions:** You cannot have half an atom or molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Multiply the entire equation by 2 to clear the fraction:
    `2 * (2Al + 1.5 O₂ → Al₂O₃)`
    `4Al + 3O₂ → 2Al₂O₃` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>

This final equation is balanced: 4 Al on both sides, 6 O on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

> [!CAUTION]
> You **cannot** change the subscripts within a chemical formula (e.g., changing O₂ to O₃) or the relative ratios of atoms within a molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. You can only change the number of whole molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### 2. Balancing Complex Molecules First

When dealing with more complex [[chemical_reactions_and_equations | chemical reactions]], it's often easiest to start by balancing the most complicated molecules first, and leave single-atom molecules (like O₂) for last <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. This is because changing the coefficient of a complex molecule affects multiple elements, whereas changing a single-atom molecule's coefficient only affects that one element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

**Example: Methane Combustion**
`CH₄(g) + O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + H₂O(l)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>

*   **Carbon:** One carbon on each side – balanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **Hydrogen:** Four hydrogens in CH₄, but only two in H₂O <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Put a 2 in front of H₂O:
    `CH₄(g) + O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(l)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>
    (Now, 4 H on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>)

*   **Oxygen (last):**
    *   Right side: Two oxygens in CO₂ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>, plus two oxygens in 2H₂O (2 * 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Total of 4 oxygens.
    *   Left side: Two oxygens in O₂ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
    *   To get 4 oxygens on the left, put a 2 in front of O₂:
    `CH₄(g) + 2O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(l)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>

This equation is now balanced: 1 C, 4 H, 4 O on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

**Example: Ethane Combustion**
`C₂H₆ + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>

*   **Carbon:** Two carbons in C₂H₆, one in CO₂. Put a 2 in front of CO₂:
    `C₂H₆ + O₂ → 2CO₂ + H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>

*   **Hydrogen:** Six hydrogens in C₂H₆, two in H₂O. Put a 3 in front of H₂O:
    `C₂H₆ + O₂ → 2CO₂ + 3H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>
    (Now, 6 H on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>)

*   **Oxygen (last):**
    *   Right side: Four oxygens in 2CO₂ (2 * 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>, plus three oxygens in 3H₂O (3 * 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Total of 7 oxygens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
    *   Left side: Two oxygens in O₂ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
    *   To get 7 oxygens on the left, put a 3.5 in front of O₂:
    `C₂H₆ + 3.5 O₂ → 2CO₂ + 3H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>

*   **Eliminating Fractions:** Multiply the entire equation by 2:
    `2C₂H₆ + 7O₂ → 4CO₂ + 6H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>

The equation is balanced: 4 C, 12 H, 14 O on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

### 3. Treating Polyatomic Ions as Single Units

Sometimes, a group of atoms (a polyatomic ion) remains intact throughout the [[chemical_reaction | chemical reaction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. You can treat this group as a single "atom" to simplify the balancing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

**Example: Iron Oxide and Sulfuric Acid**
`Fe₂O₃ + H₂SO₄ → Fe₂(SO₄)₃ + H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>

Notice the sulfate group (SO₄) appears on both sides. Substitute SO₄ with 'x':
`Fe₂O₃ + H₂x → Fe₂x₃ + H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>

*   **Iron (Fe):** Two irons on both sides – balanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
*   **Oxygen (O):** Three oxygens in Fe₂O₃, one in H₂O <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Put a 3 in front of H₂O:
    `Fe₂O₃ + H₂x → Fe₂x₃ + 3H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>
    (Now, 3 O on both sides, excluding the 'x' group oxygens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>)

*   **Hydrogen (H):** Six hydrogens on the right in 3H₂O (3 * 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. Two hydrogens in H₂x. Put a 3 in front of H₂x:
    `Fe₂O₃ + 3H₂x → Fe₂x₃ + 3H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>

*   **Sulfate (x):** Three 'x' groups on the left (3 * 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. Three 'x' groups on the right in Fe₂x₃ – balanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

Now, substitute SO₄ back for 'x':
`Fe₂O₃ + 3H₂SO₄ → Fe₂(SO₄)₃ + 3H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>

This equation is balanced.

## Another Example: Carbon Dioxide and Hydrogen
`CO₂ + H₂ → CH₄ + H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>

*   **Carbon:** One carbon on each side – balanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.
*   **Oxygen:** Two oxygens in CO₂, one in H₂O. Put a 2 in front of H₂O:
    `CO₂ + H₂ → CH₄ + 2H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>
    (Now, 2 O on both sides)

*   **Hydrogen (last):**
    *   Right side: Four hydrogens in CH₄ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>, plus four hydrogens in 2H₂O (2 * 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. Total of 8 hydrogens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.
    *   Left side: Two hydrogens in H₂.
    *   To get 8 hydrogens on the left, put a 4 in front of H₂:
    `CO₂ + 4H₂ → CH₄ + 2H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>

This equation is balanced.

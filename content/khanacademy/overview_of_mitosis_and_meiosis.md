This article provides a detailed look into the processes of [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]] and [[overview_of_meiosis | meiosis]], building upon general concepts to explain their specific stages and roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## [[overview_of_mitosis | Mitosis]]

[[overview_of_mitosis | Mitosis]] is the process where a diploid cell duplicates itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. It begins with a diploid cell and results in two diploid cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Formally, [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]] is the duplication of the nucleus, which typically leads to the formation of two entire cells through a process called cytokinesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

The key phases of [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]] include:
*   Prophase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>
*   Metaphase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>
*   Anaphase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>
*   Telophase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>

[[overview_of_mitosis | Mitosis]] is common in almost all somatic cells, such as skin cells and hair cells, and is essential for the duplication of tissues throughout the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## [[overview_of_meiosis | Meiosis]]

[[overview_of_meiosis | Meiosis]] occurs in germ cells and is primarily used to produce gametes, facilitating [[role_of_meiosis_in_sexual_reproduction | sexual reproduction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This process begins with a diploid germ cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a> and involves two rounds of division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The final product is four haploid cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, which are called gametes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>.

The two rounds of [[overview_of_meiosis | meiosis]] are:
1.  **Meiosis I** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>: A diploid cell splits into two haploid cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
2.  **Meiosis II** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>: These haploid cells split further in a mechanism similar to [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

The phases of [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]] (prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase) also exist in each stage of [[overview_of_meiosis | meiosis]] (e.g., prophase I, metaphase I, anaphase I, telophase I, and then prophase II, metaphase II, anaphase II, telophase II) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

## Interphase: The Preparatory Stage

All cells spend most of their time in interphase, which is a period when the cell is carrying out its normal functions, transcribing, and living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. During the S phase of interphase, DNA replication occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Although chromosomes are typically unwound as chromatin during interphase, they replicate, resulting in each chromosome consisting of two sister chromatids connected by a centromere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Homologous pairs of chromosomes are important to consider in [[overview_of_meiosis | meiosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Additionally, centrosomes also replicate during interphase, preparing the cell for division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

## [[stages_and_process_of_meiosis | Stages and Process of Meiosis]]

### Meiosis I

#### Prophase I
In prophase I, the nuclear envelope starts to disappear, and centrosomes move apart, facilitating the development of spindles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Chromosomes, which were in a chromatin state during interphase, begin to condense and form structured chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. A key difference from [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]] is that homologous pairs line up next to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This alignment allows for **crossing over**, a process of [[genetic_variation_through_meiotic_processes | genetic recombination]] where homologous points on two chromosomes exchange genetic material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. This process is highly organized, ensuring that similar genes are exchanged, thereby creating different versions or alleles of those genes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. This phenomenon significantly contributes to [[genetic_variation_through_meiotic_processes | variation]] within a population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. The cut-off point for crossing over is called a chiasma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

#### Metaphase I
By metaphase I, the nuclear envelope is completely gone, and centrosomes have moved to opposite sides of the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Spindle fibers, generated by the centrosomes, attach to the kinetochores located on the centromeres of the chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. The homologous pairs align at the cell's metaphase plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. The orientation of these pairs is random, further adding to [[genetic_variation_through_meiotic_processes | genetic variation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

#### Anaphase I
In anaphase I, the homologous pairs separate and are pulled to opposite poles of the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. Crucially, unlike in [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]] or anaphase II of [[overview_of_meiosis | meiosis]], the sister chromatids remain attached to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. The homologous pair, not the individual chromatids, is pulled apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.

#### Telophase I
During telophase I, the homologous chromosomes reach their respective ends of the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. Microtubules begin to disassemble, and cytokinesis occurs, leading to the division of the cytoplasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. A nuclear envelope reforms around each set of chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. At the end of telophase I, two haploid cells are formed, each containing half the original number of chromosomes, but each chromosome still consists of two sister chromatids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>. The random separation of homologous pairs contributes significantly to variation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.

### Meiosis II

Each of the two haploid cells resulting from [[stages_and_process_of_meiosis | Meiosis I]] then undergoes [[stages_and_process_of_meiosis | Meiosis II]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>. Sometimes, there is an interphase II stage where the cell rests and centrosomes duplicate again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.

#### Prophase II
Similar to prophase I, the nuclear envelope that formed in telophase I disintegrates again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>. The duplicated centrosomes move apart, generating spindle fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.

#### Metaphase II
In metaphase II, centrosomes are at opposite poles of the cell, and spindle fibers attach to the kinetochores on the centromeres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>. The chromosomes, each still composed of two sister chromatids, line up along the metaphase plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>.

#### Anaphase II
Anaphase II is similar to anaphase in [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>. The sister chromatids finally separate and are pulled to opposite poles by the kinetochore microtubules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>. Once separated, these chromatids are now referred to as individual chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>.

#### Telophase II
In telophase II, the newly separated chromosomes arrive at the cell poles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>. The cell elongates, and cytokinesis occurs, dividing the cytoplasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. Nuclear membranes reform around each set of chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>.

The end result of [[overview_of_meiosis | meiosis]] is four haploid cells (gametes), each containing a single set of unreplicated chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>.

The process of [[overview_of_meiosis | meiosis]] with its crossing over and two-stage division, particularly the separation of homologous pairs in Meiosis I and sister chromatids in Meiosis II, is crucial for introducing [[genetic_variation_through_meiotic_processes | genetic variation]] into a species' gene pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.

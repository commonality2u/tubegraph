When solving linear equations, the goal is to isolate the variable (e.g., `x`) on one side of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This often involves performing operations on both sides of the equation to maintain equality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Example 1: Isolating the Variable with Subtraction

Consider the equation: `3x + 5 = 17` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

To [[solving_algebraic_equations | solve algebraic equations]] like this, the first step is to get the term with the variable (the `3x` term) by itself on one side of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   **Step 1: Remove the constant term.**
    To eliminate the `+ 5` on the left-hand side, subtract 5 from both sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This is an example of [[solving_linear_equations_with_addition_and_subtraction | solving linear equations with addition and subtraction]].
    ```
    3x + 5 - 5 = 17 - 5
    ```
    On the left side, `5 - 5` cancels out, leaving `3x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. On the right side, `17 - 5` equals 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
    The equation simplifies to:
    ```
    3x = 12
    ```
*   **Step 2: Isolate the variable.**
    Now that the equation is in the form `3x = 12`, divide both sides by 3 to isolate `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
    ```
    3x / 3 = 12 / 3
    ```
    On the left, `3x / 3` simplifies to `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. On the right, `12 / 3` equals 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
    Therefore, the solution is:
    ```
    x = 4
    ```

## Example 2: Working with Negative Numbers

Let's try a more complex example involving negative numbers: `7x - 2 = -10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

*   **Step 1: Remove the constant term.**
    To get rid of the `- 2` on the left-hand side, add 2 to both sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
    ```
    7x - 2 + 2 = -10 + 2
    ```
    On the left, `-2 + 2` cancels out, leaving `7x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
    On the right, calculate `-10 + 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. When [[adding_negative_numbers | adding negative numbers]], imagine a number line: starting at -10 and moving 2 units to the right results in -8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
    The equation simplifies to:
    ```
    7x = -8
    ```
*   **Step 2: Isolate the variable.**
    Divide both sides of the equation by 7 to isolate `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
    ```
    7x / 7 = -8 / 7
    ```
    On the left, `7x / 7` simplifies to `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
    On the right, the result is `-8/7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>, which can be left as a fraction or converted to a mixed number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
    ```
    x = -8/7  or  x = -1 and 1/7
    ```
    Both forms are acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

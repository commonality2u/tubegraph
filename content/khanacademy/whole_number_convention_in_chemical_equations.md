[[balancing_chemical_equations | Balancing chemical equations]] can often seem confusing, but it can be approached methodically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This process is essential for accurately representing [[chemical_reactions_and_equations | chemical reactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## What is a Chemical Equation?

A [[understanding_the_concept_of_a_chemical_equation | chemical equation]] describes a [[chemical_reactions_and_equations | reaction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. For instance, when an atom of aluminum reacts with a dioxygen molecule (O₂), they form aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

### The Need for Balancing

Upon inspection of an initial chemical equation, you might find that the number of atoms of each element is not the same on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. For example, in the reaction of aluminum with dioxygen to form aluminum oxide:
*   **Aluminum (Al)**: One atom on the left, two atoms on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.
*   **Oxygen (O)**: Two atoms (in O₂) on the left, three atoms (in Al₂O₃) on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.

Atoms cannot simply appear or disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>, so the number of atoms of each element must be equal on both sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. This is the purpose of [[balancing_chemical_equations | balancing the equation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.

## The Whole Number Convention

When [[balancing_chemical_equations | balancing chemical equations]], the goal is to use coefficients in front of each molecule to ensure the number of atoms of each element is equal on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. However, a convention exists that prohibits the use of fractions or decimals as coefficients.

For example, when attempting to balance the aluminum-dioxygen reaction:
$$Al + O_2 \rightarrow Al_2O_3$$
One might initially try to balance aluminum by placing a '2' in front of Al:
$$2Al + O_2 \rightarrow Al_2O_3$$
Now, there are two aluminums on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. However, there are still two oxygens on the left and three on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. To balance the oxygens, one might multiply O₂ by 1.5:
$$2Al + 1.5O_2 \rightarrow Al_2O_3$$
This would result in three oxygen atoms on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

### Why Fractions Are Not Used

The convention in chemistry is to avoid writing "1.5 molecules" or any other non-whole number of molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. The idea of a "half molecule" is considered a bizarre notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. Therefore, all coefficients in a balanced chemical equation must be whole numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

### Achieving Whole Number Coefficients

To convert coefficients like 1.5 into whole numbers, a technique similar to algebra is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. All coefficients in the equation can be multiplied by the same number to eliminate fractions or decimals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.

In the example above, to get rid of the 1.5, all coefficients should be multiplied by 2:
*   Initial balanced equation with a decimal: $2Al + 1.5O_2 \rightarrow 1Al_2O_3$ (Note: implicit '1' for Al₂O₃ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>).
*   Multiply all coefficients by 2:
    *   $2 \times 2 = 4$ for Al <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>
    *   $1.5 \times 2 = 3$ for O₂ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>
    *   $1 \times 2 = 2$ for Al₂O₃ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>

This results in the final, correctly balanced equation with whole number coefficients:
$$4Al + 3O_2 \rightarrow 2Al_2O_3$$

### Verification

After applying the whole number convention, it's crucial to verify the balance of atoms:
*   **Aluminum (Al)**:
    *   Left side: 4 Al atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>
    *   Right side: 2 molecules of Al₂O₃, each with 2 Al atoms (2 x 2 = 4 Al atoms) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.
*   **Oxygen (O)**:
    *   Left side: 3 molecules of O₂, each with 2 O atoms (3 x 2 = 6 O atoms) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.
    *   Right side: 2 molecules of Al₂O₃, each with 3 O atoms (2 x 3 = 6 O atoms) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>.

Since all atoms are now balanced with whole number coefficients, the [[understanding_chemical_equations | chemical equation]] is correctly balanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.

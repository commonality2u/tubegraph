[[introduction_to_chemical_equations | Chemical equations]] describe a reaction, such as aluminum reacting with dioxygen to form aluminum oxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The aluminum oxide molecule contains two aluminum atoms and three oxygen atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### The Purpose of Balancing Chemical Equations
[[Balancing chemical equations | Balancing chemical equations]] ensures that the same number of each type of atom is present on both sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This concept is fundamental to the [[conservation_of_mass_in_chemical_reactions | conservation of mass in chemical reactions]], meaning atoms cannot spontaneously appear or disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

Initially, for the reaction of aluminum (Al) and dioxygen (O₂) to form aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃):
*   On the left (reactants), there is one aluminum atom and two oxygen atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   On the right (product), there are two aluminum atoms and three oxygen atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

To balance the aluminum atoms, doubling the aluminum on the left-hand side from one to two makes the aluminum balanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This results in:
`2Al + O₂ → Al₂O₃`

However, the oxygen atoms remain unbalanced, with two on the left and three on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

### The Whole Number Convention
A common approach to balance the oxygen might be to multiply the dioxygen (O₂) by 1.5 to get three oxygen atoms on the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, yielding:
`2Al + 1.5O₂ → Al₂O₃` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>

However, in chemistry, it is conventional not to use fractional or decimal coefficients for molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. The preference is for "whole number molecules" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

To adhere to this convention, the entire equation (all coefficients) can be multiplied by a number that eliminates any fractions or decimals, similar to [[dealing_with_whole_numbers_in_fraction_calculations | algebraic manipulations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. In this case, multiplying all coefficients by two will convert 1.5 into a whole number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

Starting with the partially balanced equation:
`2Al + 1.5O₂ → 1Al₂O₃` (implicitly 1 on the product side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>)

Multiply all coefficients by 2:
*   `2Al * 2 = 4Al` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>
*   `1.5O₂ * 2 = 3O₂` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>
*   `1Al₂O₃ * 2 = 2Al₂O₃` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>

This yields the fully balanced chemical equation with whole number coefficients:
`4Al + 3O₂ → 2Al₂O₃` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>

Verification of atoms:
*   **Aluminum:** 4 atoms on the left, 4 atoms on the right (2 molecules * 2 atoms/molecule) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   **Oxygen:** 6 atoms on the left (3 molecules * 2 atoms/molecule), 6 atoms on the right (2 molecules * 3 atoms/molecule) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

The chemical equation is now balanced according to the whole number convention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

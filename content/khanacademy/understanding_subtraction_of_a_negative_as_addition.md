When [[subtracting_negative_numbers | subtracting a negative]] number, the operation is equivalent to [[adding_negative_numbers | adding]] a positive number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. This principle simplifies expressions that involve two negative signs in a row.

## The Equivalence Principle

Subtracting a negative value is the same as adding the corresponding positive value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. For example, `2 - (-3)` is exactly the same as `2 + 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. These two statements are equivalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.

## Examples

### Example 1: Positive Number Minus a Negative Number

Consider the expression `2 - (-3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.
When you [[subtracting_negative_numbers | subtract a negative]], it's the same as [[adding_negative_numbers | adding]] the positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.
So, `2 - (-3)` becomes `2 + 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.
The result is `5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.

### Example 2: Negative Number Minus a Negative Number

Consider the expression `-2 - (-3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>.
Although it might seem intimidating to have multiple negatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>, remember that [[subtracting_negative_numbers | subtracting a negative]] will result in a positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.
Thus, `-2 - (-3)` is the exact same thing as `-2 + 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.

To solve `-2 + 3`:
1.  Start at `-2` on the number line, which is 2 units to the left of zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.
2.  Since you are adding `3`, move 3 units to the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
3.  Moving 1, 2, 3 units to the right from -2 lands you at positive 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.

Therefore, `-2 - (-3)` equals `1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. This demonstrates how to approach complex [[adding_and_subtracting_negative_numbers | adding and subtracting negative numbers]] problems by simplifying the operations first.

The [[energy_concepts | concepts of work and energy]] are commonly used in everyday language, but they have specific definitions within physics, though they are not completely unrelated to their colloquial meanings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Work

In physics, [[work_in_physics | work]] is defined as [[energy_concepts | energy]] transferred by a force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This definition, found on Wikipedia, serves as a relatively intuitive starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### The Circular Definition

It's noted that the definitions of [[work_in_physics | work]] and [[energy_concepts | energy]] can be somewhat circular:
> "Wikipedia defines [[energy_concepts | energy]] as the ability to do [[work_in_physics | work]]." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>
> "So they kind of use each other to define each other." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>

Despite this, these [[energy_concepts | concepts]] are fundamental to understanding motion and force in physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. To gain a more quantitative understanding, it's helpful to move to their [[equations_for_work_and_kinetic_energy | equations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### Quantitative Definition of Work

In mechanics, the [[definition of a function | definition]] of [[work_in_physics | work]] is:
Work = Force × Distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>

#### Example:
If a force of 10 Newtons is applied to a block, moving it 7 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>:
Work = 10 Newtons × 7 meters = 70 Newton-meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>

#### Units of Work
The unit for [[work_in_physics | work]] is the Newton-meter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, which is also defined as one Joule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The Joule is the standard unit for both [[work_in_physics | work]] and [[energy_concepts | energy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

## Energy

[[energy_concepts | Energy]] is the "ability to do [[work_in_physics | work]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. There are different forms of [[energy_concepts | energy]].

### Kinetic Energy

[[kinetic_energy_formula | Kinetic energy]] is defined as the [[energy_concepts | energy]] due to motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>, or the [[work_in_physics | work]] needed to accelerate an object from rest to its current velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

#### Derivation of the Kinetic Energy Formula

The formula for [[kinetic_energy_formula | kinetic energy]] can be derived using the relationship between [[work_in_physics | work]] and motion. Consider a block of mass 'm' starting at rest (`vi = 0`) and pushed by a constant force 'F' over a distance 'd' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

1.  **Kinematics Equation**: The final velocity (`vf`) of an accelerating object over a distance is given by:
    `vf^2 = vi^2 + 2ad` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>
    Since the initial velocity (`vi`) is 0, the equation simplifies to:
    `vf^2 = 2ad` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>

2.  **Newton's Second Law**: Force equals mass times acceleration (`F = ma`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Therefore, acceleration (`a`) can be expressed as:
    `a = F/m` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>

3.  **Substitution**: Substitute the expression for 'a' into the kinematics equation:
    `vf^2 = 2 * (F/m) * d` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>
    `vf^2 = (2Fd) / m` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>

4.  **Relating to Work**: Recognize that the [[difference_between_expressions_and_equations | expression]] `F * d` is the [[definition of a function | definition]] of [[work_in_physics | work]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Substitute `Work` for `F * d`:
    `vf^2 = (2 * Work) / m` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>

5.  **Rearranging for Work**: Multiply both sides by 'm' and divide by '2' to solve for [[work_in_physics | work]]:
    `m * vf^2 = 2 * Work` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>
    `Work = (m * vf^2) / 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>

This derived formula represents the [[work_in_physics | work]] done to accelerate the object, which is precisely the [[kinetic_energy_formula | kinetic energy]] it gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

The [[kinetic_energy_formula | kinetic energy formula]] is:
$$KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>
where 'm' is mass and 'v' is velocity. The unit for [[kinetic_energy_formula | kinetic energy]] is Joules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

## Next Steps

Understanding [[kinetic_energy_formula | kinetic energy]] is just one part of the broader study of [[energy_concepts | energy]]. Future discussions will cover other forms of [[energy_concepts | energy]] and the crucial law of conservation of [[energy_concepts | energy]], which explains how different forms of [[energy_concepts | energy]] can interconvert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

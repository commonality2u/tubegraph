A [[understanding_linear_equations | linear equation]] can be represented in an infinite number of ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. For instance, the equation `y = 2x + 3` can be algebraically manipulated into various equivalent forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

Examples of equivalent forms for `y = 2x + 3`:
*   `y = 2x + 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>
*   `-2x + y = 3` (by subtracting `2x` from both sides) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
*   `y - 5 = 2(x - 1)` (which simplifies to the original equation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>

All these representations are equivalent, meaning you can derive one from another using logical algebraic operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Slope-Intercept Form

While there are infinite ways to represent a linear equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, a particularly useful representation is the **slope-intercept form** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This form explicitly solves for `y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>, typically expressed as `y = mx + b`, where `m` and `b` are constants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

The name "slope-intercept form" highlights its key benefits: it makes it very easy to identify both the slope and the y-intercept of the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Identifying the Y-Intercept

The y-intercept is the point where the line crosses the y-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This occurs when `x` is equal to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

For the equation `y = 2x + 3`:
1.  Set `x = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
2.  `y = 2(0) + 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
3.  `y = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

Therefore, the y-intercept is the point `(0, 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. In the slope-intercept form `y = mx + b`, the value `b` directly represents the y-coordinate of the y-intercept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

### Identifying the Slope

The slope of a linear equation describes the steepness and direction of the line. It is defined as the change in `y` (`Δy`) divided by the change in `x` (`Δx`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

For the equation `y = 2x + 3`:
*   If `x` increases by 1 (Δx = 1), `y` increases by 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
    *   Example: From `(0, 3)` to `x = 1`, `y = 2(1) + 3 = 5`. The `Δy` is `5 - 3 = 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
    *   Example: From `x = 1` to `x = 2`, `y = 2(2) + 3 = 7`. The `Δy` is `7 - 5 = 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   The ratio `Δy / Δx` is `2/1 = 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

The slope of the line `y = 2x + 3` is 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. In the slope-intercept form `y = mx + b`, the coefficient of `x` (`m`) directly represents the slope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

### [[graphing_linear_equations | Graphing Linear Equations]] from Slope-Intercept Form

The slope-intercept form makes [[graphing_linear_equations | graphing linear equations]] straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

Consider `y = -x + 2`:
1.  **Identify the y-intercept**: The `b` value is 2, so the y-intercept is `(0, 2)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Plot this point on the y-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
2.  **Identify the slope**: The coefficient of `x` is -1, so the slope is -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. This means for every 1 unit increase in `x`, `y` will decrease by 1 unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
3.  **Plot additional points using the slope**: Starting from the y-intercept `(0, 2)`, move 1 unit to the right (positive x direction) and 1 unit down (negative y direction) to find another point, for example `(1, 1)`. Repeat this process to find more points.
4.  **Draw the line**: Connect the plotted points to form the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

This method allows for quick interpretation of a linear equation's graph directly from its slope-intercept form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

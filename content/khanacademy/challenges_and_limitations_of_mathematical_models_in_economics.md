As economics endeavors to become more rigorous and mathematical, especially in its modern sense, it attempts to apply mathematical frameworks to its theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:47">[05:11:47]</a>. This approach can clarify thinking, allow for the proof of concepts based on assumptions, and enable the visualization of market dynamics through charts and graphs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>.

However, this mathematical rigor comes with significant challenges and limitations.

## Core Limitations of Economic Models

Economic models often start with philosophical or logical ideas about human decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>. To make these ideas mathematically tractable, economists simplify them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>. This simplification can lead to problematic assumptions, such as:
*   "All people are rational" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.
*   "All people are going to act in their own [[the_role_of_selfinterest_in_economic_behavior | self-interest]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>.
*   "All people are going to maximize their gain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>.

These assumptions are often not true, as human beings are motivated by a wide range of factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. While simplifying allows for mathematical treatment, it can be dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. Mathematical conclusions derived from these models might seem very strong and proven, similar to how one might prove relativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>. However, they are fundamentally based on assumptions that could be wrong, over-simplified, or irrelevant to the specific context being analyzed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>. Therefore, it is crucial to approach these conclusions "with a grain of salt," remembering that they rely on simplifying assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>.

## Specific Challenges in [[microeconomics_vs_macroeconomics | Macroeconomics]]

While challenges exist in [[microeconomics_vs_macroeconomics | micro-economics]] due to the complexity of the human brain and individual actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>, [[microeconomics_vs_macroeconomics | macroeconomics]] is arguably "more guilty" of these over-simplifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>. [[microeconomics_vs_macroeconomics | Macroeconomics]] studies the economy in aggregate, involving millions of individual actors and their interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. Aggregating these "infinitely complicated people" and their "fundamentally unpredictable interactions" makes the system "ultra-complicated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>. Making assumptions and then applying mathematics to such a complex system can lead to conclusions and predictions that often prove incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>.

Economists frequently make predictions about the state of the economy, such as economic growth, recessions, and inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>. However, these predictions often turn out to be wrong, and economists frequently disagree on these matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>. This highlights a key distinction:
*   **Economics vs. Physics:** While economic models might *seem* like physics due to their mathematical nature, economics is not a science in the same way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>. It is "open to subjectivity," largely stemming from the choice of underlying assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>.

## The Importance of Intuition

Given these limitations, it is essential for students of economics to develop a strong intuition for what is happening, even without the mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>. This intuition helps in understanding when mathematical results might be "strange" due to over-simplifications or incorrect assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>.

As publisher Alfred Knopf humorously observed, "An economist is a man who states the obvious in terms of the incomprehensible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>. This points to the fact that economic theories, while mathematically expressed, often deal with common-sense or obvious concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>.

Similarly, Lawrence J. Peter, known for Peter's Principals, quipped, "An economist is an expert know will know tomorrow why the things he predicted yesterday didn't happen today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>. This quote serves as a reminder of the inherent unpredictability, especially in [[microeconomics_vs_macroeconomics | macroeconomics]], despite the application of mathematical models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>. Ultimately, while mathematical models are valuable tools, they must always be "taken with a grain of salt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>.

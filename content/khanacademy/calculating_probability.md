[[Understanding probability concepts | Probability]] is a way of measuring the likelihood that something is going to happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. It quantifies the chances of a specific event occurring among all possible outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Components of Probability
When [[calculating_probabilities_for_specific_outcomes | calculating probability]], several terms are used to define the scenario:

*   **Trial** The action or experiment being performed, such as picking a marble out of a bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Event** The specific outcome or set of outcomes of interest, for example, picking a yellow marble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This is the outcome that satisfies the given constraint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Possible Outcomes / Sample Space** The set of all individual results that could occur from a trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This is also referred to as the "sample space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. The total number of outcomes is often called the size of the sample space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Calculating Simple Probability

To [[quantifying_outcomes_for_probability | quantify outcomes]] and determine the probability of an event, you divide the number of outcomes that satisfy the event by the total number of possible outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

Formula:
$$P(\text{Event}) = \frac{\text{Number of outcomes satisfying the event}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}}$$

### Example: Picking a Yellow Marble

Consider a bag containing 3 yellow, 2 red, 2 green, and 1 blue marble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The goal is to find the probability of pulling a yellow marble from the bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

1.  **Identify the Event**: The event in question is "picking a yellow marble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.
2.  **Determine the Number of Outcomes Satisfying the Event**: There are 3 yellow marbles in the bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Therefore, there are 3 outcomes that satisfy the event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
3.  **Determine the Total Number of Possible Outcomes (Sample Space)**:
    *   3 yellow marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>
    *   2 red marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
    *   2 green marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>
    *   1 blue marble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>

    Adding these together: 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 8 possible outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. This collection of all possible results is known as the sample space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

4.  **Calculate the Probability**:
    *   Probability of picking a yellow marble = (Number of yellow marbles) / (Total number of marbles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>
    *   Probability of picking a yellow marble = 3 / 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>

In microeconomics, understanding the distinct concepts of "demand" and "quantity demanded" is fundamental. While often used interchangeably in everyday language, they carry precise meanings in economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## The Law of Demand

The [[law of demand | law of demand]] is a core idea in microeconomics, stating that if the price of a product increases, the [[effects of price changes on quantity demanded | quantity demanded]] for that product will decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Conversely, if the price decreases, the [[effects of price changes on quantity demanded | quantity demanded]] will increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This is a general rule, though there are some exceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Defining the Terms

### Quantity Demanded

The "[[effects of price changes on quantity demanded | quantity demanded]]" refers to a specific numerical quantity of a product that consumers are willing and able to purchase at a given price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. When only the price changes, and all other factors remain constant (ceteris paribus), it is the [[effects of price changes on quantity demanded | quantity demanded]] that changes, not the entire demand relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

### Demand

In a formal economic sense, "demand" is not a quantity itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Instead, it represents the entire relationship between different prices and the corresponding [[effects of price changes on quantity demanded | quantities demanded]], assuming all other factors remain equal (ceteris paribus) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

When demand itself changes, it means the entire relationship shifts, leading to a new demand schedule or demand curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

## Illustrating Demand

The relationship between price and [[effects of price changes on quantity demanded | quantity demanded]] can be illustrated through a [[demand schedule and demand curve | demand schedule]] or a [[demand schedule and demand curve | demand curve]].

### Demand Schedule

A [[demand schedule and demand curve | demand schedule]] is a table that outlines various price points for a product and the corresponding [[effects of price changes on quantity demanded | quantity demanded]] at each of those prices, holding all other factors constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

| :------- | :-------- | :------------------------ |
| A        | 2         | 60,000                    |
| B        | 4         | 40,000                    |
| C        | 6         | 30,000                    |
| D        | 8         | 25,000                    |
| E        | 10        | 23,000                    |

### Demand Curve

A [[demand schedule and demand curve | demand curve]] is a graphical representation of the [[demand schedule and demand curve | demand schedule]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. It plots the price on the vertical (y) axis and the [[effects of price changes on quantity demanded | quantity demanded]] on the horizontal (x) axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. The curve connects the points from the demand schedule, showing a continuous relationship between price and quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

> [!tip] Movement Along vs. Shift of the Curve
> When only the price changes, and everything else remains constant, this results in a **movement along** the existing demand curve, representing a change in the [[effects of price changes on quantity demanded | quantity demanded]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
>
> If other factors (like consumer income, tastes, or prices of related goods) change, the entire demand relationship shifts, causing the **entire demand curve to shift** to a new position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

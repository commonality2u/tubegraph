When simplifying radicals, the goal is often to extract [[perfect_square_identification | perfect square factors]] from the number under the radical sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. This process relies heavily on recognizing what constitutes a [[perfect_square_identification | perfect square]] and identifying them as [[finding_common_factors | factors]] of a given number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

## What is a Perfect Square?

A [[perfect_square_identification | perfect square]] is an integer that is the square of another integer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. For example, 36 is a [[perfect_square_identification | perfect square]] because its [[square_roots_and_perfect_squares | square root]] is 6 (6 x 6 = 36) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Similarly, 25 is a [[perfect_square_identification | perfect square]] because its [[square_roots_and_perfect_squares | square root]] is 5 (5 x 5 = 25) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## Examples of Perfect Squares

Common [[perfect_square_identification | perfect squares]] include:
*   1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>
*   4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>
*   9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>
*   16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>
*   25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>
*   36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>
*   49 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>
*   64 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>

And so on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Familiarity with these numbers is key to efficient simplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

## How to Recognize Perfect Squares for Simplification

When simplifying a radical, the strategy is to find the largest [[perfect_square_identification | perfect square]] that is a [[finding_common_factors | factor]] of the number under the radical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### Examples:
*   **Square root of 72**: 72 can be factored into 36 times 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Since 36 is a [[perfect_square_identification | perfect square]] (6 x 6), the [[square_roots_and_perfect_squares | square root]] of 72 simplifies to 6 times the [[square_roots_and_perfect_squares | square root]] of 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Square root of 50**: 50 can be factored into 25 times 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. 25 is the largest [[perfect_square_identification | perfect square]] [[finding_common_factors | factor]] of 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. This simplifies to 5 times the [[square_roots_and_perfect_squares | square root]] of 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Choosing [[finding_common_factors | factors]] like 5 and 10 for 50 would not be as helpful because neither are [[perfect_square_identification | perfect squares]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **Square root of 27**: 27 has 9 as a [[perfect_square_identification | perfect square]] [[finding_common_factors | factor]] (9 x 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This simplifies to 3 times the [[square_roots_and_perfect_squares | square root]] of 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **Square root of 18**: 18 has 9 as a [[perfect_square_identification | perfect square]] [[finding_common_factors | factor]] (9 x 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. This simplifies to 3 times the [[square_roots_and_perfect_squares | square root]] of 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Square root of 25**: When the entire number under the radical is a [[perfect_square_identification | perfect square]], simply calculate its [[square_roots_and_perfect_squares | square root]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. The [[square_roots_and_perfect_squares | square root]] of 25 is 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
*   **Square root of 29**: If a number like 29 (a prime number) has no [[perfect_square_identification | perfect square]] [[finding_common_factors | factors]] other than 1, it cannot be simplified further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

For larger numbers, you may need to simplify in steps. For instance, with the [[square_roots_and_perfect_squares | square root]] of 320, one might first recognize 16 as a [[perfect_square_identification | perfect square]] [[finding_common_factors | factor]] (16 x 20) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. This would yield 4 times the [[square_roots_and_perfect_squares | square root]] of 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Since 20 still contains a [[perfect_square_identification | perfect square]] [[finding_common_factors | factor]] (4 x 5), further simplification is possible, resulting in 2 times the [[square_roots_and_perfect_squares | square root]] of 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. The overall result would be 56 times the [[square_roots_and_perfect_squares | square root]] of 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. The process continues until the number under the radical has no remaining [[perfect_square_identification | perfect square]] [[finding_common_factors | factors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

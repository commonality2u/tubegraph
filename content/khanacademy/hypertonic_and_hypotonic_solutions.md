Solutions are fundamental in chemistry and biology, composed of a solvent and a solute. The interaction and movement of these components, particularly in differing concentrations, are crucial to understanding processes like diffusion and osmosis.

## [[definition_and_role_of_solvent_and_solute | Definition of Solvent and Solute]]

A [[definition_and_role_of_solvent_and_solute | solution]] is formed when one substance is dissolved into another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.
*   The **solvent** is the substance present in greater quantity, which does the dissolving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. In many biological and chemical systems, water is the most common solvent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
*   The **solute** is the substance present in lesser quantity, which gets dissolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. For example, in sugar water, water is the solvent and sugar is the solute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

### Concentration

**Concentration** measures how much of a particular particle exists per unit of space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. A high concentration means many particles in a given space, while a low concentration means few particles in the same space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

## Diffusion

**Diffusion** is the process where particles or molecules spread from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. This occurs due to the random kinetic energy and movement of molecules, leading to a net spread until concentrations are roughly equal throughout the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

## Hypertonic and Hypotonic Solutions

These terms describe the relative concentrations of solutes between two solutions.
*   A **hypertonic solution** has a higher concentration of solute relative to another solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
*   A **hypotonic solution** has a lower concentration of solute relative to another solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

In the context of diffusion without barriers, solutes will move from a hypertonic area (high solute concentration) to a hypotonic area (low solute concentration) to achieve equilibrium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

## [[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | Osmosis]]: Diffusion of Water

[[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | Osmosis]] is a specific type of diffusion: the diffusion of water (or another solvent) across a [[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | semi-permeable membrane]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>.
*   A **[[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | semi-permeable membrane]]** allows certain molecules (like water) to pass through but blocks others (like larger solute molecules) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. An example could be a [[cellular_structure_and_functions | cell membrane]].

When a semi-permeable membrane separates a hypertonic solution from a hypotonic solution, the solute cannot diffuse to equalize concentrations. Instead, the solvent (water) moves to achieve this balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.
*   Water will move from the hypotonic solution (where water concentration is higher, relative to solute) into the hypertonic solution (where water concentration is lower, relative to solute) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.
*   This net inward flow of water into the area of higher solute concentration attempts to dilute the hypertonic solution and equalize the concentrations on both sides of the membrane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.
*   This movement is driven by probabilities: water molecules on the hypertonic side are more likely to be blocked by solute molecules when trying to exit, while water molecules on the hypotonic side face fewer obstacles entering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.

This article explains the concepts of hypertonic and hypotonic solutions, building upon the fundamental definitions of solvents, solutes, and diffusion, leading into the process of osmosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Basic Definitions: Solvent, Solute, and Solution

In a mixture within a container, the component present in a larger quantity is called the [[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | solvent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. For example, in a mixture of water and sugar, water molecules are typically the [[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | solvent]] because there are many more of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The component present in a smaller quantity is known as the [[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | solute]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. In the water and sugar example, sugar is the [[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | solute]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, which is dissolved into the [[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | solvent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. The combination of the [[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | solvent]] and [[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | solute]] molecules forms a [[functionbased_solutions_to_differential_equations | solution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Water is the most common [[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | solvent]] in biological and chemical systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

## Diffusion and Concentration

[[concentration_gradients_and_equilibrium | Concentration]] refers to the amount of a particular particle per unit space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. When there are many particles in a given space, it's a high [[concentration_gradients_and_equilibrium | concentration]]; when there are few, it's a low [[concentration_gradients_and_equilibrium | concentration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

Diffusion is the natural spreading of particles or molecules from an area of high [[concentration_gradients_and_equilibrium | concentration]] to an area of low [[concentration_gradients_and_equilibrium | concentration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. This occurs due to the random kinetic energy of molecules, causing them to move and spread out until they reach a state of [[concentration_gradients_and_equilibrium | equilibrium]] where concentrations are roughly equal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

### Hypertonic and Hypotonic Solutions

These terms describe the relative [[concentration_gradients_and_equilibrium | concentration]] of a [[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | solute]] in one [[functionbased_solutions_to_differential_equations | solution]] compared to another:

*   **Hypertonic solution**: A [[functionbased_solutions_to_differential_equations | solution]] with a higher [[concentration_gradients_and_equilibrium | concentration]] of [[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | solute]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   **Hypotonic solution**: A [[functionbased_solutions_to_differential_equations | solution]] with a lower [[concentration_gradients_and_equilibrium | concentration]] of [[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | solute]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

In a system where [[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | solute]] particles can move freely, they will diffuse from a hypertonic (high [[concentration_gradients_and_equilibrium | concentration]]) area to a hypotonic (low [[concentration_gradients_and_equilibrium | concentration]]) area to achieve [[concentration_gradients_and_equilibrium | equilibrium]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

## Osmosis: Diffusion of Water

[[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | Osmosis]] is a specific type of diffusion, defined as the diffusion of water (the [[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | solvent]]) through a [[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | semi-permeable membrane]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>. A [[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | semi-permeable membrane]] allows certain molecules, like water, to pass through, but blocks larger molecules, such as [[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | solute]]s like sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

When a [[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | semi-permeable membrane]] separates a hypertonic [[functionbased_solutions_to_differential_equations | solution]] (high [[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | solute]] [[concentration_gradients_and_equilibrium | concentration]]) from a hypotonic [[functionbased_solutions_to_differential_equations | solution]] (low [[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | solute]] [[concentration_gradients_and_equilibrium | concentration]]), the [[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | solute]] molecules cannot move to [[concentration_gradients_and_equilibrium | equalize]] the [[concentration_gradients_and_equilibrium | concentrations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. Instead, water molecules move across the membrane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. Water will flow from the hypotonic side (where there's a lower [[concentration_gradients_and_equilibrium | concentration]] of [[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | solute]], and thus a higher relative [[concentration_gradients_and_equilibrium | concentration]] of water) to the hypertonic side (where there's a higher [[concentration_gradients_and_equilibrium | concentration]] of [[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | solute]], and thus a lower relative [[concentration_gradients_and_equilibrium | concentration]] of water) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. This net flow of water continues until the [[concentration_gradients_and_equilibrium | concentrations]] of [[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | solute]] on both sides are as close as possible, attempting to reach [[concentration_gradients_and_equilibrium | equilibrium]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.

[[photosynthesis_process_overview | Photosynthesis]] is a fundamental biological process vital for life on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. It is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria utilize carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight to produce sugars (carbohydrates) and oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. The resulting carbohydrates serve as fuel for living organisms, while the oxygen is essential for processes like cellular respiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

The overall [[photosynthesis_chemical_equation | chemical equation]] for [[photosynthesis_process_overview | photosynthesis]] can be generally represented as <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>:

CO₂ (carbon dioxide) + H₂O (water) + Photons (sunlight) → (CH₂O)n (carbohydrate) + O₂ (oxygen) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>

This complex process is typically broken down into two main stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>:

## Light-Dependent Reactions

The light-dependent reactions are the first stage of [[photosynthesis_process_overview | photosynthesis]] and directly require sunlight (photons) to occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

*   **Inputs**: Photons from sunlight and water (H₂O) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. In these reactions, photons excite electrons in chlorophyll, which then move to a high energy state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **Outputs**:
    *   **Oxygen (O₂)**: Molecular oxygen is released as a byproduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
    *   [[role_of_atp_and_nadph_in_photosynthesis | **ATP**]]: Adenosine Triphosphate, the primary energy currency of the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. Energy is harnessed as electrons transition from a high to a lower energy state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
    *   [[role_of_atp_and_nadph_in_photosynthesis | **NADPH**]]: Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate, a molecule similar to NADH seen in cellular respiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. [[oxidation_and_reduction_processes_in_the_electron_transport_chain | NADPH]] acts as a reducing agent, meaning it can donate a hydrogen and an associated electron to other molecules, causing them to be reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. This transfer of electrons to a lower energy state also provides energy for the subsequent reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

## Light-Independent Reactions (Calvin Cycle)

The light-independent reactions, often referred to as the Calvin Cycle, are the second stage of [[photosynthesis_process_overview | photosynthesis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. Although they do not directly require photons, they still occur when the sun is out because they depend on the products generated during the light-dependent reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. For this reason, a more accurate term is "light-independent reactions" rather than "dark reactions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

*   **Inputs**:
    *   [[role_of_atp_and_nadph_in_photosynthesis | ATP]] and [[role_of_atp_and_nadph_in_photosynthesis | NADPH]] (from the light reactions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
    *   Carbon dioxide (CO₂) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. This is where the carbons come from to build the sugar molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.
*   **Outputs**:
    *   **Phosphoglyceraldehyde (PGAL) / Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P)**: These are three-carbon molecules which serve as the basic building blocks for other carbohydrates, including glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. Two PGAL/G3P molecules can be combined to produce glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

The [[photosynthesis_process_overview | overall process of photosynthesis]] can be summarized as follows: light-dependent reactions take in photons and water, releasing oxygen and producing [[role_of_atp_and_nadph_in_photosynthesis | ATP]] and [[role_of_atp_and_nadph_in_photosynthesis | NADPH]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. These [[role_of_atp_and_nadph_in_photosynthesis | ATP]] and [[role_of_atp_and_nadph_in_photosynthesis | NADPH]] molecules then power the light-independent reactions, which also take in carbon dioxide, to produce carbohydrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

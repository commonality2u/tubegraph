Photosynthesis is a fundamental biological process vital for life on Earth, primarily carried out by plants, bacteria, and algae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. It is the process by which these organisms convert carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight into [[Calvin Cycle and Carbohydrate Production | sugars]] or [[Calvin Cycle and Carbohydrate Production | carbohydrates]] and oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

This process is critical for living species for two main reasons:
*   **Carbohydrate Production** We need [[Calvin Cycle and Carbohydrate Production | carbohydrates]] or [[Calvin Cycle and Carbohydrate Production | sugars]] to fuel our bodies, generating [[Role of ATP and NADPH in Photosynthesis | ATP]] through cellular respiration from glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Oxygen Release** We breathe oxygen to break down glucose and perform cellular respiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

Plants harness the energy from photons released by the sun, converting it into [[Calvin Cycle and Carbohydrate Production | sugars]] that serve as fuel for animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## General Photosynthesis Equation

The overall equation for photosynthesis is:
`nCO2 + nH2O + photons â†’ (CH2O)n + nO2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>

Where:
*   `CO2` is carbon dioxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   `H2O` is water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   `photons` represent sunlight, which excite [[Electrons and chemical reactions | electrons]] in chlorophyll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   `(CH2O)n` is a general term for [[Calvin Cycle and Carbohydrate Production | carbohydrates]], where `n` is typically at least three; for glucose, `n` is 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   `O2` is molecular oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

While this equation provides an overview, the process of [[Photosynthesis Equation and Process | photosynthesis]] does not happen directly in one step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Instead, it occurs through a series of steps organized into two main stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

## Two Stages of Photosynthesis

Photosynthesis can be broadly divided into two stages:
1.  Light-dependent reactions (Light Reactions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>
2.  Light-independent reactions (Dark Reactions / [[Calvin Cycle and Carbohydrate Production | Calvin Cycle]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>

### Light-dependent Reactions
The light-dependent reactions require sunlight (photons) to occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   **Inputs**: Photons and water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   **Outputs**: Oxygen, [[Role of ATP and NADPH in Photosynthesis | ATP]], and [[Role of ATP and NADPH in Photosynthesis | NADPH]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
    *   [[Role of ATP and NADPH in Photosynthesis | ATP]] serves as the biological currency of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
    *   [[Role of ATP and NADPH in Photosynthesis | NADPH]] is a reducing agent, similar to [[Role of NAD and NADH in glycolysis | NADH]] in cellular respiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. It can give away a hydrogen and its associated [[Electrons and chemical reactions | electron]], reducing another molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. The energy released as the [[Electrons and chemical reactions | electron]] moves to a lower energy state is utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

### Light-independent Reactions (Calvin Cycle)
The light-independent reactions, often called the [[Calvin Cycle and Carbohydrate Production | Calvin Cycle]], do not directly require photons, but they still occur during daylight hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. They rely on the byproducts (ATP and NADPH) from the light reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
*   **Inputs**: [[Role of ATP and NADPH in Photosynthesis | ATP]], [[Role of ATP and NADPH in Photosynthesis | NADPH]], and carbon dioxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.
*   **Outputs**: Phosphoglyceraldehyde (PGAL) or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
    *   PGAL/G3P is a three-carbon molecule that serves as a building block for other [[Calvin Cycle and Carbohydrate Production | carbohydrates]], including glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. Two PGAL molecules can combine to produce glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
    *   This is the reverse of [[Functional steps and enzymes involved in glycolysis | glycolysis]], where glucose is split into two G3P molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.

In summary, the light reactions take in photons and water, releasing oxygen, [[Role of ATP and NADPH in Photosynthesis | ATP]], and [[Role of ATP and NADPH in Photosynthesis | NADPH]]. The dark reactions (Calvin Cycle) then use these products along with carbon dioxide to synthesize basic [[Calvin Cycle and Carbohydrate Production | carbohydrate]] building blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

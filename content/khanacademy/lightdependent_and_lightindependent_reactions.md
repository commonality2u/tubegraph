Photosynthesis is a crucial biological process, considered one of the most important for sustaining life on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. It is primarily associated with plants, but also occurs in bacteria and algae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

In simple terms, [[basic_concept_of_photosynthesis | photosynthesis]] is the process where plants take carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight to produce sugars (carbohydrates) and oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

This process provides two vital components for oxygen-breathing life forms:
*   **Carbohydrates/Sugars**: These fuel our bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. In [[cellular_respiration_process | cellular respiration]], glucose (a broken-down carbohydrate) is used to generate ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Oxygen**: Essential for us to breathe and break down glucose during [[cellular_respiration_process | cellular respiration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

The general chemical equation for [[understanding_chemical_equations_and_reactions | photosynthesis]] is:
`nCO₂ + nH₂O + Photons → (CH₂O)n + nO₂` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
Here, `(CH₂O)n` represents a general carbohydrate, where 'n' can be a multiple, such as 6 for glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

## Two Stages of Photosynthesis

[[detailed_process_of_photosynthesis | Photosynthesis]] does not occur directly in one step, but rather through a series of reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. It can be broken down into two main stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>:

1.  **Light-Dependent Reactions**
2.  **Light-Independent Reactions (or Dark Reactions)**

### Light-Dependent Reactions

The light-dependent reactions are accurately named because they require sunlight (photons) to occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

*   **Inputs**: Photons and water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   **Outputs**: Molecular oxygen (O₂) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>, and energy-carrying molecules: ATP and NADPH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

Photons excite electrons in chlorophyll, which then move to a higher energy state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. As these electrons return to a lower energy state, their energy is harnessed to produce ATP and NADPH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

> ### Reminder: OIL RIG
> *   **O**xidation **I**s **L**osing an electron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
> *   **R**eduction **I**s **G**aining an electron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
> *   NADPH acts as a reducing agent, meaning it gives away its hydrogen and associated electron, thereby reducing other molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. This energy release from electrons moving to lower energy states is crucial for the subsequent reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

### Light-Independent Reactions (Dark Reactions / [[calvin_cycle_and_carbohydrate_production | Calvin Cycle]])

These reactions are often called "dark reactions," but this is a misleading name because they *do* occur in the light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. A more accurate term is "light-independent reactions," as they do not directly require photons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. However, they rely on the ATP and NADPH produced by the light-dependent reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

*   **Inputs**: Carbon dioxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>, ATP, and NADPH (from the light reactions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
*   **Process**: For most plants, this stage is known as the [[calvin_cycle_and_carbohydrate_production | Calvin Cycle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
*   **Outputs**: It produces phosphoglyceraldehyde (PGAL) or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. This molecule is a simple three-carbon building block that can then be used to produce other carbohydrates, including glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. Two PGAL/G3P molecules can be combined to produce glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

This building process in photosynthesis is the reverse of what happens in [[steps_and_reactions_in_glycolysis | glycolysis]], where glucose is split into similar molecules for energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.

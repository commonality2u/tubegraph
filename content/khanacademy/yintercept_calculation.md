The y-intercept of a linear equation is the point where the line crosses the y-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. This means that at the y-intercept, the x-coordinate is always zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

## Identifying the Y-intercept

To find the y-intercept for any linear equation, the easiest method is to set the value of x to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.

### In Slope-Intercept Form

The [[slopeintercept_form | slope-intercept form]] of a linear equation (y = mx + b) makes the y-intercept particularly easy to identify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. In this form, the 'b' value directly represents the y-coordinate of the y-intercept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>. The y-intercept is always the point (0, b) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>.

#### Example 1: y = 2x + 3

Consider the linear equation y = 2x + 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
1.  **Set x to zero**: If x is equal to zero, the term "2x" becomes zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.
2.  **Solve for y**: This leaves y = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.
3.  **Identify the point**: Therefore, the y-intercept is the point (0, 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

#### Example 2: y = -x + 2

Consider another linear equation, y = -x + 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>.
1.  **Direct identification**: Immediately, based on the [[slopeintercept_form | slope-intercept form]], the y-intercept is the point (0, 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>.

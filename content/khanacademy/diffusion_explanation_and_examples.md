This article explores the concept of diffusion, a fundamental process in chemistry and biology, along with related terms such as solvent, solute, solution, and the specific case of osmosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Basic Concepts: Solvent, Solute, Solution

To understand diffusion, it's helpful to first define some basic terms related to mixtures:

*   **Solvent**: The substance present in a greater quantity within a mixture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. In a common example, water often acts as the solvent due to its abundance in many biological and chemical systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The solvent is considered the "thing doing the dissolving" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   **Solute**: The substance present in a lesser quantity within a mixture that is dissolved into the solvent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. For example, if sugar is added to water, the sugar molecules are the solute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Solution**: The combination of a solvent and a solute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. When sugar is dissolved in water, the resulting mixture is a sugar solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## What is Diffusion?

Diffusion is the process by which particles or molecules spread out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. This spreading occurs from areas of [[role_of_concentration_gradients_in_diffusion_and_osmosis | high concentration]] to areas of [[role_of_concentration_gradients_in_diffusion_and_osmosis | low concentration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. The movement is not directed by any inherent knowledge of the system, but rather by the random collisions and kinetic energy of the molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Over time, this random movement leads to a more even distribution of particles, tending towards a state of equilibrium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

### Examples of Diffusion

1.  **Gases in a Container**: Imagine a container with gaseous oxygen concentrated in one corner and the rest of the container as a vacuum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Due to their kinetic energy, the oxygen molecules are constantly moving and bumping into each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Since there's nothing to bump into in the empty space, the molecules are more likely to move into that unoccupied region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Eventually, the oxygen molecules will spread out relatively evenly throughout the entire container <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
2.  **Sugar in Water**: Consider a container of water with a partition in the middle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. If sugar molecules are initially dissolved only on one side of the partition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>, and the partition allows sugar molecules to pass through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, the sugar molecules will gradually spread to the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Over time, the concentration of sugar will become roughly equal on both sides of the container <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

### Concentration and Diffusion

Concentration refers to the amount of a particular particle or substance per unit of space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Diffusion inherently involves the movement of particles down their [[role_of_concentration_gradients_in_diffusion_and_osmosis | concentration gradient]] â€“ from where there's a lot of them to where there's less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

### Hypertonic and Hypotonic Solutions

These terms describe the relative concentrations of solutes in solutions:

*   **Hypertonic solution**: A solution with a high concentration of solute relative to another solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. The prefix "hyper-" implies having a lot or too much of something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
*   **Hypotonic solution**: A solution with a low concentration of solute relative to another solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. The prefix "hypo-" implies not enough of something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

In general, diffusion causes solutes to move from a hypertonic solution to a hypotonic solution, if there are no barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

## Diffusion vs. Osmosis

While diffusion refers to the general spreading of any particles, [[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | osmosis]] is a specific type of diffusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.

*   **Osmosis**: The diffusion of water (or any solvent) through a [[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | semi-permeable membrane]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. A [[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | semi-permeable membrane]] allows certain molecules (like water) to pass through but blocks others (like larger solute molecules) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

In osmosis, even though the solute cannot move to equalize concentrations, the solvent (water) will move to try to achieve equilibrium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. For instance, if a [[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | semi-permeable membrane]] separates a hypertonic sugar solution from a hypotonic pure water solution, water molecules are more likely to move from the hypotonic side (higher water concentration, lower solute concentration) into the hypertonic side (lower water concentration, higher solute concentration) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>. This net flow of water continues until concentrations are as balanced as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.

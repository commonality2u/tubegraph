## Early Challenges in Car Manufacturing
Even for an established manufacturer like Tesla, the process of car production is fraught with complexities. [[Elon Musks ventures into electric vehicles space exploration and internet companies | Elon Musk]] recounted a day at the Tesla factory in Fremont where production was halted due to a missing $3 USB cable, essential for the wiring harness and interior assembly of vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This minor component, supplied from China, faced significant supply chain issues including slow shipping, customs delays due to being grouped with other companies' non-compliant items, and credit limit issues on expedited orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Such incidents highlight the intricate [[challenges_and_intricacies_of_car_manufacturing_and_supply_chain_management | challenges and intricacies of car manufacturing and supply chain management]] that can impede production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Founding Vision
Elon Musk's initial interest in electric cars stemmed from a college contemplation of areas that would most profoundly affect the future of humanity. Among the internet and space exploration, sustainable energy stood out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. He initially focused on advanced capacitors with energy densities exceeding batteries, hoping to leverage chip-making equipment to create precise capacitors at a molecular level for energy storage in electric cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

## Tesla's Catalytic Mission
Tesla's primary objective is to accelerate the transition to sustainable transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>. Musk believes this shift is inevitable out of necessity, but current market forces are not functioning properly due to the "un-priced externality" of gasoline, which does not account for the environmental impacts of CO2 in oceans and the atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:55">[00:30:55]</a>. Tesla aims to act as a catalyst, accelerating these market forces by approximately 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>.

> "The goal of Tesla is to try to act as a catalyst to accelerate those sort of normal forces... And try to make it happen, I don't know, maybe 10 years sooner than it would otherwise occur." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>

## Impact and Future Outlook
Tesla's strategy involves producing more electric cars and continually driving down their price point until the automotive industry is "very firmly electric" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>. Tesla's success is evident as the Model S has led its segment in sales, surpassing established luxury brands like Mercedes S-Class, BMW 7 Series, and Lexus LS400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>.

Beyond its own vehicle production, Tesla also supplies powertrains to other major car manufacturers like Toyota and Mercedes, further accelerating the broader industry's adoption of electric vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:43">[00:31:43]</a>.

### The "Victory Condition"
Musk defines the "victory condition" for Tesla as reaching a point where approximately half of all new cars manufactured are electric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>. He conservatively estimates this could happen within 17 years from 2013, with a more optimistic prediction of 13 or 14 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:42">[00:33:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:54">[00:33:54]</a>.

### Technology Adoption and Energy Storage
Musk explains that new technology adoption typically follows an S-curve, where initial predictions are often underestimated, and mid-point predictions can be overestimated before stabilizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>. He expresses excitement about the pace of technology improvement in electric energy storage, noting it is progressing faster than many realize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>. This rapid advancement is crucial for realizing Tesla's long-term goals and the broader shift to sustainable transport.

Before delving into the specifics of meiosis, it's helpful to provide a high-level comparison between [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]] and [[overview_of_meiosis | meiosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. These are two fundamental processes of [[cell_division_in_somatic_and_germ_cells | cell division]] with distinct outcomes and purposes in organisms.

## [[overview_of_mitosis | Mitosis]]

[[overview_of_mitosis | Mitosis]] is a cyclical process where a single cell divides into two genetically identical daughter cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

*   **Starting Cell**: A diploid cell, represented as 2n, meaning it has two sets of chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.
    *   For human beings, this means starting with 46 chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. These consist of 23 chromosomes from one parent and 23 from the other, forming 23 [[role_of_homologous_pairs_in_meiosis | homologous pairs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>.
*   **Process**: After interphase where DNA is replicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>, the cell undergoes [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]].
*   **Result**: Two cells, each with the same genetic information and diploid number (2n) of chromosomes as the original cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>.
*   **Purpose**: [[overview_of_mitosis | Mitosis]] is how most of the cells in your body grow and divide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. It's responsible for turning a single cell into a complex organism and for growth and repair throughout life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.
*   **Location**: This process occurs in [[cell_division_in_somatic_and_germ_cells | somatic cells]], which make up the bulk of the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.
*   **Cycle**: The daughter cells produced can go through interphase and [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]] again, making it a continuous cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

## [[overview_of_meiosis | Meiosis]]

[[overview_of_meiosis | Meiosis]] is a two-phase process that produces genetically distinct cells with half the number of chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

*   **Starting Cell**: A diploid cell (2n) with a diploid number of chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. Similar to [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]], DNA replication occurs during interphase before meiosis begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.
*   **Phases**: [[phases_of_meiosis | Meiosis]] occurs in two main phases:
    *   **[[phases_of_meiosis | Meiosis One]]**: The cell undergoes [[phases_of_meiosis | Meiosis One]], resulting in two cells that now have a haploid (n) number of chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.
        *   For humans, the 46 chromosomes in the initial cell become 23 chromosomes in each of these two nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.
        *   This phase involves splitting the [[role_of_homologous_pairs_in_meiosis | homologous pairs]] of chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. The distribution of chromosomes from parental origins into the new cells is random <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.
    *   **[[phases_of_meiosis | Meiosis Two]]**: Each of the two cells from [[phases_of_meiosis | Meiosis One]] then goes through [[phases_of_meiosis | Meiosis Two]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. This phase is similar to [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]], but it starts with cells that are already haploid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.
*   **Result**: Four cells, each with a haploid (n) number of chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. These cells are not necessarily genetically identical due to the random splitting of [[role_of_homologous_pairs_in_meiosis | homologous pairs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.
*   **Purpose**: The primary purpose of [[overview_of_meiosis | meiosis]] is the production of gametes, or sex cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. These cells are used for fertilization in [[role_of_mitosis_and_meiosis_in_human_reproduction | sexual reproduction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>.
    *   In males, this process occurs in the testes to produce sperm cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>.
    *   In females, it occurs in the ovaries to produce egg cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.
    *   In plants, it produces pollen or ovules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.
*   **Location**: [[overview_of_meiosis | Meiosis]] takes place in [[cell_division_in_somatic_and_germ_cells | germ cells]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a> (testes in males, ovaries in females) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. [[cell_division_in_somatic_and_germ_cells | Germ cells]] can also undergo [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]] to produce more diploid [[cell_division_in_somatic_and_germ_cells | germ cells]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.
*   **Cycle**: [[overview_of_meiosis | Meiosis]] is not a cycle in the same way [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]] is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. The resulting gametes are specialized cells designed for fertilization and do not typically undergo further [[cell_division_in_somatic_and_germ_cells | cell division]] on their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>. When two gametes fuse during fertilization, they form a fertilized egg which then undergoes [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]] to develop into a new organism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.

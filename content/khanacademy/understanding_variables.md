In basic arithmetic, you typically deal with concrete numbers, such as 23 + 5 or 2 × 7, where the exact values are known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. As you move into the algebraic world, you begin to encounter variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

A variable is a value within an expression that has the ability to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The value a variable takes depends on the specific context of the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Variables in Expressions

An expression is a statement representing a value or a quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The value of an expression changes depending on the value of the variable(s) within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

For example, consider the expression `x + 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>:
*   If `x` equals 1, then `x + 5` evaluates to 1 + 5 = 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   If `x` equals -7, then `x + 5` evaluates to -7 + 5 = -2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

Expressions can also contain multiple variables, such as `y + z` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Its value depends on the values assigned to `y` and `z` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## Variables in Equations

An equation is formed when two expressions are set equal to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

```
Expression = Expression
```

Equations can constrain the possible values a variable can take <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

For instance, in the equation `x + 3 = 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>:
*   With only one unknown variable (`x`) and one equation, you can determine the specific value `x` must be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. In this case, `x` must be -2 (-2 + 3 = 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This process involves [[isolating_the_variable_in_an_equation | isolating the variable]].

Equations can also have multiple variables, like `x + y + z = 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. While the equation itself introduces constraints, the specific values of the variables might not be uniquely determined unless other variables are known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. For example, if `y = 3` and `z = 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>:
*   The equation becomes `x + 3 + 2 = 5`, which simplifies to `x + 5 = 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   This constrains `x` to be 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

## Evaluating Expressions with Variables

To emphasize how a variable's value changes with context, consider evaluating expressions by substituting different values for the variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

**Example 1: `x` to the `y` power (`x^y`)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>
*   If `x = 5` and `y = 2`, the expression evaluates to `5^2 = 25` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   If `x = -2` and `y = 3`, the expression evaluates to `(-2)^3 = -2 × -2 × -2 = -8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

**Example 2: Square root of (`x + y`) minus `x` (`√(x + y) - x`)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>
*   If `x = 1` and `y = 8`, substitute these values into the expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
    *   `√(1 + 8) - 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>
    *   `√9 - 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>
    *   `3 - 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>
    *   The expression evaluates to 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

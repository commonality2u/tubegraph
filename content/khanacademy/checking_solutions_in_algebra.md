One of the beneficial aspects of [[algebraic_techniques_for_solving_equations | algebra]] is the ability to verify the correctness of a solution. This process involves substituting the obtained value for the variable back into the original [[solving_algebraic_equations | equation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. If both sides of the [[solving_algebraic_equations | equation]] remain equal after the substitution, then the solution is correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

## How to Check a Solution

To check a solution for an [[solving_algebraic_equations | equation]]:
1.  Take the value you found for the [[isolating_variables_in_algebraic_equations | variable]] (e.g., x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
2.  Substitute this value into the original [[solving_algebraic_equations | equation]] wherever the [[isolating_variables_in_algebraic_equations | variable]] appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
3.  Simplify both sides of the [[solving_algebraic_equations | equation]].
4.  If the left side equals the right side, your solution is correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

## Examples

### Example 1: Solving 5x = 20

For the simple [[solving_algebraic_equations | equation]] `5x = 20`, it can be determined mentally that x equals 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   **Original [[solving_algebraic_equations | equation]]:** `5x = 20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>
*   **Solution:** `x = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>
*   **Check:**
    *   Substitute `4` for `x`: `5 * 4 = 20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>
    *   Simplify: `20 = 20`
    *   Since both sides are equal, the solution is correct.

### Example 2: Solving -3/4x = 10/13

Consider the more complex [[solving_algebraic_equations | equation]] `-3/4x = 10/13` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **Original [[solving_algebraic_equations | equation]]:** `-3/4x = 10/13` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>
*   **Solution:** `x = -40/39` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>
*   **Check:**
    *   Substitute `-40/39` for `x`: `-3/4 * (-40/39) = 10/13` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>
    *   Simplify the left side by canceling common factors:
        *   Divide 40 by 4 to get 10, and 4 by 4 to get 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
        *   Divide 39 by 3 to get 13, and 3 by 3 to get 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
        *   The expression becomes `(-1/1) * (-10/13)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
    *   Multiply: `(-1) * (-10) = 10` and `1 * 13 = 13`. So the left side becomes `10/13` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
    *   Result: `10/13 = 10/13` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>
    *   Since both sides are equal, the solution is correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

### Example 3: Solving -5/6x = 7/8

For the [[solving_algebraic_equations | equation]] `-5/6x = 7/8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
*   **Original [[solving_algebraic_equations | equation]]:** `-5/6x = 7/8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>
*   **Solution:** `x = -21/20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>
*   **Check:**
    *   Substitute `-21/20` for `x`: `-5/6 * (-21/20) = 7/8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>
    *   Simplify the left side by canceling common factors:
        *   Divide 5 and 20 by 5: 5 becomes 1, 20 becomes 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
        *   Divide 6 and 21 by 3: 6 becomes 2, 21 becomes 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
        *   The expression becomes `(-1/2) * (-7/4)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
    *   Multiply: `(-1) * (-7) = 7` and `2 * 4 = 8`. So the left side becomes `7/8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
    *   Result: `7/8 = 7/8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>
    *   Since both sides are equal, the solution is correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

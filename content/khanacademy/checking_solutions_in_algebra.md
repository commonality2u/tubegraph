One of the advantageous aspects of [[algebraic_methods_in_algebra | algebra]] is the ability to verify solutions obtained for an equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. By substituting the calculated value back into the original equation, one can confirm the accuracy of the answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

## Method for Checking Solutions

The process involves:
1.  **Substitution**: Replace the variable (e.g., `x`) in the original equation with the calculated numerical solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
2.  **Calculation**: Perform the arithmetic operations on both sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
3.  **Verification**: Confirm that both sides of the equation are equal, which indicates the solution is correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

## Examples

### Example 1: Confirming a Fractional Solution

Consider the equation: `-3/4 * x = 10/13` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
After solving, if `x = -40/39` is found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, the check proceeds as follows:

```
Original Equation: -3/4 * x = 10/13
Substitute x = -40/39: -3/4 * (-40/39) = 10/13
```
When multiplying fractions, common factors can be simplified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>:
*   Divide 4 into 40 (4 becomes 1, 40 becomes 10) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   The product of a negative and a negative number is positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
*   Multiply the numerators: 3 * 10 = 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
*   Multiply the denominators: 1 * 39 = 39 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
The result is `30/39`. This fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>:
`30 / 3 = 10`
`39 / 3 = 13`
Thus, the left side becomes `10/13` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. Since `10/13` equals `10/13`, the solution `x = -40/39` is confirmed as correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

### Example 2: Verifying Another Fractional Solution

Consider the equation: `-5/6x = 7/8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
If the solution found is `x = -21/20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>, the verification process is:

```
Original Equation: -5/6 * x = 7/8
Substitute x = -21/20: -5/6 * (-21/20) = 7/8
```
Similar to the previous example, simplify by canceling common factors and multiplying:
*   Divide 5 into 20 (5 becomes 1, 20 becomes 4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   Divide 6 into 21 (both divisible by 3; 6 becomes 2, 21 becomes 7) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
*   The product of two negative numbers is positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
*   Multiply the remaining numerators: 1 * 7 = 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
*   Multiply the remaining denominators: 2 * 4 = 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
The left side evaluates to `7/8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Since `7/8` matches the right side of the original equation, the solution `x = -21/20` is correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

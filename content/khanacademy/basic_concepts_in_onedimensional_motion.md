This article introduces the fundamental differences between vectors and scalars, and applies these concepts to describe motion in one dimension, specifically distinguishing between distance and displacement, and speed and velocity. These ideas, while sounding complicated, are actually very simple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Vectors and Scalars

The core distinction between these two types of quantities lies in whether they include a direction:
*   A **vector** is a quantity that possesses both a magnitude (or size) and a direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   A **scalar** is a quantity that only has a magnitude (or size) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

Examples will clarify these definitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Distance vs. Displacement

Consider moving a brick from one point to another on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. If the brick is moved 5 meters, this measurement alone only tells you the size or magnitude of the movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

*   **Distance (Scalar Quantity)**:
    *   When you only state the extent of a movement, such as "5 meters," without specifying direction, it is a scalar quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
    *   This is known as **distance** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
    *   Knowing only the distance (e.g., 5 meters) does not tell you if the movement was to the right, left, up, down, in, or out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
    *   For example, a brick has moved a distance of 5 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

*   **Displacement (Vector Quantity)**:
    *   If you specify both the magnitude and the direction of the change in position, such as "5 meters to the right," this is a vector quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
    *   The 5 meters is the magnitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, and "to the right" is the direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
    *   This vector version of distance is called **displacement** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
    *   For example, a brick has been displaced 5 meters to the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

## Speed vs. Velocity

Building on the brick example, if the 5-meter movement occurred over a duration of 2 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>, we can calculate how fast the brick moved.

*   **Speed (Scalar Quantity)**:
    *   Speed tells you how fast something went <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
    *   Calculated as distance divided by time (e.g., 5 meters / 2 seconds = 2.5 meters per second) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
    *   Since it does not include direction, it is a scalar quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
    *   For example, the speed of the brick is 2.5 meters per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

*   **Velocity (Vector Quantity)**:
    *   Velocity specifies both the speed and the direction of motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
    *   Calculated as displacement divided by time (e.g., 5 meters to the right / 2 seconds = 2.5 meters per second to the right) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
    *   Because it includes both magnitude (2.5 meters per second) and direction (to the right), it is a vector quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
    *   For example, the velocity of the brick is 2.5 meters per second to the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

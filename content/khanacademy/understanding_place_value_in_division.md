When performing division, especially with larger numbers, understanding place value is crucial for correctly setting up and solving problems. It ensures that the digits in the quotient accurately reflect their value.

### Importance of [[importance_of_multiplication_tables_in_division | Multiplication Tables]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>
Before tackling larger division problems, it's essential to know your [[importance_of_multiplication_tables_in_division | multiplication tables]] from 1x1 up to at least 10x10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Some people even learn up to 12x12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This foundational knowledge allows you to quickly solve [[basic_steps_in_long_division | basic division problems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Simple Division
> To divide 25 by 5, you think: "5 times what is 25?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Knowing your 5-multiplication tables, you'll know that 5 times 5 equals 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
>
> In this case, you write the 5 in the **ones place** above the 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
>
> Similarly, for 49 divided by 7, you recall that 7 times 7 equals 49 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
>
> For 54 divided by 9, you know that 9 times 6 equals 54 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

Not all division problems result in a clean whole number. For example, to divide 23 by 3:
1.  Look for the largest multiple of 3 that is less than or equal to 23 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
2.  The multiples of 3 are 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. There is no 23 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
3.  The largest multiple is 21, which is 3 times 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
4.  So, 3 goes into 23 seven times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
5.  Multiply 7 by 3 to get 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
6.  Subtract 21 from 23 (23 - 21 = 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This 2 is the [[handling_remainders_in_division_problems | remainder]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
7.  The answer is 7 with a [[handling_remainders_in_division_problems | remainder]] of 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

### Long Division and Place Value with Larger Numbers
When dividing into numbers larger than what you know from your basic [[importance_of_multiplication_tables_in_division | multiplication tables]], you use a systematic approach that relies heavily on place value.

#### Example: Dividing 344 by 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>
1.  **Divide the first digit:** Start by asking how many times 4 goes into 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Since 3 is smaller than 4, it goes in 0 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
2.  **Consider the first two digits:** Now, consider how many times 4 goes into 34 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
    *   Recall your 4-multiplication tables: 4 x 8 = 32 and 4 x 9 = 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
    *   Since 36 is greater than 34, 4 goes into 34 eight times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
    *   **Crucially, write the 8 in the tens place** above the 4 in 344 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This means you're really saying 4 goes into 340 eighty times (80 x 4 = 320) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
3.  **Multiply and Subtract:**
    *   Multiply the quotient digit (8) by the divisor (4): 8 x 4 = 32 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Write 32 below 34.
    *   Subtract 34 - 32 = 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. This 2 is effectively 20, as it's in the tens column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
4.  **Bring Down the Next Digit:** Bring down the next digit from the dividend (4) to form 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
5.  **Divide Again:** Now, determine how many times 4 goes into 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
    *   You know that 4 x 6 = 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
    *   Write the 6 in the ones place of the quotient, next to the 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
6.  **Multiply and Subtract Final Time:**
    *   Multiply 6 by 4: 6 x 4 = 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
    *   Subtract 24 - 24 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. The [[handling_remainders_in_division_problems | remainder]] is 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

Therefore, 344 divided by 4 is exactly 86 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Place Notation in Action
> When you place the first digit of the quotient (e.g., the '8' in 86) above the tens digit of the dividend (e.g., the '4' in 344), you are effectively indicating that the '8' represents 80. The subtraction of 32 from 34 then effectively becomes 320 from 340, with a remainder of 20, before the next digit is brought down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

#### Example: Dividing 91 by 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>
1.  **Divide 7 into 9:** 7 goes into 9 one time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
    *   Write the 1 in the tens place above the 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
    *   Multiply 1 x 7 = 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
    *   Subtract 9 - 7 = 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
2.  **Bring Down:** Bring down the 1 to make 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
3.  **Divide Again:** 7 goes into 21 three times (since 7 x 3 = 21) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
    *   Write the 3 in the ones place of the quotient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
    *   Multiply 3 x 7 = 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
    *   Subtract 21 - 21 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

So, 91 divided by 7 is 13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

#### Example: Dividing 608 by 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>
1.  **Divide 8 into 6:** 8 goes into 6 zero times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
2.  **Consider the first two digits:** 8 goes into 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
    *   8 x 7 = 56, and 8 x 8 = 64 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
    *   Since 64 is too large, 8 goes into 60 seven times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
    *   Write the 7 in the tens place, above the 0 in 608 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
    *   Multiply 7 x 8 = 56 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
    *   Subtract 60 - 56 = 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
3.  **Bring Down:** Bring down the 8 to make 48 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
4.  **Divide Again:** 8 goes into 48 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.
    *   8 x 6 = 48 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
    *   Write the 6 in the ones place of the quotient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.
    *   Multiply 6 x 8 = 48 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
    *   Subtract 48 - 48 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

Thus, 608 divided by 8 is 76 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

> [!SUMMARY] Key Takeaway
> The process of [[basic_steps_in_long_division | long division]] involves repeatedly dividing, multiplying, and subtracting at each place value. Correctly placing the quotient digits ensures that you are treating the numbers as their true values (e.g., hundreds, tens, ones) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Mastering this technique, built upon solid [[importance_of_multiplication_tables_in_division | multiplication tables]] knowledge, allows you to tackle complex division problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

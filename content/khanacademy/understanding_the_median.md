The [[Median | median]] is a statistical measure used to describe the [[Central tendency | central tendency]] of a dataset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. It represents the "middle number" in a set of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.

## Calculating the Median

To find the [[Median | median]] of a set of numbers, the first step is to order the numbers from least to greatest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.

### Example Calculation

Let's find the [[Median | median]] for the following set of numbers: 23, 29, 20, 32, 23, 21, 33, 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

1.  **Order the numbers**:
    First, arrange the numbers from least to greatest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>:
    20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>, 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>, 23 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>, 23 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>, 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>, 29 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>, 32 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>, 33 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.

2.  **Identify the middle number(s)**:
    In this dataset, there are 8 numbers in total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. When there's an even number of data points, there will be two "middle" numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.
    In this case, the two middle numbers are 23 and 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.
    *   23 cannot be the median by itself because there are three numbers less than it and four greater than it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.
    *   25 cannot be the median by itself because there are three numbers larger than it and four less than it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

3.  **Average the middle numbers**:
    To find the [[Median | median]] with an even number of data points, you average the two middle numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>, which is the [[mean_or_central_tendency_in_statistics | mean]] of those two values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.
    (23 + 25) / 2 = 48 / 2 = 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

Therefore, the [[Median | median]] of the dataset is 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. Even if 24 is not one of the original numbers in the set, it is still the [[Median | median]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.

The [[Median | median]] is another important way to represent the [[Central tendency | central tendency]] or "middle" of a dataset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>. Along with the [[mean_median_and_mode | mean]] and [[Finding the mode | mode]], it provides different perspectives on the data's distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

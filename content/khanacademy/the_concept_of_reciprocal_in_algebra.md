From: [[khanacademy]] <br/> 

Solving linear equations in algebra often involves isolating a variable, and a key method for doing this, particularly when dealing with fractions, is using the concept of a reciprocal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. This approach is introduced in [[introduction_to_algebra | Level one linear equations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Understanding the Basics: From Division to Reciprocal

Initially, solving simple equations like `5x = 20` can be done by dividing both sides of the equation by the number multiplying `x` (the coefficient) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. For `5x = 20`, dividing by `5` yields `x = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. This is implicitly asking "what number times 5 is equal to 20?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>, which can be seen as an [[visualizing_algebraic_operations | algebraic operation]] and an [[application_of_abstraction_in_algebra | application of abstraction]] where `x` replaces a question mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>.

An equivalent and often more versatile method for solving equations is to multiply both sides by the reciprocal of the coefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. Multiplying by a fraction's reciprocal is the same as dividing by the fraction itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. For example, instead of dividing `5x = 20` by `5`, one could multiply both sides by `1/5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. This still results in `x = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.

### Why Use Reciprocals?

The reciprocal method becomes particularly useful when the coefficient is a fraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.
The **coefficient** is the term for the number being multiplied by the variable `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.

## Solving Equations with Fractional Coefficients

Consider the equation `-3/4x = 10/13` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. This is more complex than simple whole numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. To solve it [[understanding_equality_in_algebra | algebraically]], one must multiply both sides by the reciprocal of `-3/4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.

The reciprocal of `-3/4` is `-4/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.
Multiplying both sides of the equation by `-4/3`:
`(-4/3) * (-3/4x) = (10/13) * (-4/3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>

On the left side, `(-4/3)` and `(-3/4)` cancel each other out, leaving `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.
On the right side, the multiplication proceeds:
`x = (10 * -4) / (13 * 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>
`x = -40/39` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>

The resulting fraction `-40/39` is often left as an improper fraction for ease of calculation, though it can also be written as a mixed number (`-1 and 1/39`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.

### Another Example

To solve `-5/6x = 7/8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>:
1.  Identify the reciprocal of the coefficient `-5/6`, which is `-6/5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>.
2.  Multiply both sides by `-6/5`:
    `(-6/5) * (-5/6x) = (7/8) * (-6/5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>
3.  The left side simplifies to `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>.
4.  Simplify the right side by dividing `6` and `8` by `2` to get `3` and `4` respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>:
    `x = (7 * -3) / (4 * 5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>
    `x = -21/20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>

## Checking Your Answer

A valuable aspect of algebra is the ability to verify the solution by substituting the calculated value of `x` back into the original equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.

For `x = -40/39` in `-3/4x = 10/13`:
`-3/4 * (-40/39)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>
This simplifies by canceling `4` and `40` (to `1` and `10`) and `3` and `39` (to `1` and `13`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.
`(-1/1) * (-10/13) = 10/13` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. Since `10/13` matches the right side of the original equation, the solution is correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>.

Similarly, for `x = -21/20` in `-5/6x = 7/8`:
`-5/6 * (-21/20)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>
This simplifies to `(1 * 7) / (2 * 4) = 7/8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>, confirming the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>.

## Algebraic Notation for Multiplication

In algebra, various conventions imply multiplication:
*   A number written directly next to a variable, e.g., `5x` means `5 * x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.
*   A dot between two numbers, e.g., `-4/3 * x` can be written as `-4/3 Â· x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.
*   Parentheses, e.g., `-3/4` next to `(-40/39)` also signifies multiplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.

These notations are used to avoid confusion with the variable `x` if a traditional multiplication sign (`x`) were used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.

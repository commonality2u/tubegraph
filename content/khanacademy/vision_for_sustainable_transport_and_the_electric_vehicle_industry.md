Elon Musk identified sustainable energy as one of the three areas that would most profoundly affect the future of humanity, alongside the internet and [[space_exploration_and_spacexs_mission | space exploration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. His initial academic focus, specifically in applied physics and material science at Stanford, was on advanced capacitors for electric cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. This early work aimed at developing capacitors with energy density exceeding batteries, offering high power density and extended cycle life for mobile energy storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

## Tesla's Mission and Impact

The primary goal of Tesla is to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>. This mission is driven by the belief that the current cost of gasoline does not properly account for the environmental effects of CO2 on oceans and the atmosphere, which prevents normal market forces from functioning correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>. Tesla aims to act as a catalyst, attempting to make the widespread adoption of sustainable transport happen perhaps 10 years sooner than it would naturally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:14">[00:31:14]</a>.

Tesla's approach includes:
*   **Producing Electric Cars** Tesla focuses exclusively on making electric vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>.
*   **Supplying Powertrains** Tesla also supplies powertrains to other car companies, such as Toyota and Mercedes, to further accelerate their production of electric vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a>.

Despite the [[challenges_in_car_production_at_tesla | inherent challenges in car production]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, Tesla has seen significant success, leading its segment in sales with vehicles like the Model S, outselling competitors such as the Mercedes S class, BMW 7 Series, and Lexus LS400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>.

## Future Vision for the Electric Vehicle Industry

Tesla's ultimate objective is not merely to become a major automotive brand or to compete with mainstream models like the Honda Civic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:49">[00:32:49]</a>. Instead, the goal is to continuously produce more electric cars and drive down their price point until the automotive industry is "very firmly electric" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>.

The "victory condition" for Tesla's mission is when approximately half of all new cars manufactured are electric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:23">[00:33:23]</a>. Elon Musk estimates this could happen in about 13 or 14 years from 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:54">[00:33:54]</a>. The pace of technology improvement in electric energy storage is advancing faster than many people realize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>. The adoption of new technologies typically follows an S-curve, where initial predictions are often conservative, followed by over-prediction at the midpoint, and finally, a longer-than-expected but still faster than initial adoption period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>.

## Hyperloop: A Future Transportation System

Musk also conceptualized the Hyperloop, a high-speed transportation system envisioned as a superior alternative to conventional rail. Inspired by the high cost and slow speeds of California's high-speed rail project, he sought an ideal transportation system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:08">[00:44:08]</a>.

An ideal transportation system would be:
*   Twice as fast as existing modes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:46">[00:44:46]</a>.
*   Half the cost per ticket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:49">[00:44:49]</a>.
*   Immune to weather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>.
*   Incapable of crashing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>.
*   Self-powering, possibly with solar panels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>.

Musk believes such a system, potentially involving evacuated tubes, could be practical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:25">[00:45:25]</a>. He plans to release more details about Hyperloop after Tesla's earnings call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:45">[00:45:45]</a>. The goal is to create technology so exciting that it becomes a tourist attraction, demonstrating a better future than the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>.

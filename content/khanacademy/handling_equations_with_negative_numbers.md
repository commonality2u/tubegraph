This article explains how to solve mathematical equations, particularly those involving [[adding_and_subtracting_negative_numbers | negative numbers]], by applying operations consistently to both sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. The goal is to isolate the variable, often `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

## Basic Principles of Solving Equations

When solving an equation, remember that both sides are equal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. To maintain this equality, any operation performed on one side of the equation must also be performed on the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

> [!tip] Maintaining Equality
> If you get rid of an object or apply an operation to one side, you must do the same to the other side for the equality to remain true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Example 1: `3x + 5 = 17`

Let's consider the equation:
> `3x + 5 = 17` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>

This equation differs from simpler ones because of the `+ 5` term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

### Step 1: Eliminate the Constant Term

To simplify the left-hand side to just `3x`, you need to eliminate the `+ 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   To do this, subtract 5 from the left side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   To maintain equality, subtract 5 from the right side as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

> `3x + 5 - 5 = 17 - 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>

On the left, `5 - 5` cancels out, leaving `3x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
On the right, `17 - 5` equals 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

The equation simplifies to:
> `3x = 12` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>

### Step 2: Isolate the Variable

Now, divide both sides of the equation by 3 to isolate `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

> `3x / 3 = 12 / 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>

On the left, `3x / 3` simplifies to `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
On the right, `12 / 3` equals 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

The solution is:
> `x = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>

## Example 2: `7x - 2 = -10` with Negative Numbers

This example introduces [[adding_and_subtracting_negative_numbers | negative numbers]] into the equation:
> `7x - 2 = -10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>

### Step 1: Eliminate the Constant Term

To get rid of the `- 2` on the left side, add 2 to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Remember to do the same to the right side to maintain equality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

> `7x - 2 + 2 = -10 + 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>

On the left, `- 2 + 2` cancels out, leaving `7x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
On the right, `negative 10 plus 2` results in negative 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

> When [[adding_negative_numbers | adding a positive number]] to a negative number, you move to the right on a [[visualizing_negative_numbers_on_a_number_line | number line]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. For instance, starting at -10 and adding 2 moves you to -8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

The equation simplifies to:
> `7x = -8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>

### Step 2: Isolate the Variable

To isolate `x`, divide both sides of the equation by 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

> `7x / 7 = -8 / 7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>

On the left, `7x / 7` simplifies to `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
On the right, `-8 / 7` can be left as a fraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

The solution is:
> `x = -8/7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>

This can also be expressed as a mixed number: `x = -1 and 1/7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

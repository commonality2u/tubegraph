[[Understanding ratios | Ratios]] are mathematical expressions used to [[comparing_quantities_using_ratios | compare quantities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. While simple ratios compare two items, more complex problems involve multiple quantities and a total sum, requiring specific strategies to determine individual amounts.

## Determining Quantities from Ratios and a Total

When given a ratio and the total number of items, you can use the ratio to figure out the exact quantity of each item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>. This process involves identifying "groups" or "units" within the total quantity.

### Steps to Solve

1.  **Understand the Ratio**: A ratio like 2:3 for boys to girls means for every 2 boys, there are 3 girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>.
2.  **Sum the Ratio Parts**: Add the numbers in the ratio to find the total number of "parts" or "units" in one complete group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>. For a 2:3 ratio, 2 + 3 = 5 parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>. This means for every 5 students, there are 2 boys and 3 girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>.
3.  **Calculate the Number of Groups**: Divide the total number of items by the sum of the ratio parts to determine how many such "groups" exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>.
4.  **Find Individual Quantities**: Multiply the number of groups by the specific ratio part for the item you want to find <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>.

### Example 1: Boys and Girls in a Classroom

**Problem**: The ratio of boys to girls in a classroom is 2:3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:12">[07:07:12]</a>. There are 40 students total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>. How many girls are there? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>

*   **Ratio**: Boys:Girls = 2:3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>
*   **Total Students**: 40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>

**Solution**:
1.  **Sum of ratio parts**: 2 (boys) + 3 (girls) = 5 students per "group" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>.
2.  **Number of groups**: 40 total students / 5 students per group = 8 groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>.
3.  **Number of girls**: Each group has 3 girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>. With 8 groups, there are 8 groups * 3 girls/group = 24 girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>.
    *   *To find boys*: 8 groups * 2 boys/group = 16 boys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>.
    *   *Verification*: 24 girls + 16 boys = 40 total students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>.

### Example 2: Animals on a Farm (Multiple Quantities)

The same method applies even when ratios involve more than two quantities.

**Problem**: The ratio of sheep to chickens to pigs on a farm is 2:5:10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>. There are 51 animals in total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:00]</a>. How many chickens are there? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>

*   **Ratio**: Sheep:Chickens:Pigs = 2:5:10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a> (This ratio is already in its [[reducing_ratios_to_simplest_form | simplest form]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>).
*   **Total Animals**: 51 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:00]</a>

**Solution**:
1.  **Sum of ratio parts**: 2 (sheep) + 5 (chickens) + 10 (pigs) = 17 animals per "group" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:00">[12:51:00]</a>.
2.  **Number of groups**: 51 total animals / 17 animals per group = 3 groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:16:00">[13:16:00]</a>.
3.  **Number of chickens**: Each group has 5 chickens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:00]</a>. With 3 groups, there are 3 groups * 5 chickens/group = 15 chickens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:43:00">[13:43:00]</a>.
    *   This same process can be used to find the number of sheep (3 groups * 2 sheep/group = 6 sheep) or pigs (3 groups * 10 pigs/group = 30 pigs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:07:00">[14:07:00]</a>.
    *   *Verification*: 6 sheep + 15 chickens + 30 pigs = 51 total animals.

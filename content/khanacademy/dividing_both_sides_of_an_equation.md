Dividing both sides of an equation is a fundamental [[operations_on_both_sides_of_an_equation | operation]] used to [[isolating_a_variable_in_an_equation | isolate a variable]] and [[solving_equations_with_variables | solve for its value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. This principle states that if an equation holds true, performing the same division operation on both the left and right sides will maintain the equality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

## How It Works

When an equation is in the form of a coefficient multiplied by a variable (e.g., `3x` or `7x`) equal to a constant, dividing by the coefficient allows the variable to be isolated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

*   **Cancellation**: When `3x` is divided by `3`, the `3`'s cancel out, leaving just `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This is because `3` times something divided by `3` is simply that something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Similarly, `7x` divided by `7` results in `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

### Example 1: Solving 3x = 12

Consider the equation `3x = 12` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
To [[isolating_a_variable_in_an_equation | isolate]] `x`, divide both sides of the equation by `3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>:

*   Divide the left-hand side by `3`: `3x / 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>
*   Divide the right-hand side by `3`: `12 / 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>

This results in:
`x = 12 / 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>
`x = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>

Visually, dividing `3x` into three groups means each group contains `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. If `12` is divided into three groups, each group contains `4`, thus `x` must be equal to `4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### Example 2: Solving 7x = -8

When working with negative numbers, the process remains the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Consider `7x = -8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
To [[isolating_a_variable_in_an_equation | isolate]] `x`, divide both sides by `7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>:

*   Divide the left-hand side by `7`: `7x / 7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>
*   Divide the right-hand side by `7`: `-8 / 7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>

This results in:
`x = -8 / 7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>
This can be left as a fraction or converted to a mixed number, `negative 1 and 1/7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

## Application in Solving Equations

Dividing both sides of an equation is often the final step in [[solving_equations_with_variables | solving linear equations]]. For equations like `3x + 5 = 17` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a> or `7x - 2 = -10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, other [[operations_on_both_sides_of_an_equation | operations]], such as addition or subtraction, are performed first to get the equation into the `ax = b` form before division is applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

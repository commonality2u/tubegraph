A radical is another term for the square root symbol (√) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Simplifying radicals involves expressing them in their simplest form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This process is an extension of exponent rules, specifically dealing with numbers raised to the 1/2 power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

## The Role of [[perfect_squares_in_algebra | Perfect Squares]] in Simplification

To simplify a radical, the goal is to find factors of the number under the radical sign that are [[perfect_squares_in_algebra | perfect squares]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. A [[perfect_squares_in_algebra | perfect square]] is an integer that is the square of another integer (e.g., 9 is a [[perfect_squares_in_algebra | perfect square]] because 3 * 3 = 9) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

The process involves:
1.  Factoring the number under the radical into two numbers, one of which is the largest possible [[perfect_squares_in_algebra | perfect square]] factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
2.  Separating the square root of the [[perfect_squares_in_algebra | perfect square]] from the square root of the remaining factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
3.  Taking the square root of the [[perfect_squares_in_algebra | perfect square]] to move it outside the radical sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

### Common [[perfect_squares_in_algebra | Perfect Squares]]
Familiarizing yourself with common [[perfect_squares_in_algebra | perfect squares]] will make radical simplification easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. These include:
*   1 (1 * 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>
*   4 (2 * 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>
*   9 (3 * 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>
*   16 (4 * 4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>
*   25 (5 * 5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>
*   36 (6 * 6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>
*   49 (7 * 7) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>
*   64 (8 * 8) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>

If any of these numbers are a factor of the number under the radical, they should be factored out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

### Example 6: Simplifying 3√29
To simplify 3 times the square root of 29 (3√29) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>:
1.  Identify factors of 29. 29 is a prime number, meaning its only factors are 1 and 29 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
2.  Neither 1 nor 29 are [[perfect_squares_in_algebra | perfect squares]] that would simplify the radical further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
3.  Therefore, this expression is already in its completely simplified form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

### Example 7: Simplifying 7√320 (Multi-Step Process)
To simplify 7 times the square root of 320 (7√320) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>:
1.  For larger numbers, factorization can be done in steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
2.  Identify an initial [[perfect_squares_in_algebra | perfect square]] factor. 16 goes into 320 (16 * 20 = 320) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
3.  Rewrite: 7√320 = 7√(16 * 20) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
4.  Separate and simplify: 7 * √16 * √20 = 7 * 4 * √20 = 28√20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
5.  Check if the remaining number under the radical (20) can be further simplified. 20 has a [[perfect_squares_in_algebra | perfect square]] factor of 4 (4 * 5 = 20) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
6.  Rewrite: 28√20 = 28√(4 * 5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
7.  Separate and simplify again: 28 * √4 * √5 = 28 * 2 * √5 = 56√5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
8.  The number under the radical (5) cannot be simplified further as it has no [[perfect_squares_in_algebra | perfect square]] factors other than 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
9.  Final simplified form: 56√5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

This iterative process ensures that the radical is simplified to its fullest extent, leaving a number under the radical that has no [[perfect_squares_in_algebra | perfect square]] factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

The [[the_nephron_structure | nephron]] is the smallest functional unit of the [[kidney_anatomy_and_function | kidney]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Its primary functions are waste excretion and maintaining proper water and salt levels in the blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. While the initial step involves [[filtration_in_the_kidney | filtration]] of blood, a crucial part of the nephron's role is the reabsorption of essential substances and water back into the bloodstream.

## Initial Filtration: The Bowman's Capsule

Blood enters the glomerulus, a network of capillaries within the Bowman's capsule, via the afferent arteriole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. The glomerulus is very porous and surrounded by podocyte cells that selectively filter the blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. About one-fifth of the fluid, along with dissolved substances, is squeezed out of the blood and into the Bowman's space, forming what is called filtrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

This filtrate contains small ions (like sodium), small molecules (like glucose), and amino acids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Larger molecules and cells, such as red blood cells and large proteins, are not filtered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. At this stage, the fluid is not yet urine, as it contains many valuable substances the body needs to retain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

## Reabsorption in the Proximal Tubule

The filtrate then moves from the Bowman's capsule into the proximal tubule, the first part of the nephron's convoluted tube structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. The main purpose of the proximal tubule is to begin reabsorbing substances that the body does not want to lose in the urine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

Key substances reabsorbed here include:
*   Glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>
*   Sodium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>
*   Amino acids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>
*   A portion of the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>

This reabsorption is an active process, meaning it requires energy in the form of ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. For example, ATP is used to pump out sodium, which then helps bring in other substances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. The reabsorbed substances, including some water, are transferred back into the nearby capillary system surrounding the tubule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

## Reabsorption in the Loop of Henle

The filtrate then enters the [[loop_of_henle_mechanisms | Loop of Henle]], which dips down into the renal medulla, a saltier region of the [[kidney_anatomy_and_function | kidney]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. This unique structure is crucial for efficient water reabsorption.

The [[loop_of_henle_mechanisms | Loop of Henle]] has two main parts:
1.  **Ascending Limb:** This part actively pumps out salts (sodium, potassium, chloride ions) into the surrounding renal medulla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. This process requires ATP and works against a [[role_of_concentration_gradients_in_diffusion_and_osmosis | concentration gradient]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. The ascending limb is not permeable to water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>. The active pumping of salts makes the renal medulla very salty, or hypertonic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.
2.  **Descending Limb:** In contrast, the descending limb is only permeable to water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. As the filtrate moves down this limb into the hypertonic medulla, water naturally flows out of the tubule and into the saltier interstitial fluid via [[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | osmosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. This is a major mechanism for reabsorbing a large amount of the filtered water without direct ATP expenditure on water itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

## Reabsorption in the Distal Tubule and Collecting Duct

After the [[loop_of_henle_mechanisms | Loop of Henle]], the filtrate enters the distal convoluted tubule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. Here, further reabsorption of substances like calcium and more sodium occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. A small amount of water is also reabsorbed in this segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>. This continues to concentrate the filtrate and reclaim vital components.

Finally, the processed filtrate, now much more concentrated, enters the collecting duct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. Multiple [[the_nephron_structure | nephrons]] empty into a single collecting duct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. The collecting duct also passes through the salty renal medulla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>. The permeability of the collecting duct to water is regulated by hormones, such as anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. If the collecting duct is made more porous by ADH, more water will leave the filtrate into the hypertonic medulla via [[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | osmosis]], leading to even more concentrated urine and less water loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.

Once the final reabsorption steps are complete, the fluid, now called urine, leaves the [[kidney_anatomy_and_function | kidney]] via the ureters and collects in the urinary bladder for excretion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>. This intricate reabsorption process ensures that the body maintains its crucial water balance and retains valuable nutrients while effectively excreting waste products.

Founded by [[inspiration_from_elon_musks_achievements | Elon Musk]], SpaceX was conceived out of a desire to see humanity become a multi-planet species and avoid eventual extinction on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. Musk identified space exploration as one of three areas that would most affect the future of humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

## Genesis of SpaceX

The initial idea for SpaceX stemmed from Musk's frustration in 2001 after discovering that NASA had no concrete plans to send people to Mars, or even return to the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. He initially considered a project called "Mars Oasis," which involved sending a small greenhouse to Mars with seeds to create the first life on the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. This project was envisioned to generate public excitement for space and potentially increase NASA's budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.

Musk was willing to commit half the money he earned from [[elon_musks_ventures_into_electric_vehicles_space_exploration_and_internet_companies | PayPal]] to this endeavor, with no expectation of financial return, believing it was a highly important goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.

## Initial Challenges and Skepticism

Many friends and colleagues tried to dissuade Musk from starting a rocket company, believing it was "crazy" and that he would lose his investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. Some even showed him videos of rockets exploding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>. However, Musk already expected to lose money, as his motivation was not financial return but rather to "spur on" humanity's expansion beyond Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.

He encountered significant cost barriers, as US rockets were prohibitively expensive, with a Boeing Delta II costing around $65 million per launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. This led him to explore buying ICBMs (Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles) from Russia, which he found would cost about $10 million each in 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. He even negotiated a price for two ICBMs, aiming for a dual mission for approximately $40 million total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>.

After three trips to Russia, Musk realized that the primary impediment to space exploration was not a "lack of will" among people, but rather a "lack of way" – the absence of an affordable method to reach space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. He then focused on determining "how hard is it really to make a rocket?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>. By breaking down the raw material cost of a rocket's components (aluminum, titanium, copper, carbon fiber), he found it was only about 2% of the total cost, indicating that the true expense lay in the arrangement of these atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>.

## Early Setbacks and Breakthroughs

The initial flights of SpaceX's first rocket, the Falcon 1, were not immediately successful, with the first three launches failing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. However, they progressively achieved more during each attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>.

Despite the failures, SpaceX achieved significant cost reductions:
*   **Falcon 1:** Cost around $6 million to build, compared to other rockets in its class that cost about $25 million – roughly a quarter of the price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>.
*   **Falcon 9:** Currently costs about $60 million, which is approximately a quarter of the price of comparable rockets from companies like Boeing or Lockheed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a>.

## Vision for Reusability and Future Impact

A key objective for SpaceX is to make rockets reusable, which Musk believes could make launches two orders of magnitude (100 times) cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>. While SpaceX has successfully recovered spacecraft from orbit, attempts to recover rocket stages have, as of the interview, resulted in them "always blown up essentially on reentry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>. Musk believes they have identified the reasons for these failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.

The challenge lies in optimizing rocket mass and engine efficiency to account for the strong gravitational pull of Earth and the weight subtracted by reusability components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:58">[00:26:58]</a>. The aim is to achieve a net payload to orbit of about 2% in a reusable configuration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>. He is hopeful that vertical landings and reusability can be achieved by the following year (2014) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>.

The propellant cost for a Falcon 9 rocket is only about $200,000, significantly less than its $60 million build cost, making reusability the logical next step for cost reduction, similar to refueling a 747 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:57">[00:27:57]</a>.

SpaceX's long-term impact on the space industry includes:
*   **Continued commercial satellite launches:** Providing services for broadcast communications, mapping, scientific missions, and GPS satellites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>.
*   **Servicing the International Space Station:** Transferring cargo and eventually people to and from the space station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>.
*   **Human mission to Mars:** Musk's best guess is that humanity will have someone on Mars in about 12 years (circa 2025), aiming for a round trip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a>.
*   **Catalytic effect:** By proving a more efficient and affordable "way" to space, SpaceX aims to reignite widespread enthusiasm and capability for space exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>.

The [[the_role_of_failure_in_learning | role of failure in learning]] was evident in SpaceX's early launches, where initial failures were followed by progressive improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>. This approach highlights the company's commitment to [[starting_from_zero_and_progressing | starting from zero and progressing]] despite daunting [[challenges_and_intricacies_of_car_manufacturing_and_supply_chain_management | challenges and intricacies of car manufacturing and supply chain management]].

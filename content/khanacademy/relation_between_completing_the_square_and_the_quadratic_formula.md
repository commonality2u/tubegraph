[[completing_the_square_as_a_technique_for_solving_quadratic_equations | Completing the square]] is a powerful algebraic technique used to solve [[solving_quadratic_equations_using_the_quadratic_formula | quadratic equations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Its significance extends beyond merely solving equations, as it forms the fundamental basis for the [[completing_the_square_and_derivation_of_the_quadratic_formula | derivation of the quadratic formula]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Completing the Square as the Basis for the Quadratic Formula

The technique of [[completing_the_square_as_a_technique_for_solving_quadratic_equations | completing the square]] is universally applicable to any [[solving_quadratic_equations_using_the_quadratic_formula | quadratic equation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This broad applicability is precisely why it serves as the foundation for the [[introduction_to_the_quadratic_formula | quadratic formula]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Unlike [[factoring_quadratic_expressions | factoring]], which may not always be straightforward or even possible for all [[solving_quadratic_equations_using_the_quadratic_formula | quadratic equations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>, [[completing_the_square_as_a_technique_for_solving_quadratic_equations | completing the square]] "will always work" regardless of the coefficients or complexity of the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

The [[completing_the_square_and_derivation_of_the_quadratic_formula | quadratic formula]] itself is derived by applying the steps of [[completing_the_square_as_a_technique_for_solving_quadratic_equations | completing the square]] to the general form of a [[solving_quadratic_equations_using_the_quadratic_formula | quadratic equation]] (axÂ² + bx + c = 0) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. While the [[completing_the_square_and_derivation_of_the_quadratic_formula | proof of the quadratic formula]] using this method is detailed in a separate discussion, understanding [[completing_the_square_as_a_technique_for_solving_quadratic_equations | completing the square]] is crucial to grasp the rationale behind the formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

By transforming a [[solving_quadratic_equations_using_the_quadratic_formula | quadratic equation]] into a [[converting_a_quadratic_equation_into_a_perfect_square | perfect square]] trinomial on one side, it becomes possible to isolate the variable and solve for its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This systematic approach, central to [[completing_the_square_as_a_technique_for_solving_quadratic_equations | completing the square]], leads directly to the robust and universally applicable [[introduction_to_the_quadratic_formula | quadratic formula]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.

[[Solving algebraic equations | Solving algebraic equations]] often involves performing operations on both sides of an equation to isolate the variable. This method builds on simpler [[solving_equations_with_variables_on_both_sides | equation-solving techniques]] by incorporating additional steps to simplify the equation before isolating the variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Core Principle: Maintaining Equality

The fundamental rule when [[performing_legitimate_algebraic_operations | performing legitimate algebraic operations]] to solve equations is that any operation performed on one side of the equation must also be performed on the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This ensures that the equality of the equation remains true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Examples of Balancing Different Types of Equations

### Example 1: 3x + 5 = 17

Consider the equation 3x + 5 = 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This is more complicated than equations seen previously due to the addition of a constant (+5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. If it were just 3x = 17, one would simply divide both sides by 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

To understand the equation intuitively, 3x can be thought of as "x plus x plus x" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The equation states that "three x's plus five objects" equals "seventeen objects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

The [[steps_to_balance_a_chemical_equation | steps to balance this equation]] are:

1.  **Eliminate the constant term**: To get 3x alone on the left side, subtract 5 from both sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
    *   (3x + 5) - 5 = 17 - 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>
    *   On the left, +5 and -5 cancel out, leaving 3x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
    *   On the right, 17 - 5 equals 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
    *   The equation simplifies to 3x = 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

2.  **Isolate the variable**: Divide both sides of the equation by 3 to find the value of x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
    *   3x / 3 = 12 / 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>
    *   On the left, the 3's cancel, leaving x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
    *   On the right, 12 divided by 3 equals 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
    *   Therefore, x = 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

### Example 2: 7x - 2 = -10

Consider the equation 7x - 2 = -10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. This example introduces negative numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

The [[steps_to_balance_a_chemical_equation | steps to balance this equation]] are:

1.  **Eliminate the constant term**: To get 7x alone on the left side, add 2 to both sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
    *   (7x - 2) + 2 = -10 + 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>
    *   On the left, -2 and +2 cancel out, leaving 7x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
    *   On the right, -10 + 2 equals -8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. When adding a positive number to a negative number, one moves to the right on a number line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
    *   The equation simplifies to 7x = -8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

2.  **Isolate the variable**: Divide both sides of the equation by 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
    *   7x / 7 = -8 / 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>
    *   On the left, the 7's cancel, leaving x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
    *   On the right, -8 divided by 7 can be left as a fraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
    *   Therefore, x = -8/7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>, or as a mixed number, x = -1 and 1/7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

By consistently applying operations to both sides of the equation, even complex algebraic problems can be systematically simplified to find the value of the unknown variable.

This article explores the process of simplifying [[mathematical_expressions | expressions]] by applying concepts such as the [[addition_and_multiplication_relationship | distributive property]] and combining like terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Simplifying Expressions with the Distributive Property

To simplify an [[mathematical_expressions | expression]] like `2(3x + 5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, one can interpret it as two instances of `(3x + 5)` being added together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>:
`(3x + 5) + (3x + 5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>

This sum contains two "3x" terms and two "5" terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This can be rewritten as `2(3x) + 2(5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This method demonstrates the [[addition_and_multiplication_relationship | distributive property]], a concept familiar from [[arithmetic_mean | arithmetic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

Applying the multiplication:
*   `2 * 3x` equals `6x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>
*   `2 * 5` equals `10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>

Thus, `2(3x + 5)` simplifies to `6x + 10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## More Complex Simplification

Consider a more involved [[mathematical_expressions | expression]] such as `7(3y - 5) - 2(10 + 4y)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### Distributing the First Term

First, distribute the `7` to the terms inside the first parenthesis `(3y - 5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>:
*   `7 * 3y` results in `21y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>
*   `7 * -5` (being careful with the sign) results in `-35` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>

So, `7(3y - 5)` simplifies to `21y - 35` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### Distributing the Second Term (with a Negative Sign)

Next, simplify the second part of the [[mathematical_expressions | expression]], `-2(10 + 4y)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. It's important to distribute the entire `-2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>:
*   `-2 * 10` results in `-20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>
*   `-2 * 4y` results in `-8y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>

So, `-2(10 + 4y)` simplifies to `-20 - 8y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### Combining Like Terms

Now, combine the simplified parts: `21y - 35 - 20 - 8y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
Identify terms that are "alike" (i.e., those containing `y` and constant terms):
*   Combine `21y` and `-8y`:
    *   `21y - 8y` equals `13y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>
*   Combine `-35` and `-20`:
    *   `-35 - 20` equals `-55` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>

Thus, the entire [[mathematical_expressions | expression]] `7(3y - 5) - 2(10 + 4y)` simplifies to `13y - 55` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

> [!INFO] Summary
> Simplifying [[mathematical_expressions | expressions]] often involves two main steps:
> 1.  Applying the [[addition_and_multiplication_relationship | distributive property]] to remove parentheses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
> 2.  Combining "like" terms (e.g., terms with the same variable and exponent, or constants) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
> Remember to be careful with negative signs when distributing, treating a subtraction as distributing a negative number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

The Krebs cycle, also known as the citric acid cycle, is a central part of [[cellular_respiration_process | cellular respiration]] that takes place within the mitochondrial matrix of eukaryotic cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. This entire cycle is facilitated by enzymes, which are proteins that bring together reactants in the correct orientation to enable chemical reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>.

## Preparatory Stage: Pyruvate Oxidation

Before entering the Krebs cycle, pyruvate molecules undergo [[role_of_pyruvate_oxidation_in_preparing_for_the_krebs_cycle | pyruvate oxidation]], a preparatory step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>. This process converts the 3-carbon pyruvate into a 2-carbon compound called acetyl-CoA by cleaving off one carbon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. The cleaved carbon leaves the system as carbon dioxide (CO2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>. Additionally, this stage reduces NAD+ to NADH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

Since [[steps_and_reactions_in_glycolysis | glycolysis]] produces two pyruvate molecules from a single glucose molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>, the pyruvate oxidation step occurs twice for every glucose molecule, yielding two NADHs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>.

## The Krebs Cycle Steps

The formal Krebs cycle begins with the 2-carbon acetyl-CoA merging with a 4-carbon molecule called oxaloacetic acid to form citrate (or citric acid), which is a 6-carbon molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>. This reaction, like all subsequent steps in the cycle, is catalyzed by [[enzymes_involved_in_glycolysis | enzymes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.

Citric acid then undergoes a series of oxidation steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>. During these steps:
*   Carbons are cleaved off the molecule, forming CO2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>.
*   NAD+ is reduced to NADH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>.
*   FAD is reduced to FADH2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>.
*   ADP is converted to ATP (sometimes via GTP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:49:00">[16:49:00]</a>.

At the end of the cycle, oxaloacetic acid is regenerated, allowing the cycle to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>.

## Outputs of the Krebs Cycle (per glucose molecule)

For every molecule of glucose, the Krebs cycle turns twice (once for each acetyl-CoA derived from pyruvate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a>. The total outputs from the Krebs cycle (excluding pyruvate oxidation) are:
*   **6 NADH** (3 per turn x 2 turns) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>
*   **2 ATP** (1 per turn x 2 turns) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:19:00">[11:19:00]</a>
*   **2 FADH2** (1 per turn x 2 turns) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:00">[11:29:00]</a>
*   **4 CO2** (2 carbons cleaved off per turn x 2 turns) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>. Combined with the 2 CO2 from pyruvate oxidation, all six carbons from the original glucose molecule are released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>.

While some [[cellular_respiration_process | cellular respiration]] textbooks may combine the NADH produced during pyruvate oxidation with the Krebs cycle, the reality is that 2 NADHs are from the preparatory stage and 6 NADHs are from the formal Krebs cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:00">[11:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a>.

The NADH and FADH2 molecules generated during the Krebs cycle are crucial as they are the primary inputs for the electron transport chain, where the bulk of [[atp_production_in_glycolysis | ATP production]] occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>. Each NADH can produce approximately 3 ATPs, and each FADH2 can produce approximately 2 ATPs in the electron transport chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>.

## Role in General Catabolism

The Krebs cycle is not exclusive to carbohydrate metabolism. Acetyl-CoA acts as a general catabolic intermediary, meaning that fats and proteins can also be broken down into acetyl-CoA and enter the Krebs cycle to generate ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:44:00">[14:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:00">[15:01:00]</a>. For example, proteins can be broken into amino acids, which can then be converted into acetyl-CoA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:51:00">[14:51:00]</a>. Fats can also be converted to glucose in the liver, which can then go through the entire [[cellular_respiration_process | cellular respiration]] pathway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:39:00">[14:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>.

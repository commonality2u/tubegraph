A **rational number** is defined as any number that can be represented as the ratio of two integers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This means it can be written as a fraction `a/b`, where `a` and `b` are integers, and `b` is not zero.

## Examples of Rational Numbers

### Integers
Any integer is considered a rational number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This is because any integer can be expressed as a ratio of itself and 1.
*   For example, the number 1 can be represented as 1/1, -2/-2, or 10,000/10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   Similarly, the [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | number -7]] can be represented as -7/1, 7/-1, or -14/2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
There are an infinite number of ways to represent a given integer as a ratio of two integers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

### Decimals
Numbers that are not integers can also be rational if they can be expressed as a ratio of two integers.
*   For instance, 3.75 can be rewritten as 375/100, which is the same as 750/200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. It can also be expressed as a mixed number, 3 and 3/4, which converts to the improper fraction 15/4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Multiplying both the numerator and denominator by a negative number, such as -2, also produces an equivalent ratio like -30/-8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. All these forms demonstrate that 3.75 is a rational number.

### [[repeating_decimals_as_rational_numbers | Repeating Decimals]]
[[repeating_decimals_as_rational_numbers | Repeating decimals]] are also rational numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   The most well-known example is 0.333... (often denoted as 0.3 repeating), which is equal to 1/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   Another example is 0.6 repeating, which is 2/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
Any [[repeating_decimals_as_rational_numbers | repeating decimal]], even if it has a long sequence of repeating digits, can always be represented as the ratio of two integers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

## Contrast with [[introduction_to_irrational_numbers | Irrational Numbers]]
Numbers that cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers are called [[introduction_to_irrational_numbers | irrational numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. These numbers never terminate and never repeat in their decimal representation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. [[famous_irrational_numbers_and_their_properties | Famous examples of irrational numbers]] include Pi (π), Euler's number (e), the square root of 2, and Phi (Φ), the golden ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

While [[famous_irrational_numbers_and_their_properties | irrational numbers]] might seem exotic, they are not uncommon; there is always at least one [[introduction_to_irrational_numbers | irrational number]] between any two rational numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. The sum of an [[introduction_to_irrational_numbers | irrational number]] and a rational number is always irrational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>, as is the product of an [[introduction_to_irrational_numbers | irrational number]] and a rational number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

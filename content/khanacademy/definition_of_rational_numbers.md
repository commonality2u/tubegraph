A rational number is defined as any number that can be represented as the ratio of two integers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Examples of Rational Numbers

### Integers
Any integer is a rational number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   **1**: Can be represented as 1/1, -2/-2, or 10,000/10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. These are all different [[representations_of_rational_numbers | representations]] of the number 1 as a ratio of two integers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. There are infinitely many such [[representations_of_rational_numbers | representations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   **-7**: Can be represented as -7/1, 7/-1, or -14/2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Therefore, -7 is a rational number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Non-Integer Decimals
Numbers that are not integers can also be rational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **3.75**: This can be rewritten as 375/100, which is the same as 750/200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. It can also be expressed as 3 and 3/4, which simplifies to 15/4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Another [[representations_of_rational_numbers | representation]] is -30/-8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Since it can be represented as a ratio of two integers, 3.75 is clearly rational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

### [[repeating_decimals_as_rational_numbers | Repeating Decimals]]
[[repeating_decimals_as_rational_numbers | Repeating decimals]] are also rational numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **0.333... (0.3 repeating)**: This is 1/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **0.666... (0.6 repeating)**: This is 2/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   Any [[repeating_decimals_as_rational_numbers | repeating decimal]], even if it has a million digits repeating, can always be represented as the ratio of two integers as long as the pattern repeats itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

In summary, rational numbers include all integers, all finite non-repeating decimals, and all [[repeating_decimals_as_rational_numbers | repeating decimals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

## Contrast with Irrational Numbers
Numbers that cannot be represented as the ratio of two integers are called [[examples_and_definition_of_irrational_numbers | irrational numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. These are often famous mathematical constants like Pi ($\pi$), *e*, the square root of 2, and Phi ($\phi$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. [[examples_and_definition_of_irrational_numbers | Irrational numbers]] never terminate and never repeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. Despite seeming exotic, [[characteristics_and_abundance_of_irrational_numbers | irrational numbers]] are not uncommon; there is always at least one [[examples_and_definition_of_irrational_numbers | irrational number]] between any two rational numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

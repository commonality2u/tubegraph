[[simplifying_expressions | Simplifying expressions]] involves applying known algebraic properties to rewrite an expression in a more concise or manageable form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This process often combines the distributive property with the grouping of "like terms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

## The Distributive Property

The distributive property allows a term outside parentheses to be multiplied by each term inside the parentheses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

### Example 1: Simplifying `2(3x + 5)`

To simplify `2(3x + 5)`, we can interpret it as literally two instances of `(3x + 5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, which can be written as `(3x + 5) + (3x + 5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

By grouping the terms, we get:
*   Two `3x` terms: `2(3x)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>
*   Two `5` terms: `2(5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>

Applying the distributive property:
`2(3x + 5) = 2(3x) + 2(5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>

Then, perform the multiplications:
*   `2 * 3x = 6x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>
*   `2 * 5 = 10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>

Therefore, `2(3x + 5)` simplifies to `6x + 10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Combining Like Terms

After applying the distributive property, the next step in [[simplifying_expressions | simplifying expressions]] is often to combine "like terms." Like terms are terms that have the same variables raised to the same power. For example, `21y` and `-8y` are like terms because they both involve the variable `y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### Example 2: Simplifying `7(3y - 5) - 2(10 + 4y)`

1.  **Distribute the `7` on the left side:**
    *   `7 * 3y = 21y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>
    *   `7 * -5 = -35` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>
    *   The left side becomes `21y - 35` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

2.  **Distribute the `-2` on the right side:**
    When a subtraction sign precedes a parenthetical expression, it's often helpful to think of distributing a negative number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
    *   `-2 * 10 = -20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>
    *   `-2 * 4y = -8y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>
    *   The right side becomes `-20 - 8y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

3.  **Combine the simplified parts:**
    The expression is now `21y - 35 - 20 - 8y`.

4.  **Identify and combine like terms:**
    *   **Terms with `y` (variables):** We have `21y` and `-8y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
        *   `21y - 8y = 13y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>
        *   (This demonstrates the [[role_of_variables_in_expressions | role of variables in expressions]], where 'y' represents an unknown quantity, and we combine the coefficients of that quantity).
    *   **Constant terms:** We have `-35` and `-20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
        *   `-35 - 20 = -55` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>

5.  **Final simplified expression:**
    Combining these, the expression simplifies to `13y - 55` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

**Summary of Steps:**
1.  Apply the distributive property to remove parentheses.
2.  Identify "like terms" (terms with the same variable raised to the same power, or constant terms).
3.  Combine like terms by adding or subtracting their coefficients.

The cellular membrane serves as the boundary that separates the cell from its external environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. It is a fundamental component of all cells and is crucial in defining the cell as a distinct, small compartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Definition and Function
Every cell possesses a cellular membrane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Its primary role is to enclose the cell's internal contents, maintaining a controlled internal environment distinct from the outside world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The term "cell" itself originates from the concept of this small compartment defined by the membrane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The cellular membrane is composed of two layers, known as a bilipid layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.

## Interaction with Proteins and Vesicles
The cellular membrane plays a key role in the trafficking of proteins. Proteins destined for the cell's membrane or for secretion outside the cell are processed through the [[function_of_endoplasmic_reticulum_and_Golgi_apparatus | endoplasmic reticulum]] and [[function_of_endoplasmic_reticulum_and_Golgi_apparatus | Golgi bodies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. These proteins are then encapsulated within small, membrane-bound sacs called vesicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.

Vesicles allow proteins to travel safely within the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. When a vesicle, containing a protein, approaches the cellular membrane, its own mini-membrane can merge with the cell's outer membrane because they are made of the same material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. This merging process facilitates the protein's exit from the cell or its embedding within the outer cellular membrane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.

### Cell Wall
In non-animal cells, such as plant cells, a cell wall provides additional strength and rigidity to the cellular membrane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>. While not entirely rigid, it acts like a balloon, offering structural support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. For instance, wood derives its significant rigidity from having double cell walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>. In plants, the cell wall is primarily composed of cellulose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>.

From: [[khanacademy]] <br/> 

For thousands of years, humans have observed that different substances in the environment possess distinct properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. These properties can include how a substance reflects light, its color, or its state (liquid, gas, or solid) at a given temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Furthermore, it has been noted how these substances react with each other under specific conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

Examples of such substances include:
*   Carbon (in its graphite form) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>
*   Lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>
*   Gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>
*   Various types of air particles like carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>

Substances can also change their state; for instance, gold or lead can become liquid if the temperature is raised high enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>, and carbon can turn into a gaseous state through burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Elements and Atoms

A fundamental question arises: if a substance like carbon is continuously broken down into smaller and smaller pieces, is there a smallest unit that still retains the properties of that substance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>? The answer is yes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

These pure substances, characterized by specific properties at certain temperatures and distinct reactions, are known as [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | elements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Carbon, lead, and gold are all [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | elements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Historically, water was considered an [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | element]], but it is now understood to be composed of more basic [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | elements]] like oxygen and hydrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. All known [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | elements]] are systematically listed in the Periodic Table of Elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

The most basic unit of any [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | element]] is the [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | atom]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. If you were to continuously break down a substance like carbon, you would eventually reach a carbon [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | atom]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. This [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | atom]] cannot be further broken down while still retaining the properties of carbon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | Atoms]] are incredibly small; for example, approximately one million carbon [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | atoms]] could be strung across the width of an average human hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

## Atomic Structure: The [[basic_building_blocks_of_matter | Basic Building Blocks of Matter]]

[[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | Atoms]] themselves are not indivisible; they are composed of even more fundamental particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. The arrangement and number of these fundamental particles define the properties of the [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | element]], or can even change the [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | element]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. These fundamental particles are:

### Protons
*   **Definition of an Element**: The number of protons in the nucleus of an [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | atom]] is what defines the [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | element]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Atomic Number**: This number is known as the atomic number, which is listed at the top for each [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | element]] in the periodic table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   **Specificity**: For example, hydrogen always has one proton, helium has two, and carbon always has six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. If the number of protons changes, the [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | element]] changes (e.g., carbon with seven protons becomes nitrogen) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Charge**: Protons carry a positive charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

### Neutrons
*   **Location**: Neutrons are found in the nucleus along with protons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **Variability**: The number of neutrons in an [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | atom]] of a given [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | element]] can vary without changing the [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | element]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. For instance, Carbon-12 has six protons and six neutrons, while Carbon-14 still has six protons but eight neutrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.
*   **Charge**: Neutrons are neutral, meaning they have no charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

### Electrons
*   **Location**: [[electrons_and_chemical_reactions | Electrons]] are typically depicted as moving or "buzzing" around the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   **Charge**: [[electrons_and_chemical_reactions | Electrons]] carry a negative charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
*   **Attraction**: Due to their opposite charges, [[electrons_and_chemical_reactions | electrons]] are attracted to the positively charged protons in the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
*   **Chemical Reactions**: The number and configuration of [[electrons_and_chemical_reactions | electrons]] determine how an [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | atom]] will react with other [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | atoms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.
*   **Ions**: An [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | atom]] is considered "neutral" if it has an equal number of protons and [[electrons_and_chemical_reactions | electrons]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. If an [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | atom]] gains or loses [[electrons_and_chemical_reactions | electrons]], it will acquire a net positive or negative charge, becoming an ion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

[[Balancing chemical equations | Balancing chemical equations]] can often confuse people, but it can be approached methodically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. When understood as an art, it becomes less challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Introduction to Chemical Equations

A chemical equation describes a reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. For example, an atom of aluminum reacting with a dioxygen molecule (O₂) forms aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

```
Al + O₂ → Al₂O₃
```

In this reaction:
*   [[understanding_reactants_and_products_in_chemical_reactions | Reactants]]: Aluminum (Al) and Dioxygen (O₂) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>
*   [[understanding_reactants_and_products_in_chemical_reactions | Product]]: Aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>

## The Need for [[balancing_chemical_equations | Balancing Chemical Equations]]

The purpose of [[balancing_chemical_equations | balancing]] is to ensure the same number of each atom is present on both sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Atoms cannot simply appear or disappear out of thin air during a reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, which aligns with the law of conservation of mass.

### Identifying Imbalances in an Example

Consider the unbalanced equation: `Al + O₂ → Al₂O₃`

*   **Aluminum (Al):**
    *   Left side: 1 atom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>
    *   Right side: 2 atoms (in Al₂O₃) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>
*   **Oxygen (O):**
    *   Left side: 2 atoms (in O₂) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>
    *   Right side: 3 atoms (in Al₂O₃) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>

This equation is currently unbalanced for both elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## The Process of [[balancing_chemical_equations | Balancing Chemical Equations]]

[[Steps to balance chemical equations | Balancing]] involves adjusting coefficients in front of molecules to equalize the number of atoms on both sides.

### Initial Adjustments

1.  **Balance Aluminum first:**
    Since there are 2 aluminum atoms on the right (in Al₂O₃) and only 1 on the left, add a coefficient of `2` in front of the aluminum on the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
    ```
    2Al + O₂ → Al₂O₃
    ```
    Now, aluminum is balanced (2 on each side) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. However, oxygen remains unbalanced (2 on the left, 3 on the right) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

### Dealing with Fractional Coefficients

To balance oxygen (2 on left, 3 on right), one might consider multiplying O₂ by `1.5` (2 * 1.5 = 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
```
2Al + 1.5O₂ → Al₂O₃
```
While this balances the atoms, the convention in chemistry is to avoid fractional molecules like "1.5 molecules" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. We want whole number coefficients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### Achieving Whole Number Coefficients

To eliminate the decimal, multiply all coefficients in the equation by a common number, similar to algebraic equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. In this case, multiplying by `2` will turn `1.5` into `3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

Original (with implicit 1s): `2Al + 1.5O₂ → 1Al₂O₃`

Multiply all coefficients by 2:
*   `2 * 2Al` = `4Al` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>
*   `2 * 1.5O₂` = `3O₂` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>
*   `2 * 1Al₂O₃` = `2Al₂O₃` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>

The balanced equation becomes:
```
4Al + 3O₂ → 2Al₂O₃
```

## Verification

After applying coefficients, verify the number of atoms for each element on both sides:

*   **Aluminum (Al):**
    *   Left side: 4 atoms (from `4Al`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>
    *   Right side: 4 atoms (from `2Al₂O₃`, where 2 * 2 = 4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>
*   **Oxygen (O):**
    *   Left side: 6 atoms (from `3O₂`, where 3 * 2 = 6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>
    *   Right side: 6 atoms (from `2Al₂O₃`, where 2 * 3 = 6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>

Both aluminum and oxygen are now balanced, confirming the equation is correctly balanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

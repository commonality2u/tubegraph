Distance and displacement are fundamental concepts in physics used to describe the movement of an object. The key [[difference_between_vectors_and_scalars | difference between them]] lies in whether they are [[difference_between_vectors_and_scalars | vector or scalar quantities]]. While they might sound complex, they are quite simple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Vectors and Scalars

Before defining distance and displacement, it's important to understand [[difference_between_vectors_and_scalars | vectors and scalars]]:
*   A **[[difference_between_vectors_and_scalars | vector]]** is a quantity that possesses both a magnitude (size) and a direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   A **[[difference_between_vectors_and_scalars | scalar]]** is a quantity that only has a magnitude (size) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Distance

**Distance** is a [[difference_between_vectors_and_scalars | scalar quantity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. It refers to the total ground covered by an object, without regard to its direction of movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. When someone states a distance, they are only providing the magnitude of the movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

### Example: Distance
Imagine a brick on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. If this brick is picked up and moved 5 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, and that's all the information given, then the measurement of 5 meters is a scalar quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This represents the **distance** the brick traveled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Without a specified direction, one wouldn't know if it moved to the right, left, up, down, or any other direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

## Displacement

**Displacement** is a [[difference_between_vectors_and_scalars | vector quantity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. It describes the overall change in an object's position, from its starting point to its ending point, including both the magnitude and the direction of that change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### Example: Displacement
Using the same brick example, if the brick is moved 5 meters **to the right** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, this statement includes both the magnitude (5 meters) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a> and the direction (to the right) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. This combined information describes the **displacement** of the brick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

## Key Distinction

*   **Distance** quantifies *how far* something has traveled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. It is the [[difference_between_vectors_and_scalars | scalar]] version of position change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **Displacement** quantifies *how far and in what direction* something has changed its position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. It is the [[difference_between_vectors_and_scalars | vector]] version of position change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

### Relation to Speed and Velocity
The concepts of distance and displacement directly relate to [[speed_vs_velocity | speed and velocity]]:
*   **[[speed_vs_velocity | Speed]]** is a [[difference_between_vectors_and_scalars | scalar quantity]] derived from distance over time, indicating only how fast something is going <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   **[[speed_vs_velocity | Velocity]]** is a [[difference_between_vectors_and_scalars | vector quantity]] derived from displacement over time, indicating both how fast something is going and in what direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

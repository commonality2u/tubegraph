Cellular respiration is the process by which cells break down glucose and other molecules to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary energy currency of the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This complex process involves multiple stages, beginning in the cytoplasm and largely continuing within the [[photosynthesis_and_respiration_organelles_like_mitochondria_and_chloroplasts | mitochondria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Glycolysis

The first stage of cellular respiration is [[glycolysis_process | glycolysis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.
*   **Process**: A 6-carbon glucose molecule is split in half, producing two 3-carbon pyruvic acid (or pyruvate) molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This process literally "lyses" the glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Location**: Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Oxygen Requirement**: It does not require oxygen and can happen in its presence or [[role_of_oxygen_in_cellular_respiration | absence of oxygen]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Net Products**: For every glucose molecule, glycolysis yields a net payoff of two [[atp_production_and_consumption_in_glycolysis | ATPs]] (four generated, two consumed) and two NADH molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Mitochondria: The Power Centers

The [[photosynthesis_and_respiration_organelles_like_mitochondria_and_chloroplasts | mitochondria]] are often referred to as the "power centers of the cell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. They possess two membranes: an outer membrane and a convoluted inner membrane called cristae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. These membranes divide the mitochondria into two compartments:
*   **Outer Compartment**: The space between the outer and inner membranes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
*   **Matrix**: The inner compartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
The subsequent stages of cellular respiration take place within these mitochondrial compartments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## Pyruvate Oxidation (Preparatory Step)

Before entering the [[cellular_respiration_phases | Krebs cycle]], pyruvate undergoes a preparatory step known as pyruvate oxidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Process**: One carbon atom is cleaved off each 3-carbon pyruvate molecule, forming a 2-carbon compound called acetyl-CoA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. The cleaved carbon atom is released as carbon dioxide (CO2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   **Products**: This process also reduces NAD+ to NADH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Since two pyruvate molecules are produced per glucose, this step occurs twice, yielding two NADH molecules and two CO2 molecules per glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

## The Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle)

The [[cellular_respiration_phases | Krebs cycle]], also known as the citric acid cycle, is a central part of energy production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Location**: It takes place in the mitochondrial matrix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   **Process**:
    1.  Acetyl-CoA (2-carbon) merges with oxaloacetic acid (a 4-carbon molecule) to form citrate (citric acid), a 6-carbon molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
    2.  Citrate is then oxidized over a series of steps, where two carbons are cleaved off and released as CO2, regenerating oxaloacetic acid to continue the cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
    3.  All reactions in the Krebs cycle are catalyzed by enzymes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **Products (per turn/per pyruvate)**: Each turn of the [[cellular_respiration_phases | Krebs cycle]] produces:
    *   3 NADH molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>
    *   1 [[atp_production_and_consumption_in_glycolysis | ATP]] (or GTP that is later converted to ATP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>
    *   1 FADH2 molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>
Since two acetyl-CoA molecules enter the cycle per glucose molecule, these products are doubled: 6 NADH, 2 [[atp_production_and_consumption_in_glycolysis | ATPs]], and 2 FADH2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

## Total Energy Yield from a Glucose Molecule

Combining the outputs from glycolysis, pyruvate oxidation, and the Krebs cycle for one molecule of glucose:

| Stage                 | Direct ATP | NADH | FADH2 |
| :-------------------- | :--------- | :--- | :---- |
| [[glycolysis_process | Glycolysis]]            | 2          | 2    | 0     |
| Pyruvate Oxidation    | 0          | 2    | 0     |
| [[cellular_respiration_phases | Krebs Cycle]]         | 2          | 6    | 2     |
| **Subtotal**          | **4**      | **10** | **2**   |
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>

### Role of NADH and FADH2 in ATP Production

While only four [[atp_production_and_consumption_in_glycolysis | ATPs]] are directly produced in these stages, the NADH and FADH2 molecules are crucial for generating the bulk of ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. These molecules act as electron carriers and are the inputs for the [[electron_transport_chain_and_atp_production | electron transport chain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

In the [[electron_transport_chain_and_atp_production | electron transport chain]]:
*   Each NADH molecule produces approximately three [[atp_production_and_consumption_in_glycolysis | ATPs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>, contributing to 30 [[atp_production_and_consumption_in_glycolysis | ATPs]] from 10 NADH molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
*   Each FADH2 molecule produces approximately two [[atp_production_and_consumption_in_glycolysis | ATPs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>, contributing to four [[atp_production_and_consumption_in_glycolysis | ATPs]] from two FADH2 molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

Therefore, the theoretical maximum yield of ATP from one glucose molecule through cellular respiration is 38 [[atp_production_and_consumption_in_glycolysis | ATPs]] (4 direct + 30 from NADH + 4 from FADH2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. While this represents the theoretical maximum in a highly efficient cell, actual yields may vary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

## Metabolism of Other Fuels

While glucose (carbohydrate metabolism) is the primary example, animals can also catabolize (break down) other macromolecules for energy, such as proteins and fats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.
*   Proteins can be broken down into amino acids, which can then be converted into acetyl-CoA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.
*   Fats can be turned into glucose, which can then enter [[introduction_to_cellular_respiration | cellular respiration]] through [[glycolysis_process | glycolysis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.
Acetyl-CoA serves as a general catabolic intermediary, allowing these different fuel sources to enter the [[cellular_respiration_phases | Krebs cycle]] and generate [[atp_production_and_consumption_in_glycolysis | ATP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

While many numbers can be classified as [[definition_of_rational_numbers | rational numbers]] because they can be expressed as a ratio of two integers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, some numbers cannot be represented in this way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. These are known as irrational numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

## Characteristics of Irrational Numbers

Unlike [[representation_of_rational_numbers_as_fractions | rational numbers]], which can be expressed as finite or [[repeating_decimals_as_rational_numbers | repeating decimals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, irrational numbers have decimal representations that:
*   Never terminate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   Never repeat in a pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

## Famous Examples

Some of the most well-known numbers in mathematics are irrational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. These numbers often "pop out of nature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

*   **Pi (π)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>: This constant represents the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Its decimal expansion goes on forever without repeating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **e** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>: Similar to Pi, 'e' never terminates or repeats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. It appears in various mathematical contexts like continuously compounding interest and complex analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   **Square Root of 2 (√2)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>: The square root of any non-perfect square will result in an irrational number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   **Phi (Φ)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>: Also known as the Golden Ratio, Phi is another example of an irrational number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

## Prevalence of Irrational Numbers

Despite their exotic nature, irrational numbers are not uncommon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

*   There is always at least one, and in fact an infinite number, of irrational numbers between any two rational numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   This implies that there aren't fewer irrational numbers than rational numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

## Operations Involving Irrational Numbers

The interaction of irrational numbers with [[definition_of_rational_numbers | rational numbers]] reveals further properties:
*   The sum of an irrational number and a rational number will always be irrational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   The product of an irrational number and a rational number will also always be irrational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

These properties demonstrate the abundance of irrational numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

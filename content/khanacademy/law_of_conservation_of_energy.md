The concepts of work and energy are fundamental in physics, though their definitions can seem circular when described purely with words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. While familiar in everyday life, their meaning in a physics context is more specific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Defining Work and Energy

In physics, [[concept_of_work_in_physics | work]] is defined as [[definition_and_understanding_of_energy | energy]] transferred by a force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This definition helps explain how a force can impart or change the energy of an object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

[[definition_and_understanding_of_energy | Energy]], in turn, is defined as the ability to do [[concept_of_work_in_physics | work]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. This interdependency means the concepts are used to define each other, highlighting their close relationship rather than independent notions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Quantitative Understanding: Work

To gain a more quantitative understanding, [[concept_of_work_in_physics | work]] in mechanics is expressed mathematically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

Work = Force × Distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>

For example, if a force of 10 Newtons is applied to a block, moving it 7 meters, the [[concept_of_work_in_physics | work]] done is calculated as:
Work = 10 Newtons × 7 meters = 70 Newton meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>

The unit of [[concept_of_work_in_physics | work]] (and [[definition_and_understanding_of_energy | energy]]) is the Joule (J) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. One Newton meter is equivalent to one Joule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

## Kinetic Energy

When [[concept_of_work_in_physics | work]] is done on an object, especially to accelerate it, the object gains a form of [[definition_and_understanding_of_energy | energy]] known as [[kinetic_energy_formula | kinetic energy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>. [[kinetic_energy_formula | Kinetic energy]] is the [[definition_and_understanding_of_energy | energy]] an object possesses due to its motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>.

### Derivation of Kinetic Energy Formula

Consider a block of mass 'm' at rest. A force 'F' is applied, accelerating it over a distance 'd' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.
From kinematics, the final velocity (v) of an object starting from rest, accelerating over a distance 'd' is given by:
v² = 2ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>

From Newton's second law, Force (F) = mass (m) × acceleration (a), so acceleration (a) = F/m <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.
Substituting 'a' into the kinematic equation:
v² = 2 (F/m) d <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>
Multiply both sides by 'm':
mv² = 2Fd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>

Since [[concept_of_work_in_physics | work]] (W) = Fd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>:
mv² = 2W <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>
Rearranging to solve for Work:
W = ½ mv² <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>

This equation defines the [[kinetic_energy_formula | kinetic energy]] (KE) of an object, representing the [[concept_of_work_in_physics | work]] needed to accelerate it from rest to its current velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>. The unit of [[kinetic_energy_formula | kinetic energy]] is also Joules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>.

## Outlook

Understanding different forms of [[definition_and_understanding_of_energy | energy]], such as [[kinetic_energy_formula | kinetic energy]], is crucial for later comprehending the [[Workenergy theorem | law of conservation of energy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>. This law describes how [[definition_and_understanding_of_energy | energy]] can be converted between different forms, enabling predictions about object behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>. Further exploration into other forms of [[definition_and_understanding_of_energy | energy]] and the [[Workenergy theorem | law of conservation of energy]] will follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>.

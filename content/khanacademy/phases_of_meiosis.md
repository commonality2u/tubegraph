[[process_and_phases_of_meiosis | Meiosis]] is a specialized type of [[detailed_cell_division_process_in_meiosis | cell division]] that occurs in germ cells to produce gametes, facilitating [[role_of_meiosis_in_sexual_reproduction | sexual reproduction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. Unlike [[process_and_phases_of_mitosis | mitosis]], which starts with a diploid cell and ends with two diploid cells through duplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, [[process_and_phases_of_meiosis | meiosis]] involves two rounds of division, resulting in four haploid cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

## Interphase

Before [[process_and_phases_of_meiosis | meiosis]] (or [[process_and_phases_of_mitosis | mitosis]]) begins, a cell spends most of its time in interphase, a period of living and transcribing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. During the S phase of interphase, the cell's DNA replicates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>. Each chromosome, which exists as unwound chromatin during interphase, duplicates, forming two sister chromatids connected by a centromere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>. For [[process_and_phases_of_meiosis | meiosis]], it's important to consider homologous pairs of chromosomes, with one chromosome from each parent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. Homologous chromosomes code for the same genes but may have different alleles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>. Also during interphase, the centrosomes, which generate spindle fibers, replicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.

## Meiosis I (M1)

The first round of [[process_and_phases_of_meiosis | meiosis]] is referred to as [[detailed_cell_division_process_in_meiosis | Meiosis]] I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. In this stage, the diploid cell essentially splits into two haploid cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. The substages are prophase I, metaphase I, anaphase I, and telophase I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>.

### Prophase I

In prophase I, several key events occur:
*   The nuclear envelope begins to disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>.
*   The centrosomes start pushing apart and facilitating the development of spindle fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>.
*   The chromatin condenses and forms into visible chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>.
*   Crucially, homologous pairs of chromosomes line up next to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>.
*   **Genetic Recombination (Crossing Over)**: The homologous chromosomes can exchange segments of their DNA through a process called crossing over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:00">[10:34:00]</a>. This occurs at homologous points, ensuring the exchange of similar genes but potentially different alleles, significantly contributing to genetic variation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>.

### Metaphase I

In metaphase I, the nuclear envelope is fully gone, and the centrosomes have migrated to opposite sides of the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09:00">[13:09:00]</a>. Spindle fibers, generated by the centrosomes, attach to the kinetochores on the centromeres of the chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:46:00">[14:46:00]</a>. The homologous pairs align at the metaphase plate (the center of the cell) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a>. The orientation of each homologous pair at the metaphase plate is random, adding to genetic variation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:00">[14:15:00]</a>.

### Anaphase I

During anaphase I, the homologous chromosomes are pulled apart towards opposite poles of the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:08:00">[15:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22:00">[15:22:00]</a>. A key [[differences_between_mitosis_and_meiosis | difference]] from [[process_and_phases_of_mitosis | mitosis]] is that the sister chromatids remain attached at their centromeres and do not separate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:13:00">[15:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:28:00">[15:28:00]</a>.

### Telophase I

In telophase I, the separated homologous chromosomes arrive at their respective poles of the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:48:00">[16:48:00]</a>. The microtubules begin to disassemble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:15:00">[17:15:00]</a>, and the nuclear envelope starts to reform around each set of chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:42:00">[17:42:00]</a>. Concurrently, cytokinesis (the division of the cytoplasm) occurs, pinching the cell in two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:29:00">[17:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:52:00">[17:52:00]</a>. The result is two haploid cells, each containing chromosomes composed of two sister chromatids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:02:00">[18:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:13:00">[18:13:00]</a>.

## Meiosis II (M2)

After [[detailed_cell_division_process_in_meiosis | Meiosis]] I, there may be a brief interphase II where centrosomes duplicate again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:32:00">[18:32:00]</a>. Meiosis II is very similar to [[process_and_phases_of_mitosis | mitosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:26:00">[18:26:00]</a>. Each of the two cells from [[detailed_cell_division_process_in_meiosis | Meiosis]] I undergoes this second division. The substages are prophase II, metaphase II, anaphase II, and telophase II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>.

### Prophase II

In prophase II, the nuclear envelope that formed in telophase I disintegrates again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:47:00">[19:47:00]</a>. The centrosomes, having replicated, move to opposite poles of each cell and generate spindle fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:06:00">[20:06:00]</a>.

### Metaphase II

During metaphase II, the chromosomes (each still composed of two sister chromatids) align at the metaphase plate in each of the two cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:42:00">[20:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:49:00">[20:49:00]</a>. Spindle fibers attach to the kinetochores on the centromeres of each sister chromatid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:58:00">[21:58:00]</a>.

### Anaphase II

Anaphase II is similar to [[process_and_phases_of_mitosis | anaphase in mitosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:17:00">[22:17:00]</a>. The sister chromatids finally separate from each other and are pulled to opposite poles of the cell by the spindle fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:48:00">[22:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:34:00">[23:34:00]</a>. Once separated, each chromatid is considered an individual chromosome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:43:00">[23:43:00]</a>.

### Telophase II

In telophase II, the chromosomes arrive at the poles of the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:49:00">[24:49:00]</a>. The cell elongates, and cytokinesis occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:00:00">[25:00:00]</a>. Nuclear envelopes reform around the sets of chromosomes at each pole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:15:00">[25:15:00]</a>. The microtubules disintegrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:13:00">[25:13:00]</a>. The end result of [[detailed_cell_division_process_in_meiosis | Meiosis]] II is four distinct haploid cells, each with a single set of chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:11:00">[27:11:00]</a>. These haploid cells are called gametes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:15:00">[27:15:00]</a>.

For a general overview of [[comparison_of_mitosis_and_meiosis | differences between mitosis and meiosis]], it's important to note the distinct outcomes in terms of chromosome number and genetic identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. [[differences_in_genetic_outcomes_between_mitosis_and_meiosis | Meiosis]] leads to genetic variation through crossing over and random alignment of homologous pairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:18:00">[18:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:56:00">[26:56:00]</a>, which is crucial for [[role_of_meiosis_in_sexual_reproduction | sexual reproduction]] and the diversity of a gene pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20:00">[14:20:00]</a>.

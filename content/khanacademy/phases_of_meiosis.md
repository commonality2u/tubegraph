Meiosis is a fundamental process in [[gametogenesis | germ cells]] that leads to the production of gametes, which are essential for sexual reproduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Unlike [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]], which typically results in two diploid cells that are duplicates of the original <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, meiosis involves two rounds of division, ultimately producing four haploid cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Interphase

Before meiosis begins, a germ cell spends most of its time in [[cellular_respiration_phases | interphase]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. During this phase, the cell is performing its normal functions, such as transcribing genes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. A critical event that prepares the cell for division occurs in the S phase of interphase: the [[process_of_dna_replication | replication of DNA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Each chromosome, which existed as unwound chromatin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, replicates to form two sister chromatids connected by a centromere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. The centrosomes, which help organize spindle fibers, also duplicate during this time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. For meiosis, it's crucial to visualize [[role_of_homologous_pairs_in_meiosis | homologous pairs]] of chromosomes (one inherited from each parent) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

## Meiosis I (Reductional Division)

Meiosis I is the first round of division, where a diploid cell splits into two haploid cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This stage is characterized by the separation of [[role_of_homologous_pairs_in_meiosis | homologous pairs]] of chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.

### Prophase I
This is the longest and most complex phase of meiosis I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   The nuclear envelope begins to disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
*   Chromatin condenses into visible chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
*   Centrosomes migrate to opposite poles and begin forming spindle fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   [[role_of_homologous_pairs_in_meiosis | Homologous chromosomes]] pair up in a process called synapsis, forming a bivalent or tetrad (due to having four chromatids) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
*   [[genetic_recombination | Crossing over]] occurs, where homologous chromosomes exchange segments of genetic material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. This exchange happens at specific points called chiasmata <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a> and is a key mechanism for increasing [[genetic_recombination | genetic variation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.

### Metaphase I
*   The homologous pairs align at the metaphase plate (the equatorial plane of the cell) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.
*   Spindle fibers from opposite poles attach to the kinetochores on the centromeres of each homologous chromosome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. The orientation of each homologous pair at the metaphase plate is random, further contributing to [[genetic_recombination | genetic variation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.

### Anaphase I
*   [[role_of_homologous_pairs_in_meiosis | Homologous chromosomes]] are pulled apart by the shortening spindle fibers towards opposite poles of the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.
*   Crucially, the sister chromatids remain attached at their centromeres and move as a single unit to the poles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. This is a key difference from [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>.

### Telophase I
*   The separated homologous chromosomes arrive at opposite poles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.
*   The nuclear envelope may reform around the chromosomes at each pole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.
*   Spindle fibers disassemble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.
*   [[cytokinesis | Cytokinesis]] (the division of the cytoplasm) occurs, resulting in two haploid daughter cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. Each daughter cell now contains half the number of chromosomes as the original diploid cell, but each chromosome still consists of two sister chromatids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.

## Meiosis II (Equational Division)

Meiosis II is similar to [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]] in that sister chromatids separate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>.

### Interkinesis (Interphase II)
Sometimes, there is a short interphase II between meiosis I and meiosis II where the cell rests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. However, [[process_of_dna_replication | DNA replication]] does **not** occur again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. Centrosomes duplicate again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>.

### Prophase II
*   The nuclear envelope (if reformed) disintegrates again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.
*   Centrosomes migrate to opposite poles and new spindle fibers form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.

### Metaphase II
*   The chromosomes (each still composed of two sister chromatids) align individually along the metaphase plate of each cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>.
*   Spindle fibers attach to the kinetochores on opposite sides of the centromere of each sister chromatid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>.

### Anaphase II
*   The centromeres connecting the sister chromatids divide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>.
*   Sister chromatids are pulled apart and move to opposite poles, now considered individual chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>. This is analogous to anaphase in [[overview_of_mitosis | mitosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>.

### Telophase II
*   Chromosomes arrive at opposite poles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>.
*   Nuclear envelopes reform around the sets of chromosomes at each pole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>.
*   Spindle fibers disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>.
*   [[cytokinesis | Cytokinesis]] occurs, dividing each of the two cells into two new daughter cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>.

The final result of [[overview_of_meiosis | meiosis]] is four genetically distinct haploid cells (gametes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>. These cells contain half the number of chromosomes of the original diploid cell, with each chromosome consisting of a single chromatid. This process, including [[genetic_recombination | crossing over]] and random assortment of chromosomes during metaphase I, introduces significant [[genetic_recombination | genetic variation]] into the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.

When solving quadratic equations, the solutions (or roots/zeroes) represent the points where the function's graph intersects the x-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. The [[introduction_to_the_quadratic_formula | quadratic formula]] provides a method to find these solutions algebraically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>, and [[graphing_quadratic_functions_and_identifying_their_parabolic_shape | graphing quadratic functions and identifying their parabolic shape]] offers a visual understanding of these solutions.

## Understanding Real Solutions Graphically

A quadratic equation in the form `ax² + bx + c = 0` describes a parabola when graphed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. The solutions to this equation are the x-values where the parabola crosses or touches the x-axis.

## Case Study: No Real Solutions

Consider the equation `3x² + 6x + 10 = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>. Applying the [[solving_quadratic_equations_using_the_quadratic_formula | quadratic formula]] to this equation leads to a scenario where the term under the square root (`b² - 4ac`), known as the discriminant, is negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>. In this specific example, it resulted in `sqrt(-84)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] No Real Solutions
> If the term `b² - 4ac` is negative, the quadratic equation will have no real solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>. This means there are no real numbers for `x` that satisfy the equation.

Graphically, this situation is depicted by a parabola that does not intersect the x-axis at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>. For `3x² + 6x + 10 = 0`, the graph shows a parabola that opens upwards, with its vertex positioned above the x-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>. As such, the function `y = 3x² + 6x + 10` never equals zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:00">[10:34:00]</a>, confirming that there are no real solutions where `y=0`.

## Case Study: Two Real Solutions

For an equation like `x² + 4x - 21 = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>, the [[solving_quadratic_equations_using_the_quadratic_formula | quadratic formula]] yielded two real solutions: `x = 3` and `x = -7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>. This implies that the graph of `y = x² + 4x - 21` would intersect the x-axis at these two points. This can be verified by [[factoring_quadratic_expressions | factoring quadratic expressions]] as well, which also yields `x = 3` and `x = -7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>.

Another example, `-3x² + 12x + 1 = 0`, also results in two real solutions using the [[solving_quadratic_equations_using_the_quadratic_formula | quadratic formula]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>. When graphed, the parabola for `y = -3x² + 12x + 1` intersects the x-axis at two distinct points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:37:00">[15:37:00]</a>. These intersection points correspond to the calculated solutions, one being approximately `4` and the other a little less than `1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:00">[16:06:00]</a>.

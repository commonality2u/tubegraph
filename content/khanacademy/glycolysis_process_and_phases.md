[[overview_of_glycolysis | Glycolysis]] is the first of roughly three phases in [[stages_of_cellular_respiration | cellular respiration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The term "glycolysis" literally means the breaking down of glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This process can occur with or without oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. If oxygen is absent, the process leads to fermentation, which produces lactic acid in humans and alcohol or ethanol in other organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. If oxygen is present, [[glycolysis_process_and_its_role_in_breaking_down_glucose | glycolysis]] proceeds to the Krebs cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, and then to the electron transport chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Overview of Glycolysis
[[glycolysis_process_and_its_role_in_breaking_down_glucose | Glycolysis]] begins with glucose, which has a chemical formula of C₆H₁₂O₆ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The focus is primarily on the carbon backbone, which can be thought of as six carbons in a row <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. The overall aim of [[stages_of_cellular_respiration | cellular respiration]] is to generate [[atp_production_in_glycolysis | ATPs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

The main outputs of [[glycolysis_process_and_its_role_in_breaking_down_glucose | glycolysis]] are:
*   **Two [[atp_production_in_glycolysis | ATPs]] (net)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>
*   **Two [[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | NADHs]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>
*   **Two pyruvates** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>

## Phases of Glycolysis
[[steps_and_reactions_in_glycolysis | Glycolysis]] involves two important phases:

### 1. Investment Phase
The investment phase requires the use of [[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | two ATPs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. In this phase, the glucose molecule is broken down into two 3-carbon compounds, each with a phosphate group attached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. These phosphate groups originate from the [[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | ATPs]] that were used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. These 3-carbon compounds are often called PGAL, or phosphoglyceraldehyde, or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

### 2. Payoff Phase
Each of the two PGAL molecules proceeds into the payoff phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. In this phase, each PGAL is converted into pyruvate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Pyruvate is another 3-carbon compound, sometimes referred to as pyruvic acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

During the conversion of PGAL to pyruvate:
*   Each PGAL produces [[atp_production_in_glycolysis | two ATPs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Since there are two PGALs, a gross total of [[atp_production_in_glycolysis | four ATPs]] are produced in the payoff phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
*   Each PGAL also produces one [[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | NADH]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. This occurs as [[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | NAD]]+ is reduced to [[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | NADH]] by gaining a hydrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Since there are two PGALs, a total of [[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | two NADHs]] are produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. These [[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | NADHs]] will later be utilized in the electron transport chain to generate more [[atp_production_in_glycolysis | ATPs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

## Overall Net Yield
Considering both phases, the net yield from one molecule of glucose through [[glycolysis_process_and_its_role_in_breaking_down_glucose | glycolysis]] is:
*   **Net [[atp_production_in_glycolysis | ATP]] production**: [[atp_production_in_glycolysis | Four ATPs]] produced in the payoff phase minus [[atp_production_in_glycolysis | two ATPs]] invested, resulting in a net gain of **two [[atp_production_in_glycolysis | ATPs]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   **[[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | NADH]] production**: **Two [[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | NADHs]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.
*   **Pyruvate production**: **Two pyruvates** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

These pyruvates will subsequently be re-engineered into acetyl-CoAs, which serve as raw materials for the Krebs cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. During [[glycolysis_process_and_its_role_in_breaking_down_glucose | glycolysis]], the carbon in glucose gets oxidized as some hydrogens are stripped off, and carbons bond more strongly with oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.

When dividing larger numbers, it's common for a number not to divide "cleanly" into another, meaning there's something left over. This "left over" amount is known as a remainder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Understanding [[importance_of_multiplication_tables_in_division | multiplication tables]] is crucial for handling these types of problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Identifying When a Remainder Occurs

A remainder occurs when the number you are dividing into is not an exact multiple of the number you are dividing by <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. For instance, if you're dividing 23 by 3, you would notice that 23 is not found in the multiples of 3 (3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

## Calculating a Remainder

To find a remainder:
1.  **Find the largest multiple:** Determine the largest multiple of the divisor that is less than or equal to the number being divided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
    *   For example, with 23 divided by 3, the largest multiple of 3 that goes into 23 is 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
    *   You know that 3 times 7 equals 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. So, 3 goes into 23 seven times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
2.  **Subtract the multiple:** Subtract this multiple from the original number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
    *   Continuing the example, 23 minus 21 leaves 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
3.  **The result is the remainder:** The result of this subtraction is the remainder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## Expressing the Answer with a Remainder

When a division problem doesn't result in a whole number, you can express the answer using a remainder. For the example of 23 divided by 3, the answer would be "7 remainder 2" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. This indicates that 3 goes into 23 seven times, with 2 left over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

## Application in Larger Division Problems

The concept of remainders is fundamental to [[basic_steps_in_long_division | long division]] with larger numbers. When performing long division, you repeatedly divide, find the largest multiple, subtract to find a partial remainder, and then bring down the next digit to continue the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. If, at the end of the process, the final subtraction results in a number greater than zero, that number is the remainder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. If it's zero, there is no remainder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] 4 goes into 344
> 1.  **Divide the first part:** 4 goes into 3 zero times. Move to 34 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
> 2.  **Divide 34:** The largest multiple of 4 that goes into 34 is 32 (4 x 8) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Write "8" in the tens place above the 4 in 344 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
> 3.  **Subtract and find partial remainder:** 34 minus 32 equals 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. This 2 actually represents 20, as it's in the tens column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
> 4.  **Bring down the next digit:** Bring down the 4 from 344 to form 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
> 5.  **Divide the new number:** 4 goes into 24 exactly 6 times (4 x 6 = 24) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. Write "6" in the ones place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
> 6.  **Final subtraction:** 24 minus 24 equals 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
>
> Since the final remainder is 0, 4 goes into 344 exactly eighty-six times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] 7 goes into 91
> 1.  **Divide the first part:** 7 goes into 9 one time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. Write "1" in the tens place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
> 2.  **Subtract and find partial remainder:** 9 minus 7 equals 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. This represents 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
> 3.  **Bring down the next digit:** Bring down the 1 to form 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
> 4.  **Divide the new number:** 7 goes into 21 three times (7 x 3 = 21) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Write "3" in the ones place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
> 5.  **Final subtraction:** 21 minus 21 equals 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
>
> Therefore, 91 divided by 7 is exactly 13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

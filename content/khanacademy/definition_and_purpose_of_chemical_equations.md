[[Balancing chemical equations | Balancing chemical equations]] is a fundamental concept in chemistry that ensures accuracy in describing reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## What is a Chemical Equation?
A [[introduction_to_chemical_equations | chemical equation]] is a representation that describes a reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. It shows the substances that react, known as reactants, and the substances formed, known as products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

For example, a reaction where an atom of aluminum reacts with a dioxygen molecule (O₂) to form aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) can be described by a [[introduction_to_chemical_equations | chemical equation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

```
Al + O₂ → Al₂O₃
```

## Why Balance Chemical Equations?
The core purpose of [[balancing_chemical_equations | balancing chemical equations]] is to ensure that the number of atoms of each element is the same on both the reactant (left-hand) side and the product (right-hand) side of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This upholds the principle that atoms cannot simply appear or disappear during a chemical reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

### Identifying Imbalances
Consider the example equation:
`Al + O₂ → Al₂O₃`

*   **Aluminum (Al):** On the left side, there is one aluminum atom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. On the right side (in aluminum oxide), there are two aluminum atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This is an imbalance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Oxygen (O):** On the left side, the dioxygen molecule contains two oxygen atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. On the right side, the aluminum oxide molecule contains three oxygen atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This is also an imbalance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

To properly represent the reaction, the number of aluminum and oxygen atoms must be balanced on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Convention for Coefficients
When [[balancing_chemical_equations | balancing chemical equations]], coefficients are added in front of molecules to indicate the number of units involved in the reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. These coefficients must be whole numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. It is not conventional to use fractions or decimals (e.g., "1.5 molecules") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

To resolve fractional coefficients, similar to algebraic equations, all coefficients in the equation can be multiplied by a common number to convert them to whole numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. For instance, if a coefficient of 1.5 appears, multiplying all coefficients by two will convert it to a whole number (3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### Example of a Balanced Equation
Using the aluminum and dioxygen reaction as an example:

1.  Initial attempt to balance Aluminum: `2Al + O₂ → Al₂O₃`
    *   Aluminum: 2 on left, 2 on right. (Balanced)
    *   Oxygen: 2 on left, 3 on right. (Unbalanced) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>

2.  To balance oxygen, one might consider multiplying O₂ by 1.5 (1.5 * 2 = 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. This gives `2Al + 1.5O₂ → Al₂O₃`.
    *   However, 1.5 is not a whole number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

3.  Multiply all coefficients by 2 to eliminate the decimal:
    *   (2 * 2)Al + (1.5 * 2)O₂ → (1 * 2)Al₂O₃
    *   Result: `4Al + 3O₂ → 2Al₂O₃` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>

### Verification of Balance
With the balanced equation `4Al + 3O₂ → 2Al₂O₃`:

*   **Aluminum (Al):**
    *   Left side: 4 atoms (4 * Al) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>
    *   Right side: 4 atoms (2 * Al₂) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>
*   **Oxygen (O):**
    *   Left side: 6 atoms (3 * O₂) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>
    *   Right side: 6 atoms (2 * O₃) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>

Both elements are now balanced on both sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

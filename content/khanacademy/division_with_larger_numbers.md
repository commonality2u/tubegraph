To successfully [[dividing_to_solve_equations | divide]] into larger numbers, a foundational understanding of [[importance_of_multiplication_tables_in_division | multiplication tables]] is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. It is recommended to know tables from 1x1 up to at least 10x10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, though some individuals learn up to 12x12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Basic Division Using Multiplication Tables

For simple [[stepbystep_process_for_basic_division_problems | division problems]], one can quickly find the answer by recalling [[importance_of_multiplication_tables_in_division | multiplication tables]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

*   **Example 1: 25 divided by 5**
    To solve 25 รท 5, consider "5 times what equals 25?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Since 5 x 5 = 25, the answer is 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The 5 should be written in the ones place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   **Example 2: 49 divided by 7**
    Similarly, for 49 รท 7, ask "7 times what equals 49?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Knowing that 7 x 7 = 49 gives the answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **Example 3: 54 divided by 9**
    For 54 รท 9, think "9 times what equals 54?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. If 9 x 5 = 45, then adding 9 more (9 x 6) equals 54 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. So, 9 goes into 54 six times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## [[handling_division_with_remainders | Handling Division with Remainders]]

Not all [[dividing_to_solve_equations | division]] problems result in a whole number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. In such cases, there will be a remainder.

*   **Example: 23 divided by 3**
    *   List multiples of 3: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
    *   There is no exact multiple of 3 that equals 23 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
    *   Find the largest multiple of 3 that is less than or equal to 23, which is 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
    *   3 goes into 21 seven times (3 x 7 = 21) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
    *   Subtract 21 from 23 to find the remainder: 23 - 21 = 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
    *   So, 23 divided by 3 is 7 with a remainder of 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This means it goes in cleanly 7 times, with 2 left over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

## [[introduction_to_long_division | Long Division]] with Larger Numbers

For much larger numbers, a systematic approach called [[introduction_to_long_division | long division]] is used. This method breaks down the problem into smaller, manageable steps, primarily relying on your [[importance_of_multiplication_tables_in_division | multiplication tables]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

### [[stepbystep_process_for_basic_division_problems | Step-by-Step Process for Basic Division Problems]]

The general procedure involves dividing digit by digit from left to right.

*   **Example 1: Dividing 344 by 4**
    1.  **First digit**: How many times does 4 go into 3? It goes in 0 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
    2.  **First two digits**: Consider the first two digits, 34. How many times does 4 go into 34? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>
        *   4 x 8 = 32 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>
        *   4 x 9 = 36 (too large) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>
        *   So, 4 goes into 34 eight times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Write '8' above the '4' in 344 (in the tens place) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
    3.  **Multiply and Subtract**: Multiply the quotient digit (8) by the divisor (4): 8 x 4 = 32 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Write '32' below '34' and subtract: 34 - 32 = 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. This '2' represents 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
    4.  **Bring down the next digit**: Bring down the last digit '4' from 344 next to the 2, forming 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
    5.  **Repeat**: How many times does 4 go into 24? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>
        *   4 x 6 = 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
        *   Write '6' above the '4' in 344 (in the ones place) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
    6.  **Final Multiply and Subtract**: Multiply 6 by 4: 6 x 4 = 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Subtract from 24: 24 - 24 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
    7.  **Result**: The remainder is 0. So, 344 divided by 4 is exactly 86 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

*   **Example 2: Dividing 91 by 7**
    1.  **First digit**: How many times does 7 go into 9? One time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. Write '1' above the '9'.
    2.  **Multiply and Subtract**: 1 x 7 = 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. 9 - 7 = 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
    3.  **Bring down**: Bring down the '1', making it 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
    4.  **Repeat**: How many times does 7 go into 21? Three times (7 x 3 = 21) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. Write '3' above the '1'.
    5.  **Final Subtract**: 3 x 7 = 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. 21 - 21 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
    6.  **Result**: 91 divided by 7 is 13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

*   **Example 3: Dividing 608 by 8**
    1.  **First digit**: How many times does 8 go into 6? Zero times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
    2.  **First two digits**: How many times does 8 go into 60? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>
        *   8 x 7 = 56 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>
        *   8 x 8 = 64 (too big) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>
        *   So, 8 goes into 60 seven times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. Write '7' above the '0' in 608 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
    3.  **Multiply and Subtract**: 7 x 8 = 56 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. 60 - 56 = 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
    4.  **Bring down**: Bring down the '8', making it 48 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
    5.  **Repeat**: How many times does 8 go into 48? Six times (8 x 6 = 48) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. Write '6' above the '8'.
    6.  **Final Subtract**: 6 x 8 = 48 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. 48 - 48 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
    7.  **Result**: 608 divided by 8 is 76 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

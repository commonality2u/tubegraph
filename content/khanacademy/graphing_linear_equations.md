A [[linear_equations|linear equation]] can be [[representation_of_linear_equations|represented]] in many ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. For example, `y = 2x + 3` is one representation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, but it can be algebraically manipulated into an infinite number of equivalent forms, such as `-2x + y = 3` or `y - 5 = 2(x - 1)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. All these forms are equivalent and can be derived from one another through logical algebraic operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

One particularly useful way to [[representation_of_linear_equations|represent]] a [[linear_equations|linear equation]] for [[graphical_representation_of_linear_equations|graphing]] is the [[slope_intercept_form_of_a_linear_equation|slope-intercept form]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## [[slope_intercept_form_of_a_linear_equation|Slope-Intercept Form]]

The [[slope_intercept_form_of_a_linear_equation|slope-intercept form]] of a [[linear_equations|linear equation]] is typically written as `y = mx + b` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This form makes it very easy to determine both the [[yintercept_and_slope_of_a_linear_equation|y-intercept]] and the [[yintercept_and_slope_of_a_linear_equation|slope]] of the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

*   The constant 'b' represents the [[yintercept_and_slope_of_a_linear_equation|y-intercept]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
*   The coefficient 'm' (the number multiplying 'x') represents the [[yintercept_and_slope_of_a_linear_equation|slope]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

### Graphing `y = 2x + 3`

To [[graphical_representation_of_linear_equations|graph]] an equation in [[slope_intercept_form_of_a_linear_equation|slope-intercept form]], one can plot points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

1.  **Find the [[yintercept_and_slope_of_a_linear_equation|Y-Intercept]]**:
    *   Set `x = 0` to find the corresponding `y` value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
    *   For `y = 2x + 3`, when `x = 0`, `y = 2(0) + 3`, which simplifies to `y = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
    *   The point `(0, 3)` is the [[yintercept_and_slope_of_a_linear_equation|y-intercept]], meaning the line crosses the y-axis at this point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

2.  **Determine the [[yintercept_and_slope_of_a_linear_equation|Slope]]**:
    *   The [[yintercept_and_slope_of_a_linear_equation|slope]] is the coefficient of `x`, which is `2` in `y = 2x + 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
    *   [[yintercept_and_slope_of_a_linear_equation|Slope]] is defined as "change in y over change in x" (`Δy/Δx`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
    *   A [[yintercept_and_slope_of_a_linear_equation|slope]] of `2` (or `2/1`) means that for every `1` unit increase in `x`, `y` increases by `2` units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
        *   If `x` increases by `1` (from `0` to `1`), `y` increases by `2` (from `3` to `5`), so `(1, 5)` is another point on the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
        *   If `x` increases by `1` again (from `1` to `2`), `y` increases by `2` (from `5` to `7`), so `(2, 7)` is also on the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
        *   Conversely, if `x` decreases by `1` (from `0` to `-1`), `y` decreases by `2` (from `3` to `1`), placing `(-1, 1)` on the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

3.  **Draw the Line**:
    *   Plot the [[yintercept_and_slope_of_a_linear_equation|y-intercept]] `(0, 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
    *   Plot another point determined by the [[yintercept_and_slope_of_a_linear_equation|slope]], such as `(1, 5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
    *   Two points are sufficient to define and draw a straight line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

### Another Example: `y = -x + 2`

[[slope_intercept_form_of_a_linear_equation|Slope-intercept form]] allows for quick [[graphical_representation_of_linear_equations|graphing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>:
*   The [[yintercept_and_slope_of_a_linear_equation|y-intercept]] is `(0, 2)` (from the `+ 2` term) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
*   The [[yintercept_and_slope_of_a_linear_equation|slope]] is `-1` (from the `-x` term, which is `-1x`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. This means for every `1` unit increase in `x`, `y` decreases by `1` unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

From [[slope_intercept_form_of_a_linear_equation|slope-intercept form]], it is very easy to determine both the [[yintercept_and_slope_of_a_linear_equation|y-intercept]] and the [[yintercept_and_slope_of_a_linear_equation|slope]] of a [[linear_equations|linear equation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

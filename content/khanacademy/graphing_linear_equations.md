A [[linear_equations_representation | linear equation]] can be represented in an infinite number of ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. For example, the equation `y = 2x + 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a> can also be written as `-2x + y = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a> or `y - 5 = 2(x - 1)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. All these forms are equivalent and can be converted from one to another using algebraic operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Slope-Intercept Form

One particularly useful way to represent a [[understanding_linear_equations | linear equation]] for [[graphing using slope and intercept | graphing]] is the **slope-intercept form** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This form explicitly solves for `y`, appearing as `y = mx + b`, where `m` and `b` are constants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

### Identifying the Y-Intercept

In the slope-intercept form (`y = mx + b`), the constant term `b` directly tells you the y-intercept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. The y-intercept is the point where the line crosses the y-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. This occurs when `x` is equal to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

**Example: `y = 2x + 3`**
To find the y-intercept, set `x = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
If `x = 0`, then `y = 2(0) + 3`, which simplifies to `y = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
So, the y-intercept is the point `(0, 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### Identifying the Slope

The coefficient `m` in the slope-intercept form (`y = mx + b`) represents the **slope** of the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. The slope is the ratio of the change in `y` (vertical change) to the change in `x` (horizontal change) between any two points on the line (`Δy / Δx`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

**Example: `y = 2x + 3`**
The coefficient of `x` is `2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   If `x` increases by `1`, `y` increases by `2` (since `2 * 1 = 2`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
    *   From `(0, 3)`, if `x` increases by `1` to `(1)`, `y` becomes `2(1) + 3 = 5`. So the point `(1, 5)` is on the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. The change in `y` (`Δy`) is `5 - 3 = 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   The slope is `Δy / Δx = 2 / 1 = 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

If `x` increases by one, `y` will increase by the slope value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

## Steps for Graphing a Linear Equation in Slope-Intercept Form

1.  **Identify the y-intercept**: This is the `b` value in `y = mx + b`. Plot the point `(0, b)` on the y-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
2.  **Identify the slope**: This is the `m` value in `y = mx + b`. Remember slope is `Δy / Δx` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
3.  **Use the slope to find a second point**: Starting from the y-intercept, move `Δx` units horizontally (right for positive, left for negative) and then `Δy` units vertically (up for positive, down for negative) to find another point on the line.
4.  **Draw the line**: Connect the two points with a straight line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

### Example Walkthrough: `y = 2x + 3`

1.  **Y-intercept**: `b = 3`. Plot `(0, 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
2.  **Slope**: `m = 2`. This can be thought of as `2/1` (`Δy / Δx`).
3.  **Second point**: From `(0, 3)`, move `1` unit right (`Δx = 1`) and `2` units up (`Δy = 2`). This leads to the point `(0 + 1, 3 + 2) = (1, 5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
4.  **Draw the line**: Connect `(0, 3)` and `(1, 5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Another Example: `y = -x + 2`

1.  **Y-intercept**: `b = 2`. Plot `(0, 2)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
2.  **Slope**: `m = -1`. This can be thought of as `-1/1` (`Δy / Δx`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
3.  **Second point**: From `(0, 2)`, move `1` unit right (`Δx = 1`) and `1` unit down (`Δy = -1`). This leads to the point `(0 + 1, 2 - 1) = (1, 1)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
4.  **Draw the line**: Connect `(0, 2)` and `(1, 1)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

Using the slope-intercept form makes it very easy to visualize and graph a linear equation by directly identifying its y-intercept and slope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

[[word_problems_involving_systems_of_equations | Word problems]] in algebra involve translating real-world scenarios into mathematical equations to find unknown values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>. This often leads to a [[word_problems_involving_systems_of_equations | system of equations]], which can be solved using [[algebraic_methods_in_algebra | algebraic techniques]] rather than graphing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## The Substitution Method

The substitution method is an [[algebraic_methods_in_algebra | algebraic technique]] for solving [[word_problems_involving_systems_of_equations | systems of equations]] without needing to graph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This method provides an exact [[algebraic_methods_in_algebra | algebraic answer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

The core idea is to use one equation to solve for one variable, then substitute that expression into the other equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This reduces the problem to a single equation with a single unknown, which is then solvable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### Example: Solving a System of Equations

Consider the following system of equations:
1.  `x + 2y = 9` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
2.  `3x + 5y = 20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>

Steps to solve using substitution:

1.  **Solve one equation for one variable:** From the first equation, `x + 2y = 9`, subtract `2y` from both sides to get `x = 9 - 2y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This expression tells us what `x` must be equal to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
    ```
    x + 2y = 9
    x = 9 - 2y <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>
    ```

2.  **Substitute the expression into the second equation:** Replace `x` in the second equation (`3x + 5y = 20`) with the expression `(9 - 2y)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
    ```
    3(9 - 2y) + 5y = 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>
    ```

3.  **Solve the resulting single-variable equation:**
    *   Distribute the 3: `27 - 6y + 5y = 20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>
    *   Combine `y` terms: `27 - y = 20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>
    *   Subtract 27 from both sides: `-y = -7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>
    *   Multiply by -1: `y = 7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>

4.  **Substitute the found value back into the expression from Step 1 to find the other variable:**
    *   We know `x = 9 - 2y` and `y = 7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
    *   `x = 9 - 2(7)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>
    *   `x = 9 - 14` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>
    *   `x = -5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>

    The solution is `x = -5` and `y = 7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

5.  **[[Checking_solutions_in_algebra | Check the solution]]:**
    *   Equation 1: `-5 + 2(7) = -5 + 14 = 9`. This is correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
    *   Equation 2: `3(-5) + 5(7) = -15 + 35 = 20`. This is correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
    This means the point `(-5, 7)` is the intersection point if the equations were graphed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

## Solving Word Problems Using Substitution

[[word_problems_involving_systems_of_equations | Word problems]] require translating the given information into a [[word_problems_involving_systems_of_equations | system of equations]].

### Example: Sum and Difference of Two Numbers

**Problem:** The sum of two numbers is 70. They differ by 11. What are the numbers? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>

Steps to solve:

1.  **Define Variables:**
    *   Let `x` be the larger number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
    *   Let `y` be the smaller number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

2.  **Formulate Equations from Statements:**
    *   "The sum of two numbers is 70": `x + y = 70` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>
    *   "They differ by 11": `x - y = 11` (larger minus smaller) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>

    Now we have a [[word_problems_involving_systems_of_equations | system of two equations]] with two unknowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>:
    1.  `x + y = 70`
    2.  `x - y = 11`

3.  **Solve using the Substitution Method:**
    *   **Solve one equation for one variable:** From the second equation, `x - y = 11`, add `y` to both sides: `x = 11 + y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
    *   **Substitute into the other equation:** Substitute `(11 + y)` for `x` in the first equation (`x + y = 70`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
        ```
        (11 + y) + y = 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>
        ```
    *   **Solve the resulting single-variable equation:**
        *   Combine `y` terms: `11 + 2y = 70` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>
        *   Subtract 11 from both sides: `2y = 59` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>
        *   Divide by 2: `y = 59/2` or `y = 29.5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>

    *   **Substitute back to find the other variable:** Use `x = 11 + y` and `y = 29.5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
        *   `x = 11 + 29.5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>
        *   `x = 40.5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>

    The two numbers are `40.5` and `29.5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

4.  **[[Checking_solutions_in_algebra | Check the solution]]:**
    *   Sum: `40.5 + 29.5 = 70`. This is correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
    *   Difference: `40.5 - 29.5 = 11`. This is correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

    The solution satisfies both conditions of the [[word_problems_involving_systems_of_equations | word problem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

> [!tip] Using Both Constraints
> When solving a [[word_problems_involving_systems_of_equations | system of equations]], it is crucial to use both constraints (equations) to find the unique solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. You can choose which variable to solve for first and from which equation, but ensure both original equations contribute to the solution process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

Ratios are expressions that compare quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. They provide a way to describe how much of one item there is in relation to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Expressing Ratios

Ratios can be written in several equivalent ways:
*   Using a colon: 10:5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>
*   As a fraction: 10/5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>
*   Using the word "to": 10 to 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>

All these forms convey the same comparison between quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. The quantity written first or on top corresponds to the first item being compared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

### Order Matters
The order in which quantities are presented in a ratio is crucial. For example, if you have 10 horses and 5 dogs:
*   The ratio of horses to dogs is 10:5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   The ratio of dogs to horses is 5:10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

Whatever order the items are requested, the ratio should be presented in that same order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

## [[reducing_ratios | Reducing Ratios]]

Ratios are often simplified to their lowest terms, similar to fractions. This is done by dividing all quantities in the ratio by their greatest common divisor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### Example: Horses and Dogs
With 10 horses and 5 dogs, the ratio of horses to dogs is 10:5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
To reduce this:
1.  Find the greatest common divisor of 10 and 5, which is 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
2.  Divide both numbers by 5: 10 ÷ 5 = 2, and 5 ÷ 5 = 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
3.  The reduced ratio is 2:1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

This means for every 2 horses, there is 1 dog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The general convention is to express ratios in this [[reducing_ratios | reduced form]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

## [[ratios_with_multiple_quantities | Ratios with Multiple Quantities]]

Ratios can compare more than two quantities.
### Example: Fruits
If you have 20 apples, 40 oranges, and 60 strawberries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>:
1.  The initial ratio of apples:oranges:strawberries is 20:40:60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
2.  To reduce this, find the largest number that divides into all three quantities. In this case, it's 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
3.  Divide each number by 20: 20 ÷ 20 = 1, 40 ÷ 20 = 2, 60 ÷ 20 = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
4.  The [[ratios_with_multiple_quantities | reduced ratio]] is 1:2:3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

This means for every 1 apple, there are 2 oranges and 3 strawberries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

## [[using_ratios_to_solve_problems | Using Ratios to Solve Problems]]

Ratios can also be used to determine the actual number of quantities when a total is known.

### Example: Classroom Students
If the ratio of boys to girls in a classroom is 2:3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, and there are 40 students total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>, to find how many girls there are:

1.  **Understand the "group" size:** Add the parts of the ratio: 2 (boys) + 3 (girls) = 5 students per "group" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. This means for every 5 students, there are 2 boys and 3 girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
2.  **Calculate the number of groups:** Divide the total number of students by the "group" size: 40 students ÷ 5 students/group = 8 groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.
3.  **Determine the quantity:** Since each group has 3 girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>, multiply the number of groups by the number of girls per group: 8 groups × 3 girls/group = 24 girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

You can apply the same logic to find the number of boys: 8 groups × 2 boys/group = 16 boys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. (Alternatively, 40 total students - 24 girls = 16 boys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.)

### Example: Farm Animals (with three quantities)
If the ratio of sheep to chickens to pigs is 2:5:10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, and there are 51 animals in total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>, to find how many chickens there are:

1.  **Understand the "group" size:** Add the ratio parts: 2 (sheep) + 5 (chickens) + 10 (pigs) = 17 animals per "group" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.
2.  **Calculate the number of groups:** Divide the total animals by the "group" size: 51 animals ÷ 17 animals/group = 3 groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.
3.  **Determine the quantity:** Each group has 5 chickens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. So, 3 groups × 5 chickens/group = 15 chickens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.

This method applies regardless of the number of quantities in the ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

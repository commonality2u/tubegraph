Addition is a fundamental mathematical operation, though it may not initially seem "basic" to everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. With practice, understanding addition can become intuitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Methods for Addition

### Using Visuals

One way to understand [[basic_addition_with_visuals | basic addition]] is by using real-life objects or visual representations.

*   **Example: 1 + 1**
    If you have 1 avocado and are given another avocado, you now have 2 avocados <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. So, 1 plus 1 equals 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   **Example: 3 + 4**
    Starting with 3 avocados and adding 4 more avocados results in a total of 7 avocados <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Avocados are described as a very delicious and fatty fruit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Thus, 3 plus 4 equals 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

If you don't know the answer to an addition problem, you can always draw circles or other visual representations to count them up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

### Using a Number Line

Another effective method for addition is the [[number_line_for_addition | number line]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. To use a number line, you write all numbers in order, typically starting from 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

*   **Example: 3 + 4**
    To calculate 3 plus 4, start at 3 on the number line and move 4 units to the right (up the number line) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Moving 1, 2, 3, 4 units from 3 lands you on 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Therefore, 3 plus 4 is 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Example: 8 + 1**
    Starting at 8 on the number line and adding 1 means moving one unit to the right, landing on 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. So, 8 plus 1 equals 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Example: 5 + 6**
    For 5 plus 6, begin at 5 and move 6 units to the right on the number line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. This movement brings you to 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Thus, 5 plus 6 equals 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   **Example: 8 + 7**
    Starting at 8 and moving 7 units to the right on the number line leads to 15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. So, 8 plus 7 is 15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

## Properties of Addition

### Commutative Property

The [[commutative_property_of_addition | commutative property of addition]] states that changing the order of the numbers being added does not change the sum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

*   **Example: 6 + 5**
    As previously shown, 5 plus 6 is 11. If you start at 6 on the number line and add 5, you also arrive at 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. This demonstrates that 5 plus 6 is the same as 6 plus 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. In a real-life scenario, having 5 avocados and getting 6 more, or having 6 avocados and getting 5 more, both result in 11 avocados <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

## Practice and Mastery

Initially, addition problems may seem daunting, but with consistent practice using methods like drawing circles or number lines, you will eventually memorize these facts and be able to solve them in a fraction of a second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. These fundamental problems in mathematics, like addition and later [[multiplication_as_repeated_addition | multiplication]], require the most practice and memorization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. You will master them quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

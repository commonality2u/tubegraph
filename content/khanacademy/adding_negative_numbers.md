This article provides practice and examples for [[how_to_add_and_subtract_negative_numbers | adding and subtracting negative numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It illustrates the concepts using a number line to help [[visualizing_negative_numbers_on_a_number_line | visualize the operations on a number line]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Basic Subtraction: Positive Minus Larger Positive

Consider the example: `2 - 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.
When [[understanding_subtracting_a_larger_number_from_a_smaller_number | subtracting a larger number from a smaller number]], the result will be a [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negative number]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

To visualize this using a number line:
1.  Start at `2` on the number line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
2.  Subtracting `3` means moving `3` units to the left on the number line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
3.  Moving `1, 2, 3` units to the left from `2` lands on `-1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

> 2 - 3 = -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>

## Subtracting a Positive Number from a Negative Number

Consider the example: `-2 - 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

To visualize this using a number line:
1.  Start at `-2` on the number line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
2.  Subtracting `3` means moving `3` units to the left from `-2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
3.  Moving `1, 2, 3` units to the left from `-2` lands on `-5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

> -2 - 3 = -5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>

In both cases of subtraction, the movement on the number line is to the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Adding a Positive Number to a Negative Number

Consider the example: `-2 + 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

To visualize this using a number line:
1.  Start at `-2` on the number line (2 units to the left of zero) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
2.  Adding `3` means moving `3` units to the right on the number line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
3.  Moving `1, 2, 3` units to the right from `-2` lands on `1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

> -2 + 3 = 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>

## Subtracting a Negative Number

The [[concept_of_subtracting_a_negative_number | concept of subtracting a negative number]] can be confusing, but it follows a specific rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

Consider the example: `2 - (-3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

[!INFO] Key Rule
When you [[subtracting_negative_numbers | subtract a negative number]], it is the same as adding the positive equivalent of that number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

> 2 - (-3) is equivalent to 2 + 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>
> 2 + 3 = 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>

## Subtracting a Negative Number from a Negative Number

Consider the example: `-2 - (-3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
Even with multiple [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negatives]], the rule for [[subtracting_negative_numbers | subtracting a negative]] remains the same: it results in a positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

> -2 - (-3) is the exact same thing as -2 + 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>

As previously seen in the example `-2 + 3`:
1.  Start at `-2` (2 units to the left of 0) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
2.  Adding `3` means moving `3` units to the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
3.  Moving `1, 2, 3` units to the right lands on `1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

> -2 - (-3) = 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>

Cellular respiration is considered a fundamental biochemical reaction, especially for humans, as it is the primary way energy is derived from fuel, predominantly glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Most carbohydrates consumed are eventually converted into glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This process converts glucose into energy and other byproducts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## The Overall Chemical Equation

The overall chemical equation for cellular respiration, demonstrating how glucose is utilized, is:

> C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂ → 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + Energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>

*   **Glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆)**: The chemical formula for glucose consists of six carbons, twelve hydrogens, and six oxygens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. One mole of glucose reacts with six moles of molecular oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Molecular Oxygen (6O₂)**: Oxygen is a necessary reactant for the full process of cellular respiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Carbon Dioxide (6CO₂)**: Six moles of carbon dioxide are produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   **Water (6H₂O)**: Six moles of water are also produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   **Energy**: This is the most crucial product, used for various bodily functions such as doing work, heating the body, and providing electrical impulses in the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## Energy Yield

While cellular respiration produces energy directly, this energy is primarily used to produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. ATP is considered the energy currency for biological systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

The energy output from cellular respiration is distributed as:
*   **Heat**: Some energy is released as heat, which warms the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **ATP**: Textbooks often state that 38 ATP molecules are produced from one mole of glucose under ideal circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. However, in reality, depending on cellular efficiency, the yield is closer to 29 to 30 ATPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

### Stages of Cellular Respiration

Cellular respiration is broken down into constituent parts:

1.  **[[overview_of_glycolysis | Glycolysis]]**
    *   Literally means "breaking up glucose" (glyco- for glucose, -lysis for breaking up) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
    *   It breaks the 6-carbon glucose molecule into two 3-carbon molecules called pyruvate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
    *   [[overall_equation_and_net_energy_yield_of_glycolysis | Glycolysis]] requires 2 ATPs and generates 4 ATPs, resulting in a net gain of 2 ATPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
    *   This stage is **anaerobic**, meaning it does not require oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
    *   Glycolysis also produces NADH, which drives the electron transport chain later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

2.  **Krebs Cycle**
    *   The byproducts of glycolysis are re-engineered and enter the Krebs cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
    *   This cycle generates another 2 ATPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
    *   The Krebs cycle is **aerobic**, requiring oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.
    *   It produces a lot more NADHs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

3.  **Electron Transport Chain**
    *   This process occurs after the Krebs cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
    *   It is responsible for producing the bulk of ATPs, typically 34 ATPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
    *   This stage is also **aerobic**, requiring oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.
    *   The electron transport chain is driven by NADH (from glycolysis and Krebs cycle) and FADH, which are crucial for producing the majority of ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

### Oxygen Requirements

The presence or absence of oxygen dictates the efficiency and pathway of energy production from glucose:
*   **Anaerobic Processes**: [[overview_of_glycolysis | Glycolysis]] does not require oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. If oxygen is scarce, cells can still produce a small amount of energy through glycolysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
*   **Aerobic Processes**: The Krebs cycle and the electron transport chain require oxygen to proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. These stages are responsible for the vast majority of ATP production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

### Fermentation

When oxygen is limited, the byproducts of glycolysis can enter a side process called fermentation instead of the aerobic pathways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
*   **Lactic Acid Fermentation**: In humans and other mammals, muscles produce lactic acid during intense activity when oxygen supply cannot meet demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.
*   **Alcohol Fermentation**: Some organisms, like yeast, produce alcohol through fermentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

The ultimate goal of cellular respiration is to take glucose and repackage its energy into the usable form of ATP, with heat as a byproduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

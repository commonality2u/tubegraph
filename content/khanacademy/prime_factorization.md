Prime factorization is an approach used to break down numbers into their prime components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This method involves decomposing a number into its prime factors and then rebuilding it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

## Application: Finding the [[least_common_multiple_of_denominators | Least Common Multiple]]

One significant application of prime factorization is in determining the [[least_common_multiple_of_denominators | least common multiple (LCM)]] of two or more numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. By finding the prime factorization of each number, one can construct the smallest number that contains all the necessary prime factors of both original numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

### Steps for Finding LCM using Prime Factorization

To find the [[least_common_multiple_of_denominators | LCM]] using prime factorization, follow these steps:
1.  **Find the prime factorization of each number** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
2.  **Construct the LCM** by including enough prime factors to cover all the prime factors present in each of the original numbers, without adding any unnecessary factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### Example: Finding the LCM of 18 and 12

To find the [[least_common_multiple_of_denominators | least common multiple]] of 18 and 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>:

1.  **Prime factorization of 18**:
    *   18 is 2 times 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
    *   9 is 3 times 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
    *   So, the prime factorization of 18 is 2 &times; 3 &times; 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

2.  **Prime factorization of 12**:
    *   12 is 2 times 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
    *   6 is 2 times 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
    *   So, the prime factorization of 12 is 2 &times; 2 &times; 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

3.  **Construct the LCM**:
    *   The [[least_common_multiple_of_denominators | LCM]] must contain all the prime factors of 18 (2 &times; 3 &times; 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
    *   It must also contain all the prime factors of 12 (2 &times; 2 &times; 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
    *   Comparing the factors:
        *   From 18: (2 &times; 3 &times; 3)
        *   From 12: (2 &times; 2 &times; 3)
    *   The [[least_common_multiple_of_denominators | LCM]] needs two 2s (because 12 has two 2s, and 18 only has one) and two 3s (because 18 has two 3s, and 12 only has one) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
    *   Thus, the [[least_common_multiple_of_denominators | LCM]] is 2 &times; 2 &times; 3 &times; 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
    *   Calculating the product: 2 &times; 2 = 4; 4 &times; 3 = 12; 12 &times; 3 = 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
    *   Therefore, the [[least_common_multiple_of_denominators | least common multiple]] of 18 and 12 is 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

### Benefits of Prime Factorization Method

While brute-force listing of multiples can also find the [[least_common_multiple_of_denominators | LCM]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, the prime factorization method is preferred for several reasons:
*   It offers a systematic approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   It is more efficient for larger and more complex numbers, where listing multiples might become tedious and require going very far to find the [[least_common_multiple_of_denominators | LCM]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   It helps in understanding the fundamental composition of numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

Antibiotics are medications specifically designed to kill [[eukaryotes_versus_prokaryotes | bacteria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

## Understanding Bacteria and Infections

Bacteria are defined as living, moving cells that possess metabolisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. Infections can be categorized as either viral or bacterial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. In a bacterial infection, these small cells move around within the body and release toxins that cause illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

## The Problem of Antibiotic Resistance

A responsible doctor will not prescribe antibiotics indiscriminately ("willy-nilly") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. This is because the more antibiotics are used, the higher the likelihood of inadvertently selecting for antibiotic-resistant bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.

### How Resistance Develops

The development of antibiotic resistance is an example of natural selection occurring in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>:
1.  **Variation:** Within any large population of bacteria, there is natural variation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. Some bacteria may have slight, random genetic differences or mutations in their DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. These random changes happen frequently in bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.
2.  **Selection Pressure:** When an antibiotic is introduced, it is highly effective at killing the majority of the common bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.
3.  **Reduced Competition:** The rare, randomly occurring bacteria that happen to be resistant to the antibiotic are not killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. With their competitors eliminated, these resistant bacteria now have the entire "ecosystem" to themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.
4.  **Replication and Dominance:** These resistant bacteria can then replicate rapidly and become the dominant strain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. This process is not a result of "design" or "intelligent process" by the bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>; it is simply random change and the environment (in this case, the antibiotic) selecting for that random change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.
5.  **Ineffective Treatment:** As a result, the antibiotic that was carefully developed to destroy the original bacterial strain becomes useless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>.

### Superbugs

The term "superbug" refers to a bacterial strain that has become resistant to antibiotics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. These "superbugs" do not design themselves to be resistant; rather, human actions, by killing off their competition, allow them to proliferate and take over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. Continuous heavy use of antibiotics will always select for bacteria that are unaffected by the antibiotics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.

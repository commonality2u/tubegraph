## What are Irrational Numbers?
While a [[definition_of_rational_numbers | rational number]] is any number that can be represented as the ratio of two integers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, [[introduction_to_irrational_numbers | irrational numbers]] are numbers that cannot be represented in this way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Some of the most famous numbers in mathematics are [[introduction_to_irrational_numbers | irrational numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### Distinguishing from Rational Numbers
*   **Integers**: Any integer is a [[definition_of_rational_numbers | rational number]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. For example, 1 can be represented as 1/1, -2/-2, or 10,000/10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The number -7 can be represented as -7/1, 7/-1, or -14/2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   **Decimals**: Numbers like 3.75 can be written as 375/100 or 15/4, making them [[definition_of_rational_numbers | rational numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   [[repeating_decimals_as_rational_numbers | Repeating decimals]]: Any [[repeating_decimals_as_rational_numbers | repeating decimal]], such as 0.333... (0.3 repeating), can be represented as the ratio of two integers (e.g., 1/3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Even decimals with many repeating digits can be expressed as a ratio of two integers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

## Examples of Famous Irrational Numbers
Several well-known numbers are classified as [[introduction_to_irrational_numbers | irrational numbers]]:

*   **Pi (π)**: This number represents the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Pi never terminates and never repeats in its decimal representation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **e**: Often associated with continuously compounding interest and complex analysis, 'e' also never terminates and never repeats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   **Square root of 2 (√2)**: The square root of 2 is an [[introduction_to_irrational_numbers | irrational number]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   **Phi (Φ)**: Also known as the golden ratio, Phi is another [[introduction_to_irrational_numbers | irrational number]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

Many numbers that "pop out of nature" are [[introduction_to_irrational_numbers | irrational numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Properties and Prevalence of Irrational Numbers
Despite seeming "exotic," [[introduction_to_irrational_numbers | irrational numbers]] are not uncommon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

*   **Density**: There is always at least one [[introduction_to_irrational_numbers | irrational number]] between any two [[definition_of_rational_numbers | rational numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. In fact, there is an infinite number of [[introduction_to_irrational_numbers | irrational numbers]] between any two [[definition_of_rational_numbers | rational numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   **Square Roots**: Taking the [[square_roots_and_perfect_squares | square root]] of any non-[[square_roots_and_perfect_squares | perfect square]] will result in an [[introduction_to_irrational_numbers | irrational number]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   **Operations**:
    *   The sum of an [[introduction_to_irrational_numbers | irrational number]] and a [[definition_of_rational_numbers | rational number]] is always [[introduction_to_irrational_numbers | irrational]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
    *   The product of an [[introduction_to_irrational_numbers | irrational number]] and a [[definition_of_rational_numbers | rational number]] is also always [[introduction_to_irrational_numbers | irrational]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

These properties demonstrate that there are a great many [[introduction_to_irrational_numbers | irrational numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

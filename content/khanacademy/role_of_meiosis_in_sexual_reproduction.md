Meiosis is a detailed cell division process used to produce gametes, which are essential for sexual reproduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. Unlike [[comparison_of_mitosis_and_meiosis | mitosis]], which results in two diploid cells that are duplicates of the original <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, meiosis involves two rounds of division and results in four haploid cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. This process occurs specifically in germ cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

## Interphase

Before meiosis begins, a germ cell spends most of its time in interphase, a period of normal cell living and transcription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. During the S phase of interphase, the cell's DNA replicates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. Homologous pairs of chromosomes (one from each parent) replicate, with each chromosome forming two sister chromatids connected by a centromere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>. Additionally, the centrosomes, which are involved in forming the microtubule structure, also duplicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>. During interphase, chromosomes exist in an unwound state called chromatin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

## Meiosis I

Meiosis I is the first round of cell division in meiosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.

### [[phases_of_meiosis | Prophase I]]

In [[phases_of_meiosis | Prophase I]], several key events occur:
*   The nuclear envelope begins to disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>.
*   Centrosomes move apart and start developing spindle fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>.
*   The chromatin condenses and forms visible chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>.
*   A crucial step unique to meiosis I is that homologous chromosome pairs line up next to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>.
*   [[genetic_variation_through_crossing_over | Genetic Variation through Crossing Over]]: These homologous pairs can undergo genetic recombination, also known as [[genetic_variation_through_crossing_over | crossing over]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>. In this process, homologous points on the chromosomes exchange segments, resulting in chromosomes that are a mixture of maternal and paternal genetic material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>. This process is highly organized and creates significant variation in a population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>.

### [[phases_of_meiosis | Metaphase I]]

During [[phases_of_meiosis | Metaphase I]], the nuclear envelope is completely gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>. The centrosomes are at opposite sides of the cell, and spindle fibers attach to the kinetochores on the centromeres of the chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09:00">[13:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:46:00">[14:46:00]</a>. The homologous chromosome pairs align along the metaphase plate (the center of the cell) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a>. The orientation of each homologous pair is random, further contributing to genetic variation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:00">[14:15:00]</a>.

### [[phases_of_meiosis | Anaphase I]]

In [[phases_of_meiosis | Anaphase I]], the homologous chromosome pairs separate and are pulled to opposite poles of the cell by the spindle fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22:00">[15:22:00]</a>. A key [[differences_between_mitosis_and_meiosis | difference from mitosis]] is that the sister chromatids *do not* separate during Anaphase I; they remain attached at their centromeres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:13:00">[15:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:00">[16:03:00]</a>.

### [[phases_of_meiosis | Telophase I]]

During [[phases_of_meiosis | Telophase I]]:
*   The separated homologous chromosomes arrive at their respective ends of the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:00">[16:51:00]</a>.
*   Microtubules begin to disassemble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:15:00">[17:15:00]</a>.
*   Cytokinesis (division of the cytoplasm) occurs, and the cell elongates and begins to cleave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:29:00">[17:29:00]</a>.
*   The nuclear envelope reforms around the chromosomes at each pole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:42:00">[17:42:00]</a>.
*   The result is two haploid cells, each containing half the number of chromosomes as the original diploid cell, but each chromosome still consists of two sister chromatids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:09:00">[18:09:00]</a>. This reduction in chromosome number is a primary outcome of [[process and phases of meiosis | meiosis]].

## Meiosis II

Meiosis II is the second round of cell division, which is very similar to [[comparison of mitosis and meiosis | mitosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:26:00">[18:26:00]</a>. Sometimes, a brief interphase II occurs where centrosomes duplicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:32:00">[18:32:00]</a>.

### [[phases_of_meiosis | Prophase II]]

In [[phases_of_meiosis | Prophase II]]:
*   The nuclear envelope, which formed in Telophase I, disintegrates again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:53:00">[19:53:00]</a>.
*   Centrosomes move apart to opposite poles of each cell, generating spindle fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:10:00">[20:10:00]</a>.

### [[phases_of_meiosis | Metaphase II]]

During [[phases_of_meiosis | Metaphase II]], the chromosomes in each of the two haploid cells align individually along the metaphase plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:42:00">[20:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:29:00">[21:29:00]</a>. Spindle fibers attach to the kinetochores on the centromeres of the sister chromatids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:58:00">[21:58:00]</a>.

### [[phases_of_meiosis | Anaphase II]]

In [[phases_of_meiosis | Anaphase II]], the sister chromatids finally separate and are pulled to opposite poles of the cell by the kinetochore microtubules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:24:00">[22:24:00]</a>. This separation is analogous to what happens in [[detailed_cell_division_process_in_meiosis | anaphase of mitosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:51:00">[22:51:00]</a>. Once separated, each chromatid is now considered a full chromosome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:43:00">[23:43:00]</a>.

### [[phases_of_meiosis | Telophase II]]

During [[phases_of_meiosis | Telophase II]]:
*   The chromosomes arrive at the poles, and the cell elongates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:51:00">[24:51:00]</a>.
*   Cytokinesis occurs, resulting in the division of the cytoplasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:11:00">[25:11:00]</a>.
*   Nuclear envelopes reform around the sets of chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:15:00">[25:15:00]</a>.
*   The final outcome of meiosis is four haploid cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>, each with a unique combination of genetic material due to [[genetic_variation_through_crossing_over | crossing over]] and random assortment of homologous chromosomes in Meiosis I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:56:00">[26:56:00]</a>. These haploid cells are called gametes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:11:00">[27:11:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

The [[role_of_mitosis_and_meiosis_in_human_development_and_reproduction | role of meiosis in sexual reproduction]] is to produce genetically diverse haploid gametes from a diploid germ cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. The two stages of division—Meiosis I, which separates homologous pairs, and Meiosis II, which separates sister chromatids—ensure the reduction in chromosome number and the introduction of genetic variation, which is crucial for the adaptability and evolution of species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:52:00">[26:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:01:00">[27:01:00]</a>.

[[overview_of_meiosis|Meiosis]] is a specialized cell division process that occurs in germ cells to produce [[role_of_gametes_in_sexual_reproduction|gametes]] (sperm or egg cells) for [[role_of_gametes_in_sexual_reproduction|sexual reproduction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Unlike [[overview_of_mitosis|mitosis]], which results in two identical diploid cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, meiosis produces four haploid cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, each with half the number of chromosomes of the parent cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. This reduction in chromosome number is essential for maintaining the correct chromosome count across generations during [[role_of_gametes_in_sexual_reproduction|sexual reproduction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Comparison to Mitosis
[[differences_between_mitosis_and_meiosis|Mitosis]] is the process by which most somatic cells replicate, such as skin or hair cells, essentially duplicating themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. It typically starts with a diploid cell and ends with two diploid cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The formal definition of [[overview_of_mitosis|mitosis]] is the duplication of the [[dna_in_cells_and_the_role_of_nucleus|nucleus]], which usually leads to two complete cells through cytokinesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

In contrast, [[overview_of_meiosis|meiosis]] involves two rounds of division, [[stages_and_process_of_meiosis|Meiosis I]] and [[stages_and_process_of_meiosis|Meiosis II]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, starting with a diploid germ cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a> and ultimately yielding four haploid cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Stages of Meiosis
Before [[stages_and_process_of_meiosis|meiosis]] begins, the cell undergoes **interphase**, a period where the cell lives and performs its normal functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. During the S phase of interphase, the [[dna_structure_and_its_role_in_heredity|DNA]] replicates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, meaning each chromosome, including homologous pairs, duplicates to form two sister chromatids joined by a centromere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Centrosomes also replicate during this phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

Meiosis is divided into two main stages:

### Meiosis I
[[stages_and_process_of_meiosis|Meiosis I]] is the first division, where homologous chromosomes separate, resulting in two haploid cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Each of these cells still contains duplicated chromosomes (sister chromatids). The [[stages_and_process_of_meiosis|phases of meiosis I]] include:

*   **Prophase I**:
    *   The [[dna_in_cells_and_the_role_of_nucleus|nuclear envelope]] begins to disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
    *   Chromatin condenses and coils into visible chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
    *   Crucially, homologous chromosomes pair up and align closely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
    *   **[[genetic_variation_through_meiotic_processes|Crossing over]] (genetic recombination)** occurs between non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. This exchange of genetic material leads to [[genetic_variation_through_meiotic_processes|genetic variation]] in the resulting [[role_of_gametes_in_sexual_reproduction|gametes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
    *   Centrosomes move to opposite poles and begin forming spindle fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   **Metaphase I**: Homologous pairs align at the metaphase plate (the center of the cell) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. The orientation of each homologous pair is random, further contributing to [[genetic_variation_through_meiotic_processes|genetic variation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. Spindle fibers attach to the kinetochores on the centromeres of each homologous chromosome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.
*   **Anaphase I**: Homologous chromosomes separate and are pulled to opposite poles of the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. Sister chromatids remain attached at their centromeres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.
*   **Telophase I**: Chromosomes arrive at the poles, the [[dna_in_cells_and_the_role_of_nucleus|nuclear envelope]] may reform (though it's often temporary) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. Cytokinesis occurs, dividing the cytoplasm and forming two haploid daughter cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>. Each daughter cell now contains a haploid set of chromosomes, but each chromosome still consists of two sister chromatids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>.

### Meiosis II
[[stages_and_process_of_meiosis|Meiosis II]] is analogous to [[overview_of_mitosis|mitosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, where sister chromatids separate. Each of the two cells produced in Meiosis I enters [[stages_and_process_of_meiosis|Meiosis II]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>. The [[stages_and_process_of_meiosis|phases of meiosis II]] include:

*   **Prophase II**:
    *   The [[dna_in_cells_and_the_role_of_nucleus|nuclear envelope]] (if it reformed) disintegrates again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.
    *   Centrosomes move to opposite poles and begin forming new spindle fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.
*   **Metaphase II**: Chromosomes (each still composed of two sister chromatids) align individually at the metaphase plate in each of the two cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>. Spindle fibers attach to the kinetochores on both sides of the centromere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>.
*   **Anaphase II**: Sister chromatids finally separate and are pulled to opposite poles of the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>. Once separated, they are considered individual chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>.
*   **Telophase II**: Chromosomes arrive at the poles, the [[dna_in_cells_and_the_role_of_nucleus|nuclear envelope]] reforms around each set of chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>. Cytokinesis occurs, resulting in a total of four unique haploid cells, each containing unduplicated chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>.

## Outcome and Significance for Sexual Reproduction
The end result of [[overview_of_meiosis|meiosis]] is four haploid [[role_of_gametes_in_sexual_reproduction|gametes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>. Each of these cells contains a unique combination of genetic material due to:
1.  **[[genetic_variation_through_meiotic_processes|Crossing over]]** during Prophase I, which shuffles alleles between homologous chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.
2.  **Independent assortment** of homologous chromosomes during Metaphase I, where the random alignment of homologous pairs determines which chromosome goes to which daughter cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

This process ensures that each [[role_of_gametes_in_sexual_reproduction|gamete]] is genetically distinct, introducing significant [[genetic_variation_through_meiotic_processes|variation]] into a population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>. When two [[role_of_gametes_in_sexual_reproduction|gametes]] (sperm and egg) fuse during fertilization, the diploid chromosome number is restored, but with a novel combination of genetic traits from both parents, driving evolution and adaptation.

> [!NOTE] Centromere vs. Centrosome
> It's important to distinguish between **centromeres** and **centrosomes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>.
> *   **Centromeres** are the constricted regions on chromosomes that connect two sister chromatids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. Kinetochores, protein structures where spindle fibers attach, are found on centromeres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.
> *   **Centrosomes** are organelles that serve as the main microtubule-organizing centers, generating spindle fibers that pull chromosomes apart during cell division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

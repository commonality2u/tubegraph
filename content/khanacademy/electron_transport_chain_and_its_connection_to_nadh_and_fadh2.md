The [[electron_transport_chain_and_its_connection_to_nadh_and_fadh2 | electron transport chain]] (ETC) is a crucial stage in [[cellular_respiration_process | cellular respiration]] where the majority of ATP is produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. This process relies heavily on the electron carrier molecules, NADH and FADH2, which are generated in earlier stages of [[cellular_respiration_process | cellular respiration]].

## Production of NADH and FADH2

NADH and FADH2 are produced during the initial stages of glucose breakdown:

*   **Glycolysis**
    *   [[steps_and_reactions_in_glycolysis | Glycolysis]], the process of splitting a glucose molecule into two pyruvic acids (or pyruvates), yields a net payoff of two ATPs and two NADHs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   **Pyruvate Oxidation**
    *   Before entering the [[enzymecatalyzed_reactions_in_the_krebs_cycle | Krebs cycle]], each pyruvate undergoes oxidation, where one carbon is cleaved off, forming a 2-carbon compound called acetyl-CoA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. This step also reduces one NAD+ to NADH per pyruvate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Since two pyruvates are produced from one glucose molecule, this preparatory stage yields two NADHs in total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
*   **The Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle)**
    *   The [[enzymecatalyzed_reactions_in_the_krebs_cycle | Krebs cycle]] formally begins when acetyl-CoA merges with a 4-carbon molecule called oxaloacetic acid to form citrate (citric acid), a 6-carbon molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
    *   During the oxidation of citric acid back to oxaloacetic acid, two carbons are cleaved off and released as CO2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
    *   For each turn of the [[enzymecatalyzed_reactions_in_the_krebs_cycle | Krebs cycle]], three NADHs, one FADH2, and one ATP are produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
    *   Since the cycle occurs twice for every glucose molecule (once for each pyruvate), it yields a total of six NADHs, two FADH2s, and two ATPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.

## Total NADH and FADH2 per Glucose Molecule

From one molecule of glucose, the total electron carriers generated are:
*   **10 NADHs**:
    *   Two from [[steps_and_reactions_in_glycolysis | glycolysis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
    *   Two from pyruvate oxidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
    *   Six from the [[enzymecatalyzed_reactions_in_the_krebs_cycle | Krebs cycle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
*   **2 FADH2s**:
    *   Two from the [[enzymecatalyzed_reactions_in_the_krebs_cycle | Krebs cycle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

## Role of NADH and FADH2 in the Electron Transport Chain

NADH and FADH2 are the primary inputs into the [[electron_transport_chain_and_its_connection_to_nadh_and_fadh2 | electron transport chain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. In the ETC, these molecules are oxidized, meaning they lose their hydrogens (and associated electrons) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. This process powers the generation of a large amount of ATP.

### ATP Yield from Electron Carriers

*   Each NADH molecule, when oxidized in the [[electron_transport_chain_and_its_connection_to_nadh_and_fadh2 | electron transport chain]], produces three ATPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. Therefore, 10 NADHs yield 30 ATPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
*   Each FADH2 molecule, when oxidized, produces two ATPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. Therefore, 2 FADH2s yield 4 ATPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

### Total ATP Yield from Glucose

When combined with the directly produced ATPs from glycolysis (2 ATPs) and the [[enzymecatalyzed_reactions_in_the_krebs_cycle | Krebs cycle]] (2 ATPs), the energy from the electron transport chain results in a theoretical maximum of 38 ATPs per glucose molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. This total includes:
*   4 ATPs directly from [[steps_and_reactions_in_glycolysis | glycolysis]] and the [[enzymecatalyzed_reactions_in_the_krebs_cycle | Krebs cycle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.
*   34 ATPs from the [[electron_transport_chain_and_its_connection_to_nadh_and_fadh2 | electron transport chain]] (30 from NADH, 4 from FADH2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

While this represents a theoretical maximum, actual ATP yield in cells can be slightly lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.

The classification of cells into eukaryotes and prokaryotes represents a fundamental division in the living world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. This distinction is primarily based on the presence or absence of a nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Defining Characteristics

### Cellular Membrane
All cells, regardless of whether they are eukaryotic or prokaryotic, possess a [[cellular_membrane_structure | cellular membrane]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This membrane serves to separate the cell from its external environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, effectively defining it as a distinct, small compartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

### DNA
Every cell contains [[dna_and_cell_function | DNA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, which dictates the characteristics of a living organism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Eukaryotes

### Presence of a Nucleus
Eukaryotic cells are characterized by the presence of a nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This nucleus is a membrane-bound structure that encloses the cell's [[dna_and_cell_function | DNA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, separating it from the rest of the cell's contents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

### Complexity and Size
Eukaryotes generally tend to be larger and more complex than prokaryotes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

### Examples
Common examples of eukaryotic organisms include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>:
*   Plants
*   Animals
*   Fungi

### Organelles
Eukaryotic cells contain various membrane-bound organelles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>, which are specialized subunits within the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. These include:
*   **Nucleus**: Houses the [[dna_and_cell_function | DNA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   **Nucleolus**: A dense region within the nucleus where ribosomal RNA is produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. It is not membrane-bound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **Ribosomes**: Sites of [[protein_synthesis_and_ribosomes | protein synthesis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. These can be free-floating in the cytosol or attached to the endoplasmic reticulum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
*   **Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)**: A network of tunnels and folded membranes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
    *   **Rough ER**: Has ribosomes attached, where proteins destined for membranes or outside the cell are synthesized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
    *   **Smooth ER**: Lacks ribosomes and has other functions, such as hormone and fatty compound production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
*   **Golgi Bodies**: Process and package proteins from the ER for secretion or delivery to other organelles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
*   **Vesicles**: Small, membrane-bound sacs that transport proteins and other substances within or out of the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.
*   **Lysosomes**: Found in animal cells, they contain enzymes that dissolve and digest cellular waste and foreign materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.
*   **Vacuoles**: General term for large, membrane-bound organelles that store substances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. Lytic vacuoles in plants serve a similar function to lysosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>.
*   **Mitochondria**: Responsible for cellular respiration, converting sugars into ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. They possess their own [[dna_and_cell_function | DNA]] and can reproduce independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>, suggesting they may have evolved from independent prokaryotes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.
*   **Chloroplasts**: Found in plant cells, these organelles are the sites of photosynthesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>. Like mitochondria, they have their own [[dna_and_cell_function | DNA]] and ribosomes, suggesting an endosymbiotic origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.
*   **Cell Wall**: Present in plant cells and non-animal cells, providing rigidity and structure outside the [[cellular_membrane_structure | cellular membrane]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. In plants, it is made of cellulose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>.
*   **Microfilaments/Actin Filaments**: Provide the cell's three-dimensional structure and facilitate movement within the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.
*   **Centrioles**: Involved in cell division ([[differences_between_mitosis_and_meiosis | mitosis]] and [[comparison_of_mitosis_and_meiosis | meiosis]]), coordinating microtubules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>. Two centrioles at right angles form a centrosome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>.

## Prokaryotes

### Absence of a Nucleus
Prokaryotic cells are defined by the *absence* of a nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Their [[dna_and_cell_function | DNA]] is not enclosed within a membrane-bound compartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### Examples
The two main groups of prokaryotes are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>:
*   Bacteria
*   Archaea

### Archaea
Archaea were initially thought to be a type of bacteria but are now recognized as a distinct and separate group of organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Evolutionary Perspective
From an evolutionary standpoint, the classification of organisms into three primary domains is considered more accurate: Eukaryotes, Bacteria, and Archaea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. This suggests that the prokaryote/eukaryote division is a descriptive grouping based on structural features rather than a direct evolutionary lineage in all cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

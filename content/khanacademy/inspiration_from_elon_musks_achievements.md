From: [[khanacademy]] <br/> 

Sal Khan, founder of Khan Academy, has expressed profound inspiration drawn from [[Elon Musks ventures into electric vehicles space exploration and internet companies | Elon Musk's achievements]] and his approach to tackling monumental challenges. This inspiration reinforces Khan Academy's own ambitious goals for global education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## A Source of Encouragement

Khan recounts interviewing [[Elon Musks ventures into electric vehicles space exploration and internet companies | Elon Musk]] in 2013, noting that almost everything Musk stated he would do — including very large statements — has either been accomplished or is very close to completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. This provides Khan with incredible inspiration, particularly when questioning if Khan Academy's mission to educate all of humanity is "too big" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

Khan emphasizes that just as society should not shy away from challenges like solving climate change, improving transportation, or colonizing other planets, it should not shy away from educating the entire planet, and even beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. This perspective is bolstered by [[Elon Musks ventures into electric vehicles space exploration and internet companies | Musk's demonstrated ability]] to achieve seemingly impossible feats, such as those related to [[Teslas mission and impact on the automotive industry | Tesla]] and [[Initial struggles and successes with SpaceX and its impact on space industry | SpaceX]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

> "Any time that I question even myself and I say is this mission too big to actually try to educate all of humanity, I think of the incredible work that you've done... I take incredible inspiration that it is not too big of a mission." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>

## Supporting Future Potential

The [[Elon Musk donation to Khan Academy | Musk Foundation's $5 million donation]] to Khan Academy is seen as foundational to building a multi-generational institution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The ultimate goal is to ensure that future [[Elon Musks ventures into electric vehicles space exploration and internet companies | Elon Musks]] worldwide are also able to tap into their full [[Confidence in learning potential | potential]] and contribute to the "up leveling" of human civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This aligns with Khan Academy's [[Global reach and goals of Khan Academy | aspiration to serve the globe]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

Despite the significant [[Impact of donations on Khan Academys programs | impact of such donations]], Khan Academy continues to operate at a deficit and relies on support from individuals and organizations to achieve its global educational mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Its annual budget is one one-hundred-thousandth of the world's $5 trillion annual expenditure on education, comparable to that of a large high school, yet it aims to serve the entire planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

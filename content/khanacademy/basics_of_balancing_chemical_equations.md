[[balancing_chemical_equations | Balancing chemical equations]] is a fundamental concept taught in first-year chemistry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While often challenging for students, it is a straightforward concept that requires a bit of an "art" to master <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## What is a Chemical Equation?

A [[definition_and_purpose_of_chemical_equations | chemical equation]] serves to describe a chemical reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. It typically shows:
*   **Reactants**: The substances that undergo the reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   **Products**: The substances formed as a result of the reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

For example, the reaction of aluminum with oxygen gas to produce aluminum oxide is represented as:
`Al + O₂ → Al₂O₃` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>

## Why Balance Chemical Equations?

The initial representation of a chemical reaction might not reflect the [[conservation_of_mass_in_chemical_reactions | conservation of mass]] principle, which states that atoms are neither created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. In the example above:
*   On the reactant side: 1 atom of aluminum, 2 atoms of oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   On the product side: 2 atoms of aluminum, 3 atoms of oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

Since the number of aluminum and oxygen atoms differs on each side of the equation, it is unbalanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. [[balancing_chemical_equations | Balancing equations]] involves adjusting the coefficients (numbers in front of the chemical formulas) to ensure the same number of each type of atom is present on both the reactant and product sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

It is crucial to remember that you **cannot** change the subscripts within a chemical formula (e.g., changing O₂ to O₃), as this would alter the identity of the molecule itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. You can only change the number of whole molecules present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## [[steps_to_balance_a_chemical_equation | Methods to Solve Balancing Equations]]

### Example 1: Aluminum and Oxygen
Let's balance the reaction: `Al + O₂ → Al₂O₃` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>

1.  **Balance Aluminum (Al)**:
    *   Reactants: 1 Al <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
    *   Products: 2 Al <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>
    *   Place a '2' in front of Al on the reactant side: `2Al + O₂ → Al₂O₃` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Now, there are 2 Al atoms on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

2.  **Balance Oxygen (O)**:
    *   Reactants: 2 O <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>
    *   Products: 3 O <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>
    *   To get 3 oxygens on the reactant side, multiply O₂ by 1.5: `2Al + 1.5O₂ → Al₂O₃` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
    *   Now, there are 3 O atoms on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

3.  **Eliminate Fractions**:
    *   You cannot have half an atom or molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Multiply all coefficients in the entire equation by the smallest whole number that eliminates the fraction. In this case, multiply by '2':
    *   `2 * (2Al + 1.5O₂ → Al₂O₃)` yields `4Al + 3O₂ → 2Al₂O₃` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

The final balanced equation has:
*   Aluminum: 4 on left, 2 * 2 = 4 on right.
*   Oxygen: 3 * 2 = 6 on left, 2 * 3 = 6 on right.

### Example 2: Methane Combustion
Balance: `C₂H₄(g) + O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + H₂O(l)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>

**General Strategy**: Balance complicated molecules first, then single atom molecules (like O₂) last, as they are easier to adjust without affecting other atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

1.  **Balance Carbon (C)**:
    *   Reactants: 2 C in C₂H₄ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>
    *   Products: 1 C in CO₂ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>
    *   Place a '2' in front of CO₂: `C₂H₄ + O₂ → 2CO₂ + H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Carbons are now balanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

2.  **Balance Hydrogen (H)**:
    *   Reactants: 4 H in C₂H₄ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>
    *   Products: 2 H in H₂O <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>
    *   Place a '2' in front of H₂O: `C₂H₄ + O₂ → 2CO₂ + 2H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Hydrogens are now balanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

3.  **Balance Oxygen (O)** (Last, as O₂ is a single element molecule):
    *   Reactants: 2 O in O₂ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>
    *   Products: (2 * 2) = 4 O from 2CO₂ and (2 * 1) = 2 O from 2H₂O. Total = 6 O <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
    *   To get 6 oxygens on the reactant side, place a '3' in front of O₂: `C₂H₄ + 3O₂ → 2CO₂ + 2H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

The final balanced equation:
*   Carbon: 2 on left, 2 on right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   Hydrogen: 4 on left, 2 * 2 = 4 on right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   Oxygen: 3 * 2 = 6 on left, (2 * 2) + (2 * 1) = 4 + 2 = 6 on right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

### Example 3: Ethane Combustion (Another Fractional Coefficient)
Balance: `C₂H₆ + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>

1.  **Balance Carbon (C)**:
    *   Reactants: 2 C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>
    *   Products: 1 C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>
    *   Place a '2' in front of CO₂: `C₂H₆ + O₂ → 2CO₂ + H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

2.  **Balance Hydrogen (H)**:
    *   Reactants: 6 H <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>
    *   Products: 2 H in H₂O <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>
    *   Place a '3' in front of H₂O: `C₂H₆ + O₂ → 2CO₂ + 3H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. Hydrogens are now balanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

3.  **Balance Oxygen (O)**:
    *   Reactants: 2 O in O₂ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>
    *   Products: (2 * 2) = 4 O from 2CO₂ and (3 * 1) = 3 O from 3H₂O. Total = 7 O <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
    *   To get 7 oxygens on the reactant side, place '3.5' in front of O₂: `C₂H₆ + 3.5O₂ → 2CO₂ + 3H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

4.  **Eliminate Fractions**:
    *   Multiply all coefficients by '2' to eliminate the 3.5:
    *   `2 * (C₂H₆ + 3.5O₂ → 2CO₂ + 3H₂O)` yields `2C₂H₆ + 7O₂ → 4CO₂ + 6H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

Check the final balanced equation:
*   Carbon: 2 * 2 = 4 on left, 4 on right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   Hydrogen: 2 * 6 = 12 on left, 6 * 2 = 12 on right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
*   Oxygen: 7 * 2 = 14 on left, (4 * 2) + (6 * 1) = 8 + 6 = 14 on right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

### Example 4: Iron Oxide and Sulfuric Acid (Polyatomic Ions)
Balance: `Fe₂O₃ + H₂SO₄ → Fe₂(SO₄)₃ + H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>

**Special Tip**: If a polyatomic ion (like SO₄) remains intact on both sides of the equation, treat it as a single unit or "pseudo-atom" for balancing purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. Let's substitute SO₄ with 'X' to simplify: `Fe₂O₃ + H₂X → Fe₂X₃ + H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

1.  **Balance Iron (Fe)**:
    *   Reactants: 2 Fe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>
    *   Products: 2 Fe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>
    *   Iron is already balanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.

2.  **Balance the "X" (Sulfate, SO₄) group**:
    *   Reactants: 1 X <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>
    *   Products: 3 X <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>
    *   Place a '3' in front of H₂X: `Fe₂O₃ + 3H₂X → Fe₂X₃ + H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. "X" is now balanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.

3.  **Balance Oxygen (O)** (only those not part of the X group):
    *   Reactants: 3 O in Fe₂O₃ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>
    *   Products: 1 O in H₂O <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>
    *   Place a '3' in front of H₂O: `Fe₂O₃ + 3H₂X → Fe₂X₃ + 3H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. Oxygens are now balanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

4.  **Balance Hydrogen (H)**:
    *   Reactants: 3 * 2 = 6 H in 3H₂X <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>
    *   Products: 3 * 2 = 6 H in 3H₂O <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>
    *   Hydrogens are already balanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

Substitute 'SO₄' back for 'X': `Fe₂O₃ + 3H₂SO₄ → Fe₂(SO₄)₃ + 3H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

The equation is balanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

### Example 5: Carbon Dioxide and Hydrogen Gas
Balance: `CO₂ + H₂ → CH₄ + H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>

1.  **Balance Carbon (C)**:
    *   Reactants: 1 C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>
    *   Products: 1 C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>
    *   Carbon is balanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

2.  **Balance Oxygen (O)**:
    *   Reactants: 2 O in CO₂ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>
    *   Products: 1 O in H₂O <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>
    *   Place a '2' in front of H₂O: `CO₂ + H₂ → CH₄ + 2H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.

3.  **Balance Hydrogen (H)** (Last, as H₂ is a single element molecule):
    *   Reactants: 2 H in H₂ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>
    *   Products: 4 H in CH₄ + (2 * 2) = 4 H in 2H₂O. Total = 8 H <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.
    *   To get 8 hydrogens on the reactant side, place a '4' in front of H₂: `CO₂ + 4H₂ → CH₄ + 2H₂O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

The equation is now balanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.

By following these [[steps_to_balance_a_chemical_equation | steps to balance a chemical equation]] and practicing with various [[examples_of_balancing_different_types_of_equations | types of equations]], the process can become quite enjoyable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Remember to focus on more complex molecules first and save the single-element molecules for last <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. If fractions appear, multiply the entire equation by a whole number to resolve them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

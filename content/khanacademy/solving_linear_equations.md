This article explores how to [[systematic_approach_to_solving_equations | systematically approach solving equations]] that involve more than one operation, building upon simpler [[understanding_linear_equations | linear equations]] previously discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The key is to isolate the variable term before finally solving for the variable itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Example 1: `3x + 5 = 17`

This equation differs from simpler forms like `3x = 17` due to the addition of `+5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

### Conceptual Understanding

To understand the equation `3x + 5 = 17` tangibly, imagine `3x` as three individual 'x' objects (`x + x + x`) and `+5` as five individual unit objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This entire collection on the left side is equal to seventeen unit objects on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

To maintain equality, any operation performed on one side of the equation must also be performed on the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. If five objects are removed from the left side, five objects must also be removed from the right side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

### Solving with Operations

1.  **Isolate the variable term:** The goal is to eliminate the `+5` from the left side to get `3x` alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
    *   Subtract `5` from both sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
        ```
        3x + 5 - 5 = 17 - 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>
        ```
    *   On the left side, `+5` and `-5` cancel out, leaving `3x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
    *   On the right side, `17 - 5` equals `12` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
        ```
        3x = 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>
        ```

2.  **Solve for `x`:** Now the equation is in a simpler form, similar to those solved using basic [[solving_linear_equations_using_division_and_multiplication | division and multiplication]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
    *   Divide both sides of the equation by `3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
        ```
        3x / 3 = 12 / 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>
        ```
    *   On the left side, the `3`s cancel out, leaving `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
    *   On the right side, `12 / 3` equals `4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
        ```
        x = 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>
        ```

## Example 2: `7x - 2 = -10`

This example introduces negative numbers, but the [[using_algebraic_steps_to_solve_equations | algebraic steps]] remain the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

1.  **Isolate the variable term:** The goal is to eliminate the `-2` from the left side to get `7x` alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
    *   Add `2` to both sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
        ```
        7x - 2 + 2 = -10 + 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>
        ```
    *   On the left side, `-2` and `+2` cancel out, leaving `7x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
    *   On the right side, `-10 + 2` equals `-8` (moving two units to the right on a number line from `-10`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
        ```
        7x = -8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>
        ```

2.  **Solve for `x`:**
    *   Divide both sides of the equation by `7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.
        ```
        7x / 7 = -8 / 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>
        ```
    *   On the left side, the `7`s cancel out, leaving `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
    *   On the right side, the result is `-8/7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. This can also be expressed as a mixed number: `-1 and 1/7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
        ```
        x = -8/7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>
        ```

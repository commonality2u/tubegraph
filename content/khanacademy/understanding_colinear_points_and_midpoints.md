Geometry, derived from "geo" (earth) and "metry" (measurement), is the study of how shapes and space relate to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. It encapsulates everything from [[line_segments_rays_and_lines_in_geometry | lines]] and triangles to patterns and three-dimensional shapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Fundamental Concepts

### Points
A [[understanding_points_and_their_properties | point]] is a basic starting block in geometry, represented as a dot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. It signifies a specific position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   **Property**: A [[understanding_points_and_their_properties | point]] has zero dimensions, meaning you cannot move in any direction while remaining on that [[understanding_points_and_their_properties | point]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   **Labeling**: [[understanding_points_and_their_properties | Points]] are typically labeled with capital letters, such as [[understanding_points_and_their_properties | point]] A or [[understanding_points_and_their_properties | point]] B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### Line Segments
A [[line_segments_rays_and_lines_in_geometry | line segment]] consists of all [[understanding_points_and_their_properties | points]] that connect two distinct [[understanding_points_and_their_properties | points]] (known as endpoints) along a straight path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **Endpoints**: The starting and ending [[understanding_points_and_their_properties | points]] of a [[line_segments_rays_and_lines_in_geometry | line segment]] are called its endpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **Labeling**: A [[line_segments_rays_and_lines_in_geometry | line segment]] is labeled using its two endpoints with a line drawn above them (e.g., AB with a line over it) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. The order of letters does not matter (AB is the same as BA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   **Length**: The length or distance of a [[line_segments_rays_and_lines_in_geometry | line segment]] is denoted by writing the endpoints without the line above (e.g., AB = 5 units) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
*   **Dimension**: A [[line_segments_rays_and_lines_in_geometry | line segment]] is a one-dimensional object, meaning movement is only possible along its length (back and forth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. It has no width <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

### Rays
A [[line_segments_rays_and_lines_in_geometry | ray]] starts at one [[understanding_points_and_their_properties | point]] (called the vertex) and extends infinitely in one direction through another [[understanding_points_and_their_properties | point]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
*   **Labeling**: A [[line_segments_rays_and_lines_in_geometry | ray]] is labeled by its vertex first, followed by another [[understanding_points_and_their_properties | point]] on the [[line_segments_rays_and_lines_in_geometry | ray]], with an arrow pointing in the direction of infinite extension above (e.g., AD with an arrow from A to D) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. The order of letters *does* matter for [[line_segments_rays_and_lines_in_geometry | rays]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

### Lines
A [[line_segments_rays_and_lines_in_geometry | line]] extends infinitely in both directions through any two given [[understanding_points_and_their_properties | points]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.
*   **Property**: Unlike a [[line_segments_rays_and_lines_in_geometry | line segment]], a [[line_segments_rays_and_lines_in_geometry | line]] never ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   **Labeling**: A [[line_segments_rays_and_lines_in_geometry | line]] is specified by two [[understanding_points_and_their_properties | points]] on it with arrows on both ends above (e.g., EF with a double-headed arrow) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

## Colinear Points

[[understanding_points_and_their_properties | Points]] are considered **colinear** if they all lie on the same [[line_segments_rays_and_lines_in_geometry | line]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. If [[understanding_points_and_their_properties | points]] X, Y, and Z are on the same [[line_segments_rays_and_lines_in_geometry | line]], they are colinear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. This means they could also all sit on the same [[line_segments_rays_and_lines_in_geometry | line segment]] if that segment encompasses all of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

## Midpoints

A **midpoint** is a specific [[understanding_points_and_their_properties | point]] that lies exactly halfway between two other [[understanding_points_and_their_properties | points]] on a [[line_segments_rays_and_lines_in_geometry | line segment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.
*   **Property**: If [[understanding_points_and_their_properties | point]] Z is the midpoint of [[line_segments_rays_and_lines_in_geometry | line segment]] XY, then the distance from X to Z is equal to the distance from Z to Y (XZ = ZY) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. This also implies that X, Z, and Y must be colinear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

## Dimensions in Geometry

Geometry describes objects in terms of dimensions:
*   **Zero Dimensions**: A [[understanding_points_and_their_properties | point]] has zero dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   **One Dimension**: [[line_segments_rays_and_lines_in_geometry | Lines]], [[line_segments_rays_and_lines_in_geometry | line segments]], and [[line_segments_rays_and_lines_in_geometry | rays]] are one-dimensional, allowing movement in a single direction (forward/backward) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.
*   **Two Dimensions**: A **plane** is a two-dimensional object where movement is possible in two independent directions (e.g., left/right and up/down on a screen) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. A piece of paper, if it extended infinitely in all directions, would be considered a plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.
*   **Three Dimensions**: Our physical space is three-dimensional, allowing movement in left/right, up/down, and in/out directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.
*   **Higher Dimensions**: While difficult to visualize, mathematics can study objects with more than three dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

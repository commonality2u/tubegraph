[[Random Variables | Random variables]] are categorized into two main types: [[discrete_vs_continuous_random_variables | discrete]] and [[continuous_random_variables | continuous]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. [[Continuous Random Variables | Continuous random variables]] are those that can assume any value within a given range or interval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This range may even extend infinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Characteristics of Continuous Variables

Unlike [[Discrete Random Variables | discrete variables]] where values are distinct and countable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, [[Continuous Random Variables | continuous variables]] cannot be counted or listed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. Between any two possible values for a continuous variable, there exists an infinite number of other possible values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

## Examples

### Mass of an Animal
If a [[Random Variables | random variable]] *Y* is defined as the exact mass of a random animal selected at the New Orleans zoo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, this is a [[Continuous Random Variables | continuous random variable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. The exact mass can take on any value within a range, such as from nearly 0 kilograms (like an ant or bacterium) up to 5,000 kilograms or more (like a massive elephant) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. It's impossible to count or list all possible masses because there are infinite possibilities, like 123.75921 kilograms or 9.5710732 kilograms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

### Exact Winning Time in a Race
Consider a [[Random Variables | random variable]] *X* representing the exact winning time for the men's 100-meter dash at the 2016 Olympics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This is a [[Continuous Random Variables | continuous random variable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. While Olympic clocks might display times rounded to the nearest hundredth of a second (e.g., 9.56 or 9.57 seconds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>, the actual, precise time could be any value within an interval, such as 9.571 or 9.572359 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. The exact time can take on any value between possible bounds, like 5 and 12 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

### Contrast: Rounded Time as Discrete
If the winning time were defined as *rounded* to the nearest hundredth (e.g., 9.56, 9.57, 9.58) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>, it would then become a [[Discrete Random Variables | discrete random variable]] because the possible values could be listed and counted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

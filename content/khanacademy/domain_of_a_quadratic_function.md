The domain of a function refers to the set of all valid input values (x-values) for which the function is defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. For a given function, such as f(x) = 3x² + 6x - 2, the domain determines which real numbers can be used as inputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Defining the Domain for Quadratic Functions

For any [[quadratic_polynomials | quadratic function]], defined in the standard form ax² + bx + c, the domain is **all real numbers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This is because any real number can be:
*   Squared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>
*   Multiplied by a constant (e.g., 3x² or 6x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>
*   Added or subtracted from other terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>

There are no mathematical operations (like division by zero or taking the square root of a negative number) that would restrict the input values for a quadratic function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Therefore, the function f(x) = 3x² + 6x - 2, like all [[quadratic_polynomials | quadratic functions]], is defined for every real number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

### Real Numbers vs. Complex Numbers

When discussing the domain, "all real numbers" refers to the traditional numbers encountered in everyday mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This contrasts with "imaginary numbers" and "complex numbers," which are different classes of numbers not typically included unless specified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. For quadratic functions, unless otherwise noted, the domain is understood to be all real numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

While this article focuses on domain, understanding the [[range_of_a_quadratic_function | range of a quadratic function]] often involves [[graphing_a_quadratic_function | graphing a quadratic function]] and identifying its vertex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

The domain of a function refers to the set of all valid input values (x-values) for which the function is defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Defining the Domain for a Quadratic Function

Consider the [[Understanding quadratic expressions | quadratic expression]] function:
f(x) = 3x² + 6x - 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>

For this function, as with all [[Quadratic equations | quadratic functions]], any real number can be used as an input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. You can take any real number, square it, multiply it by 3, add 6 times that number, and then subtract 2 without encountering any mathematical restrictions (like division by zero or taking the square root of a negative number) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

Therefore, the domain for the function f(x) = 3x² + 6x - 2 is all real numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This holds true for any [[Understanding quadratic expressions | quadratic function]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

### What are Real Numbers?

When discussing the domain, "real numbers" refers to most traditional numbers encountered in mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This set includes all rational and irrational numbers. It excludes [[Quadratic equations | complex numbers]] and imaginary numbers, which are a different class of numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### Summary of Domain

*   **Function**: f(x) = 3x² + 6x - 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>
*   **Domain**: All real numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>

[[definition_of_trigonometry | Trigonometry]] is fundamentally the study of [[right_triangles_and_trigonometry | right triangles]] and the relationships between their sides and angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. It provides a means to understand how the ratios of a triangle's sides correspond to its angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Core Trigonometric Functions

The three [[core_trigonometric_functions_sine_cosine_and_tangent | core trigonometric functions]] are sine (sin), cosine (cos), and tangent (tan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. These relationships are easily remembered using the mnemonic SOH CAH TOA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>:
*   **SOH**: **S**ine = **O**pposite / **H**ypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>
*   **CAH**: **C**osine = **A**djacent / **H**ypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>
*   **TOA**: **T**angent = **O**pposite / **A**djacent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>

For a given angle within a [[right_triangles_and_trigonometry | right triangle]], the "opposite" side is directly across from the angle, the "adjacent" side is next to the angle (but not the hypotenuse), and the "hypotenuse" is always the longest side, opposite the right angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

## Utility of Trigonometry

The practical application of [[basics_of_trigonometry | trigonometry]] lies in its ability to determine unknown measurements of a [[right_triangles_and_trigonometry | right triangle]] when some information is already known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Specifically:
*   **Finding Angles**: If the lengths of the sides of a triangle are known, [[basics_of_trigonometry | trigonometry]] can be used (with a calculator or trig table) to calculate the values of its angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
*   **Finding Sides**: If an angle and at least one side length of a triangle are known, [[basics_of_trigonometry | trigonometry]] can be used to determine the lengths of the other sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

The speaker notes that these applications, which allow for calculating missing angles or sides, will be further demonstrated in a subsequent module <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

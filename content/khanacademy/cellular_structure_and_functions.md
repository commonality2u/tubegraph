Cells are the fundamental units of life, containing various components that perform specific roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.

## Basic Cellular Components

*   **Outer Membrane** The outermost boundary of a cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. [[cellular_membrane_and_its_role | Its primary role is to regulate the passage of substances into and out of the cell]].
*   **Nucleus** Found within a eukaryotic cell, the nucleus houses the [[dna_and_its_function_in_cells | DNA]] in the form of chromatin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.
*   **Cytoplasm** The fluidic space within the cell, located between the [[organelle_functions_such_as_ribosomes_endoplasmic_reticulum_and_golgi_bodies | organelles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. It is the site where [[cellular_respiration_phases | glycolysis]] occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
*   **[[organelle_functions_such_as_ribosomes_endoplasmic_reticulum_and_golgi_bodies | Organelles]]** Specialized parts of the cell that carry out specific functions, similar to how organs operate within the human body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.

### Mitochondria

Often referred to as the "power centers of the cell," [[photosynthesis_and_respiration_organelles_like_mitochondria_and_chloroplasts | mitochondria]] are critical for energy production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>, specifically during [[introduction_to_cellular_respiration | cellular respiration]].

#### Mitochondrial Structure
[[photosynthesis_and_respiration_organelles_like_mitochondria_and_chloroplasts | Mitochondria]] possess two membranes:
*   **Outer Membrane** The exterior boundary of the [[photosynthesis_and_respiration_organelles_like_mitochondria_and_chloroplasts | mitochondrion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.
*   **Inner Membrane (Cristae)** A convoluted inner membrane that forms folds called cristae (plural) or crista (singular) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.
    *   **Outer Compartment** The space located between the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.
    *   **Matrix** The inner compartment within the [[photosynthesis_and_respiration_organelles_like_mitochondria_and_chloroplasts | mitochondrion]], enclosed by the inner membrane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.

#### Mitochondrial Functions
The [[cellular_respiration_phases | Krebs cycle]] (or citric acid cycle) primarily takes place within the inner space or matrix of the [[photosynthesis_and_respiration_organelles_like_mitochondria_and_chloroplasts | mitochondria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. The [[cellular_respiration_phases | electron transport chain]] also relies on inputs generated here to produce the bulk of cellular ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>.

## Enzymes
[[organelle_functions_such_as_ribosomes_endoplasmic_reticulum_and_golgi_bodies | Enzymes]] are proteins that facilitate chemical reactions within the cell by bringing reactant molecules together in the correct orientation for reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. All reactions in the [[cellular_respiration_phases | Krebs cycle]] are enzyme-catalyzed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.

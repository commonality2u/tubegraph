While basic arithmetic deals with concrete numbers, such as "23 plus 5" equaling 28, or "2 times 7," where the exact numbers are known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, the [[introduction_to_algebra_and_its_importance | algebraic world]] introduces the concept of variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Variables

Variables are values within expressions that can change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. For example, in the expression "x plus 5," the value of this [[understanding_algebraic_expressions | expression]] depends on the value of 'x' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

Consider the expression `x + 5`:
*   If `x` equals 1, then `x + 5` evaluates to `1 + 5 = 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   If `x` equals -7, then `x + 5` evaluates to `-7 + 5 = -2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

This demonstrates that 'x' is a variable whose value can change based on the context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Expressions

An [[understanding_algebraic_expressions | expression]] is a statement of value or quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. The value of an expression changes depending on the values assigned to its variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

Examples of expressions:
*   `x + 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>
*   `y + z` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a> (where `y` and `z` are also variables)
*   `x^y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>
*   `sqrt(x + y) - x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>

## Equations

An equation is formed by setting two [[understanding_algebraic_expressions | expressions]] equal to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. This is why they are called "equations" â€“ because they equate two things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

For instance, `x + 3 = 1` is an equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. In this specific case, with one equation and one unknown, the value of `x` is constrained to -2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This constraint on the variable's value is a key aspect of equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

Equations can involve multiple variables, such as `x + y + z = 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Even here, if values for some variables are known, the others become constrained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. For example, if `y = 3` and `z = 2`, the equation becomes `x + 3 + 2 = 5`, which simplifies to `x + 5 = 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. In this scenario, `x` must be 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. The concept of [[understanding_equality_in_algebra | equality]] is fundamental to equations.

## Evaluating Expressions

To evaluate an [[understanding_algebraic_expressions | expression]], substitute the given values for its variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

### Example 1: `x^y`

*   **Case 1**: If `x = 5` and `y = 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
    *   The expression evaluates to `5^2 = 25` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **Case 2**: If `x = -2` and `y = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
    *   The expression evaluates to `(-2)^3 = -2 * -2 * -2 = -8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

### Example 2: `sqrt(x + y) - x`

*   If `x = 1` and `y = 8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
    *   Substitute the values: `sqrt(1 + 8) - 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
    *   This simplifies to `sqrt(9) - 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
    *   The principal root of 9 is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
    *   So, the expression evaluates to `3 - 1 = 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

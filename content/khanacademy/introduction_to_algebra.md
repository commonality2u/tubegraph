Unlike basic [[applying_arithmetic_to_algebra | arithmetic]], which deals with concrete numbers like 23 + 5 or 2 * 7, algebra introduces the concept of variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. In [[applying_arithmetic_to_algebra | arithmetic]], the numbers are always known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. When entering the algebraic world, you begin working with variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Variables

Variables are values within expressions that can change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Their values can vary depending on the context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

For example, in the expression `x + 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>:
*   If `x` is equal to 1, then `x + 5` becomes 1 + 5, which evaluates to 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   If `x` is equal to -7, then `x + 5` becomes -7 + 5, which evaluates to -2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

This demonstrates how `x` is a variable, and its value can change depending on the context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This flexibility is a core part of [[understanding_basic_algebraic_notation | basic algebraic notation]].

## Expressions

An expression is a statement of value or quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The value of an expression changes based on the values of the variables within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

Examples of expressions include:
*   `x + 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>
*   `y + z` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>: If `y` is 1 and `z` is 2, the expression evaluates to 1 + 2 = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. If `y` is 0 and `z` is -1, it evaluates to 0 + (-1) = -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

Expressions can always be evaluated to a specific value once the values of their variables are known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Equations

An equation is formed when two expressions are set equal to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. The term "equation" comes from "equating" two things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

For example, `x + 3 = 1` is an equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. In an equation with only one unknown variable, you can often determine what that variable needs to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. For `x + 3 = 1`, `x` must be -2 because -2 + 3 equals 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This is an [[introduction_to_linear_equations | introduction to linear equations]].

Equations constrain the possible values a variable can take on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

Another example of an equation is `x + y + z = 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. While there are multiple possible solutions for `x`, `y`, and `z`, if values for two of the variables are given, the third is constrained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. For instance, if `y = 3` and `z = 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>:
1.  The left side becomes `x + 3 + 2`, which simplifies to `x + 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
2.  The equation is then `x + 5 = 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
3.  This constrains `x` to be 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

In summary, the key difference is that an equation equates two expressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, and variables in algebra can take on different values depending on the problem's context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

## Evaluating Expressions

To further illustrate the concept of variables, consider evaluating expressions by substituting different values for the variables:

### Example 1: `x` to the power of `y` (`x^y`)
*   If `x = 5` and `y = 2`, the expression `x^y` becomes `5^2`, which evaluates to 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   If `x = -2` and `y = 3`, the expression `x^y` becomes `(-2)^3`, which evaluates to -2 * -2 * -2 = -8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

### Example 2: Square root of `x + y` minus `x` (`sqrt(x + y) - x`)
*   If `x = 1` and `y = 8`, the expression becomes `sqrt(1 + 8) - 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
*   First, `1 + 8` equals 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
*   The principal root of 9 is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   Then, `3 - 1` equals 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
The entire expression evaluates to 2 when `x=1` and `y=8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. This process of substituting numbers for variables and calculating is a core part of [[applying_arithmetic_to_algebra | applying arithmetic to algebra]].

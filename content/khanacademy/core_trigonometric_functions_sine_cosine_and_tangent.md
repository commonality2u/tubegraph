[[definition_of_trigonometry | Trigonometry]] is fundamentally the study of the ratios of sides of triangles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The term "trig" in trigonometry means triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, and "metry" means measure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This field, though it sounds complicated, is primarily about understanding these ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## [[right_triangles_and_trigonometry | Right Triangles]]

A [[right_triangles_and_trigonometry | right triangle]] is defined by having one angle that measures 90 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This 90-degree angle is also referred to as a right angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

In a [[right_triangles_and_trigonometry | right triangle]], the side opposite the 90-degree angle is called the hypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. The hypotenuse is always the longest side of a [[right_triangles_and_trigonometry | right triangle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

For example, a common [[right_triangles_and_trigonometry | right triangle]] has sides with lengths 3, 4, and 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This configuration satisfies the Pythagorean theorem, where 3 squared plus 4 squared equals 5 squared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## [[introduction_to_basic_trigonometric_functions | Core Trigonometric Functions]]

The core [[introduction_to_basic_trigonometric_functions | functions of trigonometry]] are:
*   The [[sine_cosine_and_tangent_functions | Sine]] function (sin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>
*   The [[sine_cosine_and_tangent_functions | Cosine]] function (cos) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>
*   The [[sine_cosine_and_tangent_functions | Tangent]] function (tan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>

These [[trigonometric_ratios_and_angle_identification | functions]] define the ratios of specific sides for any given angle within a [[right_triangles_and_trigonometry | right triangle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

### [[mnemonic_device_for_remembering_trigonometric_functions | Mnemonic Device]]: SOH CAH TOA

To remember the definitions of these [[introduction_to_basic_trigonometric_functions | functions]], a helpful [[mnemonic_device_for_remembering_trigonometric_functions | mnemonic]] is "SOH CAH TOA" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>:

> [!tip] SOH CAH TOA
> *   **SOH**: [[sine_cosine_and_tangent_functions | Sine]] is Opposite over Hypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>
> *   **CAH**: [[sine_cosine_and_tangent_functions | Cosine]] is Adjacent over Hypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>
> *   **TOA**: [[sine_cosine_and_tangent_functions | Tangent]] is Opposite over Adjacent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>

The terms "opposite" and "adjacent" refer to the sides of the triangle relative to a specific angle being considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. The hypotenuse remains constant for the triangle, but the opposite and adjacent sides change depending on which angle (other than the right angle) is being referenced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

## Applying the Functions

Consider a [[right_triangles_and_trigonometry | right triangle]] with sides 3, 4, and 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### For Angle Theta (θ)

Let's define an angle θ between the side of length 4 and the hypotenuse of length 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

*   The side **opposite** to θ is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   The side **adjacent** to θ is 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   The **hypotenuse** is 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

Using SOH CAH TOA:
*   **[[sine_cosine_and_tangent_functions | Sine]] of θ (sin θ)**: Opposite / Hypotenuse = 3 / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>
*   **[[sine_cosine_and_tangent_functions | Cosine]] of θ (cos θ)**: Adjacent / Hypotenuse = 4 / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>
*   **[[sine_cosine_and_tangent_functions | Tangent]] of θ (tan θ)**: Opposite / Adjacent = 3 / 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>

If an angle has a specific measure, the ratio of its opposite side to its hypotenuse will always be the same, regardless of the triangle's size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

### For Angle X

Now, let's consider the other acute angle in the same triangle, labeled as x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

*   The side **opposite** to x is 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   The side **adjacent** to x is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   The **hypotenuse** is still 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

Using SOH CAH TOA:
*   **[[sine_cosine_and_tangent_functions | Sine]] of x (sin x)**: Opposite / Hypotenuse = 4 / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>
*   **[[sine_cosine_and_tangent_functions | Cosine]] of x (cos x)**: Adjacent / Hypotenuse = 3 / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>
*   **[[sine_cosine_and_tangent_functions | Tangent]] of x (tan x)**: Opposite / Adjacent = 4 / 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>

These three basic [[trigonometric_ratios_and_angle_identification | trigonometric ratios]] form the foundation of [[basics_of_trigonometry | trigonometry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Other [[trigonometric_ratios_and_angle_identification | trig ratios]] can be derived from these basic [[introduction_to_basic_trigonometric_functions | functions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. While the SOH CAH TOA definition is highly useful for angles between 0 and 90 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>, further definitions are needed for angles approaching or exceeding 90 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

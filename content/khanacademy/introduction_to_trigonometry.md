## What is Trigonometry?
[[introduction_to_basic_trigonometry|Trigonometry]] may sound like a complex subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, but it is fundamentally the study of the ratios of sides of triangles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The word "trig" in trigonometry means triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, and "metry" means measure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Right Triangles
Trigonometry is often introduced using right triangles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. A right triangle is defined by having one angle that measures 90 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This 90-degree angle is known as a right angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

For example, consider a right triangle with side lengths 3, 4, and 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### The Hypotenuse
In a right triangle, the hypotenuse is the side located opposite the right angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. It is always the longest side of a right triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. You may have learned about it in [[introduction_to_geometry_terms|geometry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### [[introduction_to_the_pythagorean_theorem|Pythagorean Theorem]]
The sides of a right triangle satisfy the [[introduction_to_the_pythagorean_theorem|Pythagorean theorem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. For the example triangle with sides 3, 4, and 5, this means 3² + 4² = 5² <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## [[basic_trigonometric_functions_sine_cosine_and_tangent|Core Trigonometric Functions]]
The fundamental [[trigonometric_functions_and_their_definitions|core functions of trigonometry]] are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>:
*   The [[basic_trigonometric_functions_sine_cosine_and_tangent|sine function]] (sin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>
*   The [[basic_trigonometric_functions_sine_cosine_and_tangent|cosine function]] (cos) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>
*   The [[basic_trigonometric_functions_sine_cosine_and_tangent|tangent function]] (tan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>

These functions define specific ratios of sides for any given angle within a triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

### The [[sohcahtoa_mnemonic_for_trigonometric_functions|SOHCAHTOA]] Mnemonic
To remember the definitions of these functions, the mnemonic [[sohcahtoa_mnemonic_for_trigonometric_functions|soh cah toa]] is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

*   **SOH**: **S**ine = **O**pposite / **H**ypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>
*   **CAH**: **C**osine = **A**djacent / **H**ypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>
*   **TOA**: **T**angent = **O**pposite / **A**djacent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>

The terms "opposite" and "adjacent" refer to the sides relative to a specific angle in the triangle.

## [[applying_trigonometry_to_different_angles_in_a_triangle|Applying Trigonometry]]

Let's use the 3-4-5 right triangle to illustrate how to calculate these [[calculating_trigonometric_functions_sine_cosine_tangent|trig functions]].

### Example: Angle Theta (θ)
Consider an angle, theta (θ), located between the sides of length 4 and 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

*   **Opposite side**: The side across from theta is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **Adjacent side**: The side next to theta (not the hypotenuse) is 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   **Hypotenuse**: The longest side, opposite the right angle, is 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

Using [[sohcahtoa_mnemonic_for_trigonometric_functions|SOHCAHTOA]]:
*   **Sine (θ)** = Opposite / Hypotenuse = 3 / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>
*   **Cosine (θ)** = Adjacent / Hypotenuse = 4 / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>
*   **Tangent (θ)** = Opposite / Adjacent = 3 / 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>

The ratio of opposite to hypotenuse will always be the same for a given angle, regardless of the triangle's overall size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

### Example: Angle X
Now, let's consider the other non-right angle in the same 3-4-5 triangle, let's call it 'x' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. The terms "opposite" and "adjacent" depend on which angle you are referencing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

*   **Opposite side**: For angle x, the opposite side is 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   **Adjacent side**: For angle x, the adjacent side (not the hypotenuse) is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
*   **Hypotenuse**: Remains 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

Using [[sohcahtoa_mnemonic_for_trigonometric_functions|SOHCAHTOA]]:
*   **Sine (x)** = Opposite / Hypotenuse = 4 / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>
*   **Cosine (x)** = Adjacent / Hypotenuse = 3 / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>
*   **Tangent (x)** = Opposite / Adjacent = 4 / 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>

## Beyond Basic Applications
While the [[sohcahtoa_mnemonic_for_trigonometric_functions|SOHCAHTOA]] definition is effective for angles between 0 and 90 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>, new definitions are introduced for finding the [[calculating_trigonometric_functions_sine_cosine_tangent|sine, cosine, and tangent]] of angles that are larger than 90 degrees or at the boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

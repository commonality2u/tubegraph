[[introduction_to_basic_trigonometry | Trigonometry]], derived from Ancient Greek, means "triangle measure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. It is the study of right triangles and the relationships between their sides and angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Right Triangles
A right triangle is a triangle containing a 90-degree angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. In a right triangle, the longest side, or the side opposite the right angle, is called the hypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

For any given angle within a right triangle, the [[trigonometric_functions_definition_for_right_triangles | trig functions]] define the ratios of the sides relative to that angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The Greek letter theta (θ) is commonly used to denote the angle for which the [[trigonometric_functions_definition_for_right_triangles | trig function]] is being found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## SOH CAH TOA
To remember the definitions of the basic [[trigonometric_functions_definition_for_right_triangles | trigonometric functions]], a useful mnemonic is [[using_soh_cah_toa_to_determine_trigonometric_ratios | SOH CAH TOA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>:
*   **SOH**: **S**ine is **O**pposite over **H**ypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>
*   **CAH**: **C**osine is **A**djacent over **H**ypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>
*   **TOA**: **T**angent is **O**pposite over **A**djacent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>

### Sine (sin)
The [[trigonometric_functions_sine_cosine_and_tangent | sine]] of an angle (e.g., [[finding_sine_cosine_and_tangent | sine of theta]]) is defined as the ratio of the length of the side **opposite** the angle to the length of the **hypotenuse** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **Example**: In a right triangle with sides 3, 4, and hypotenuse 5, for an angle θ, if the side opposite θ is 4 and the hypotenuse is 5, then the [[finding_sine_cosine_and_tangent | sine of theta]] = Opposite / Hypotenuse = 4/5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

### Cosine (cos)
The [[trigonometric_functions_sine_cosine_and_tangent | cosine]] of an angle (e.g., [[finding_sine_cosine_and_tangent | cosine of theta]]) is defined as the ratio of the length of the side **adjacent** to the angle to the length of the **hypotenuse** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. The adjacent side is the side next to the angle, not the hypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   **Example**: In the same triangle, for angle θ, if the adjacent side is 3 and the hypotenuse is 5, then the [[finding_sine_cosine_and_tangent | cosine of theta]] = Adjacent / Hypotenuse = 3/5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

### Tangent (tan)
The [[trigonometric_functions_sine_cosine_and_tangent | tangent]] of an angle (e.g., [[finding_sine_cosine_and_tangent | tangent of theta]]) is defined as the ratio of the length of the side **opposite** the angle to the length of the side **adjacent** to the angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   **Example 1**: For angle θ, if the opposite side is 4 and the adjacent side is 3, then the [[finding_sine_cosine_and_tangent | tangent of theta]] = Opposite / Adjacent = 4/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   **Example 2**: For another angle, x, in the same triangle, if the side opposite x is 3 and the side adjacent to x is 4, then the [[finding_sine_cosine_and_tangent | tangent of x]] = 3/4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> When calculating [[trigonometric_functions_definition_for_right_triangles | trig functions]], it is crucial which angle of the right triangle is chosen, as this determines which sides are considered "opposite" or "adjacent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

## Applications
While seemingly confusing at first, [[introduction_to_basic_trigonometry | trigonometry]] can be straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. It is often taught in [[introduction_to_algebra | Precalculus]], but the concepts can be grasped earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

One of the main [[realworld_applications_of_trigonometry | realworld applications of trigonometry]] is to find unknown angles or side lengths of a right triangle if certain information (e.g., an angle and a side, or two sides) is already known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. This can be done using tools like a slide rule, [[trigonometric_functions_and_right_triangles | trig table]], or calculator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. More examples and applications will be covered in subsequent modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

From: [[khanacademy]] <br/> 

When analyzing different scenarios, particularly in economics or resource allocation, it's common to make the assumption of *ceteris paribus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:29">[01:48:29]</a>. This is a Latin term used to signify that "all other things are equal" or "all other things are being held equal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:19">[01:58:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:19">[02:39:19]</a>.

### Definition
The term *ceteris* means "all other things" and is related to "et cetera" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:04">[02:08:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:15">[02:17:15]</a>. *Paribus* translates to "equal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:23">[02:21:23]</a>. Therefore, when discussing a change and stating *ceteris paribus*, it implies that only the variable under consideration is changing, while all other relevant factors remain constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:04">[02:05:04]</a>.

### Application in Scenarios
In the context of a hunter-gatherer deciding how much time to spend hunting rabbits versus gathering berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, *ceteris paribus* is applied when comparing different resource allocation scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:02">[01:28:02]</a>.

When moving from one scenario (e.g., Scenario A: 5 rabbits, 0 berries) to another (e.g., Scenario B: 4 rabbits, 100 berries) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:04">[00:58:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>, the *ceteris paribus* assumption means that:
*   The total amount of time available for hunting or gathering remains constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:04">[01:33:04]</a>.
*   The amount of sleep or personal time does not change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:06">[01:37:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:02">[02:28:02]</a>.
*   The techniques for hunting or gathering are not improved or altered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:29">[01:38:29]</a>.
*   The geographical location or available tools and technology remain the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:30">[02:30:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:10">[02:35:10]</a>.
*   No other activities are undertaken with the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:07">[01:44:07]</a>.

The only variable being changed is the allocation of time between hunting rabbits and gathering berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:24">[02:40:24]</a>. This allows for a clear analysis of the trade-offs involved in different resource allocations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:16">[02:46:16]</a>.

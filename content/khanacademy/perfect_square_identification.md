[[Completing the square technique | Completing the square]] is a technique used to [[solving_quadratic_equations | solve quadratic equations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. It forms the foundation for the [[introduction_to_the_quadratic_formula | quadratic formula]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. This method expands on prior knowledge of [[square_roots_and_perfect_squares | perfect squares]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.

The essence of [[completing_the_square_technique | completing the square]] involves manipulating a quadratic equation to transform one side into a [[square_roots_and_perfect_squares | perfect square]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>. This is achieved by adding and subtracting specific values from both sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.

## Identifying and Constructing a Perfect Square

For a quadratic expression in the form `x² + bx + c` to be a [[square_roots_and_perfect_squares | perfect square]], it must fit the pattern `(x + a)²` or `(x - a)²` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

When expanding `(x + a)²`, the result is `x² + 2ax + a²` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. Similarly, `(x - a)²` expands to `x² - 2ax + a²` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.

To identify or create a perfect square, observe the following pattern:
1.  The coefficient of the `x` term (`b`) must be `2a` (or `-2a` for `x - a`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.
2.  The constant term (`c`) must be `a²` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

From this, the value `a` can be determined by taking half of the coefficient of the `x` term (`b/2`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. The number needed to "complete" the square (the constant term `c`) is then `a²` or `(b/2)²` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>.

## Example: Completing the Square for `x² - 4x = 5`

To make the left side of the equation `x² - 4x` a [[square_roots_and_perfect_squares | perfect square]]:
1.  Identify the coefficient of the `x` term, which is `-4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.
2.  Take half of this coefficient: `-4 / 2 = -2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. This value is `a` (or what `a` would be in `(x-a)²`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.
3.  Square this result: `(-2)² = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.
4.  Add `4` to both sides of the equation to maintain balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.
    `x² - 4x + 4 = 5 + 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>
5.  The left side `x² - 4x + 4` now transforms into the [[square_roots_and_perfect_squares | perfect square]] `(x - 2)²` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
6.  The equation becomes `(x - 2)² = 9` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

This transformed equation can then be easily [[solving_quadratic_equations | solved]] by taking the [[square_roots_and_perfect_squares | square root]] of both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. While this specific example could also be [[factoring_quadratics | factored]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>, [[completing_the_square_technique | completing the square]] is universally applicable, even for [[factoring_quadratic_equations | quadratic equations]] that are difficult or impossible to [[factoring_quadratics | factor]] traditionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>.

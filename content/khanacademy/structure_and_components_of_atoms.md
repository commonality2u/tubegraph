For thousands of years, humans have observed that different substances exist in the environment, each possessing unique properties. These properties can include how they reflect light, their color, or their state (liquid, gas, or solid) at a given temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Substances also react with each other in specific ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Examples of such substances include carbon (in its graphite form), lead, and gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. These substances can also change states; for instance, gold or lead can become liquid if heated sufficiently, and carbon can turn into a gaseous state if burned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Elements

A fundamental question that was once philosophical, but can now be answered, is whether there is a smallest unit of a substance that still retains its properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. The answer is yes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. These pure substances, characterized by specific properties at certain temperatures and distinct reactive behaviors, are called [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | elements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

Examples of [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | elements]] include:
*   Carbon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>
*   Lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>
*   Gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>
*   Oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>
*   Hydrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>

Historically, water was sometimes referred to as an element, but it is now known to be composed of more basic [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | elements]]: oxygen and hydrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. All known [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | elements]] are systematically listed in the [[periodic_table_and_atomic_number | Periodic Table of Elements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## The Atom: The Basic Unit of an Element

The most basic unit of any [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | element]] is the atom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. If a substance like carbon or gold were continuously broken down into smaller chunks, the smallest piece that would still retain the properties of that substance would be a carbon atom or a gold atom, respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Breaking it down further would cause it to lose the characteristic properties of the [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | element]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

Atoms are incredibly small, almost unimaginably so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. For example, a human hair, which is primarily made of carbon, is approximately one million carbon atoms wide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

## Components of an Atom

While atoms are the [[basic_building_blocks_of_matter | basic building block]] of [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | elements]], they are themselves composed of even more fundamental particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. The arrangement and number of these fundamental particles define the [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | element]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Altering the number of these particles can change the element's properties or even transform it into a different element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

The three primary constituents of an atom are:

1.  **Proton**
    *   The number of protons is the defining characteristic of an [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | element]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
    *   Protons reside in the atom's center, called the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
    *   The [[periodic_table_and_atomic_number | Periodic Table]] arranges [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | elements]] by their atomic number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
    *   The atomic number literally represents the number of protons in an [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | element]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. For example, hydrogen has one proton, helium has two, and carbon has six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
    *   Changing the number of protons fundamentally changes the element; six protons define carbon, but adding a seventh proton transforms it into nitrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
    *   Protons carry a positive charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

2.  **Neutron**
    *   Neutrons are also located in the nucleus of the atom, alongside protons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
    *   Unlike protons, the number of neutrons can vary within the same [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | element]] without changing its identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. For example, carbon-12 has six protons and six neutrons, while carbon-14 still has six protons but eight neutrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
    *   The total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus gives the atomic mass number (e.g., carbon-12 has a total of 12 protons and neutrons) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
    *   Neutrons are neutral, meaning they carry no electrical charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

3.  **Electron**
    *   [[electrons_and_chemical_reactions | Electrons]] are located outside the nucleus, often conceptualized as "buzzing" or "jumping around" it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. While not precisely orbiting like planets, this is a useful initial mental model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
    *   [[electrons_and_chemical_reactions | Electrons]] carry a negative charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
    *   Unlike charges attract each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Therefore, [[electrons_and_chemical_reactions | electrons]] are attracted to the positively charged protons in the nucleus, which keeps them bound to the atom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.
    *   In a neutral atom, the number of [[electrons_and_chemical_reactions | electrons]] is equal to the number of protons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. For example, a neutral carbon atom (carbon-12) has six protons and six [[electrons_and_chemical_reactions | electrons]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
    *   The number of [[electrons_and_chemical_reactions | electrons]] can change without altering the element's identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. If an atom gains or loses [[electrons_and_chemical_reactions | electrons]], it becomes an ion with a net electrical charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. Losing an electron, for instance, would result in a net positive charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
    *   The configuration and number of [[electrons_and_chemical_reactions | electrons]] within an atom are crucial for understanding chemical reactions and how atoms interact, bond, or repel each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

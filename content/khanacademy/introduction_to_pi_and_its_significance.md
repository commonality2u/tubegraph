The circle is considered a fundamental shape in the universe, appearing in orbits of planets, wheels, and even at a molecular level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Understanding its properties is therefore worthwhile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Defining a Circle

A circle is defined as all points equidistant from a central point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

### Key Terms
*   **[[definition_and_importance_of_radius | Radius]]**: The [[definition_and_importance_of_radius | radius]] of a circle is the constant distance from the center to any point on its edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This distance never changes for a given circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   **Diameter**: The diameter is the distance across the widest point of the circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This line passes through the center of the circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The diameter is equal to two times the [[definition_and_importance_of_radius | radius]] (D = 2r) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   **Circumference**: The circumference is the distance around the circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## The Discovery of Pi (π)

Ancient mathematicians observed that the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter was consistently fixed for any circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. Early measurements with less accurate tools often suggested this ratio was approximately 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. As measuring tools improved, more precise values emerged, such as 3.1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>, and eventually 3.14159, with digits continuing indefinitely without repeating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

This "strange fascinating metaphysical number" that consistently appeared was given the name **Pi** (π) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. Pi (π) is considered one of the most fascinating and fundamental numbers in the universe, appearing not just in circles but throughout various mathematical concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

## Formulas Involving Pi

The fundamental relationship defining Pi is:
Circumference / Diameter = π <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>

From this, the formulas for circumference can be derived:
*   **Circumference (C)** = π × Diameter (d) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>
*   Since Diameter (d) = 2 × [[definition_and_importance_of_radius | Radius]] (r), the formula can also be written as:
    **Circumference (C)** = 2 × π × [[definition_and_importance_of_radius | Radius]] (r) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>

## Examples

### Calculating Circumference
If a circle has a [[definition_and_importance_of_radius | radius]] of 3 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>:
*   Circumference = 2 × π × 3 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>
*   Circumference = 6π meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>
*   The diameter would be 2 × 3 = 6 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

It is common practice to leave answers in terms of π for simplicity, as π is a long, non-repeating decimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

### Calculating Diameter and Radius from Circumference
If a circle has a circumference of 10 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>:
*   We know that π × Diameter = Circumference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>
*   So, π × Diameter = 10 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>
*   Diameter = 10 / π meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>
*   The [[definition_and_importance_of_radius | radius]] is half of the diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>, so:
    *   [[definition_and_importance_of_radius | Radius]] = (1/2) × (10 / π) = 5 / π meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>

Pi is fundamentally a number, approximately 3.14159, and while it's a very special number, it behaves like any other constant in mathematical operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

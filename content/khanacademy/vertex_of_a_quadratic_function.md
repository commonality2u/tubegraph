The vertex of a [[graphing_quadratic_functions | quadratic function]] is a crucial point that determines the parabola's turning point, whether it's a minimum or a maximum value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>. This point is essential for understanding the [[range_of_a_quadratic_function | range of a quadratic function]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

## Significance for the Range

For a quadratic function, which always forms a parabolic shape when [[graphing_quadratic_functions | graphed]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>:
*   If the parabola opens upwards (like f(x) = 3x² + 6x - 2), the vertex represents the *minimum* point of the function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>, meaning the function will not take on any values below its vertex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.
*   If the parabola opens downwards, the vertex represents the *maximum* point, meaning the function will not take on any values above its vertex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

This minimum or maximum y-value (the y-coordinate of the vertex) directly defines the boundary for the function's [[range_of_a_quadratic_function | range]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>. For the function `f(x) = 3x² + 6x - 2`, the vertex is at y = -5, meaning the function's outputs (its range) will be all real numbers greater than or equal to -5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>.

## Calculating the Vertex

The x-coordinate of the vertex for any [[understanding_quadratic_expressions | quadratic expression]] in the standard form `ax² + bx + c` can be found using the formula:

`x = -b / 2a` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>

This formula is derived directly from the [[quadratic_formula_introduction | quadratic formula]], which itself is obtained by [[factoring_quadratic_polynomials | completing the square]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

### Example Calculation

For the function `f(x) = 3x² + 6x - 2`:
*   `a = 3`
*   `b = 6`
*   `c = -2`

To find the x-coordinate of the vertex:
`x = -b / 2a` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>
`x = -6 / (2 * 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>
`x = -6 / 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>
`x = -1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>

To find the y-coordinate of the vertex, substitute this x-value back into the function:
`f(-1) = 3(-1)² + 6(-1) - 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>
`f(-1) = 3(1) - 6 - 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>
`f(-1) = 3 - 6 - 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>
`f(-1) = -3 - 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>
`f(-1) = -5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>

Therefore, the vertex of the function `f(x) = 3x² + 6x - 2` is at `(-1, -5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.

## Graphical Interpretation and Symmetry

The vertex is the point around which the parabola exhibits symmetry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. If a vertical line is drawn through the x-coordinate of the vertex (`x = -1` in the example), the two sides of the parabola are mirror images of each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>. This symmetry can be observed by evaluating the function at x-values equidistant from the vertex's x-coordinate:
*   At `x = -1` (vertex), `f(x) = -5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>
*   At `x = 0` (one unit to the right of -1), `f(x) = -2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>
*   At `x = -2` (one unit to the left of -1), `f(x) = -2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>

This confirms the symmetry and helps identify the vertex as the point where the function's output changes direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.

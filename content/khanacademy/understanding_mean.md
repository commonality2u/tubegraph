Statistics is a field dedicated to understanding and interpreting data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. A significant part of this involves **descriptive statistics**, which aims to summarize large datasets with a smaller set of numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This allows for a concise description of the data without presenting every single data point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Describing Data with a Single Number

When faced with a set of numbers, such as plant heights (e.g., 4, 3, 1, 6, 1, 7 inches) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, one common question is how to represent them with a single, typical number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This search for a "typical number," a "middle number," or the "most frequent number" is what led to the development of descriptive statistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## The Concept of "Average"

In statistics, "average" is a general term that refers to a number that represents a typical or middle value within a dataset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. It is an attempt to find a [[mean_and_central_tendency | measure of central tendency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. While in everyday language, "average" often refers to a specific calculation, statistics recognizes many types of averages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## The Arithmetic Mean

The most common type of average, and the one typically referred to as "average" in daily conversation (e.g., "average on this exam"), is the **arithmetic mean** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

### Definition and Calculation
The arithmetic mean is defined as the sum of all numbers in a dataset divided by the total number of numbers in that set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. This definition is a human-constructed one, found to be useful for describing data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

Let's use the plant height data set: 4, 3, 1, 6, 1, 7 inches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

To [[calculating_mean | calculate the mean]]:
1.  **Sum the numbers**: 4 + 3 + 1 + 6 + 1 + 7 = 22 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
2.  **Count the numbers**: There are 6 data points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
3.  **Divide the sum by the count**: 22 / 6 = 3 and 4/6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This can be simplified to 3 and 2/3, or approximately 3.6 repeating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

So, the arithmetic mean for this dataset is 3 and 2/3 (or 3.6 repeating) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. This number serves as a representative value or a [[mean_and_central_tendency | measure of central tendency]] for the data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

### Mean vs. Other Measures of Central Tendency
While the arithmetic mean is widely used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>, there are other ways to measure an "average" or typical value, such as the [[understanding_median | median]] and the [[understanding_mode | mode]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. These different measures of central tendency are useful in different contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. The mean can be significantly affected by "crazy numbers" or outliers, in which case the median might be a more robust measure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

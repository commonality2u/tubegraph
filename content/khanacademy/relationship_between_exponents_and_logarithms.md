Logarithms are fundamentally about figuring out what power you have to raise a base to, to get another number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This concept explores the [[inverse_relationship_between_logarithms_and_exponents | inverse relationship between logarithms and exponents]].

## Understanding the "What Power?" Question

We are familiar with exponents, such as calculating 2 to the fourth power, which means 2 multiplied by itself 4 times, resulting in 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

However, logarithms address the inverse question: if we start with a base (e.g., 2) and know the result (e.g., 16), what power `x` must the base be raised to to achieve that result? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a> For instance, if 2 to the power of `x` equals 16, then `x` must be 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Logarithm Notation

The way to denote this relationship using [[logarithm_notation | logarithm notation]] is `log base b of x = y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

For example, asking "what power do I need to raise 2 to, to get 16?" is written as:
`log base 2 of 16 = x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>

This logarithmic statement is completely equivalent to the exponential statement:
`2^x = 16` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>

In this case, `x` is 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## Evaluating Logarithmic Expressions

[[evaluating_logarithmic_expressions | Evaluating logarithmic expressions]] means determining the exponent.

### [[examples_of_logarithmic_calculations | Example 1]]: `log base 3 of 81`

To evaluate `log base 3 of 81` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, we ask: "what power do we have to raise 3 to, to get to 81?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>

We can set this to `x`: `3^x = 81` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
By experimenting with powers of 3:
*   3 to the first power = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>
*   3 to the second power = 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>
*   3 to the third power = 27 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>
*   3 to the fourth power = 81 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>

So, `log base 3 of 81 = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

### [[examples_of_logarithmic_calculations | Example 2]]: `log base 6 of 216`

This asks: "what power do we have to raise 6 to, to get 216?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>
*   6 to the first power = 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>
*   6 to the second power = 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>
*   6 to the third power = 216 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>

Therefore, `log base 6 of 216 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

### [[examples_of_logarithmic_calculations | Example 3]]: `log base 2 of 64`

This asks: "the exponent that I have to raise 2 to, to get to 64" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   2^1 = 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>
*   2^2 = 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>
*   2^3 = 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>
*   2^4 = 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>
*   2^5 = 32 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>
*   2^6 = 64 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>

So, `log base 2 of 64 = 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

## [[special_cases_in_logarithms | Special Cases]]

### [[special_cases_in_logarithms | Logarithm of 1]]: `log base 100 of 1`

To evaluate `log base 100 of 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>, we ask: "what power do I have to raise 100 to, to get to 1?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>
If we set this to `x`: `100^x = 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> Any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 is equal to 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

Therefore, `log base 100 of 1 = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
In general, `log base anything of 1 will be equal to 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

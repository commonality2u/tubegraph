The study of [[introduction_to_logarithms | logarithms]] is fundamentally linked to the concept of exponents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Understanding Exponents

An exponent represents repeated multiplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. For example:
*   2 to the fourth power (2^4) means 2 multiplied by itself 4 times: 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
*   Calculating this, 2 × 2 = 4, 4 × 2 = 8, and 8 × 2 = 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. So, 2^4 = 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Introduction to Logarithms

While exponents help us find the result of a base raised to a power (e.g., 2^4 = ?), logarithms help us find the *power* to which a base must be raised to get a certain number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This represents an [[inverse_relationship_between_logarithms_and_exponents | inverse relationship between logarithms and exponents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

Consider the question: "What power do you have to raise 2 to, to get 16?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a> As we determined, that power is 4 (2^4 = 16) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

### Logarithm Notation and Equivalence

The way to denote this question using [[logarithm_properties_and_notation | logarithm notation]] is:
`log base 2 of 16 = x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>

This logarithmic statement is completely equivalent to the exponential statement:
`2^x = 16` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>

Both forms ask the same question: "What power (x) do I need to raise 2 to, to get 16?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a> The answer, in this case, is `x = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

[[examples_of_calculating_logarithms | Examples of calculating logarithms]] demonstrate how to find the unknown exponent.

### Example 1: log base 3 of 81

`log base 3 of 81 = ?` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>

This asks: "What power do I have to raise 3 to, to get 81?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>
You can set this equal to `x` and rewrite it as an exponential equation: `3^x = 81` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

Let's test powers of 3:
*   3^1 = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>
*   3^2 = 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>
*   3^3 = 27 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>
*   3^4 = 27 × 3 = 81 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>

Therefore, `log base 3 of 81 = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

### Example 2: log base 6 of 216

`log base 6 of 216 = ?` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>

This asks: "What power do we have to raise 6 to, to get 216?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>
Let's test powers of 6:
*   6^1 = 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>
*   6^2 = 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>
*   6^3 = 36 × 6 = 216 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>

So, `log base 6 of 216 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

### Example 3: log base 2 of 64

`log base 2 of 64 = ?` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>

This asks: "What exponent do I have to raise 2 to, to get to 64?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>
Let's test powers of 2:
*   2^1 = 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>
*   2^2 = 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>
*   2^3 = 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>
*   2^4 = 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>
*   2^5 = 32 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>
*   2^6 = 64 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>

Thus, `log base 2 of 64 = 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Example 4: log base 100 of 1

`log base 100 of 1 = ?` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>

This asks: "What power do I have to raise 100 to, to get to 1?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>
Setting this to `x`: `100^x = 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

*   Any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 is equal to 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   Therefore, `x = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

So, `log base 100 of 1 = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

> [!tip] Special Property
> `log base b of 1 = 0` for any base `b` (where `b` is not 0), because `b^0 = 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

The circle is considered a fundamental shape in the universe, appearing in natural phenomena like planetary orbits and on a molecular level, as well as in human inventions like wheels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Understanding its [[properties_of_right_triangles | properties]] is therefore worthwhile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Defining a Circle

A circle is defined as all of the [[understanding_points_and_their_properties | points]] that are equally distant from a central point, known as the center of the circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. All [[understanding_points_and_their_properties | points]] along the edge of the circle are equidistant from its center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### The Radius

The equal distance from the center to any [[understanding_points_and_their_properties | point]] on the edge of the circle is called the [[definition_and_role_of_radius_in_circles | radius]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. For a given circle, the [[definition_and_role_of_radius_in_circles | radius]] never changes; for instance, if one [[definition_and_role_of_radius_in_circles | radius]] is 3 centimeters, all radii of that circle will be 3 centimeters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### The Diameter

The diameter is the widest point of a circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. It is a distance that cuts across the circle through its center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The diameter is essentially two radii extending in opposite directions from the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

The [[understanding_the_diameter_and_its_relation_to_the_radius | diameter]] has a simple relationship with the [[definition_and_role_of_radius_in_circles | radius]]:
$ \text{Diameter} = 2 \times \text{Radius} $ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>

### The Circumference

The [[calculating_circumference_and_its_relationship_with_diameter | circumference]] of a circle is the total distance around its edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. It's akin to the [[basics_of_perimeter_and_area | perimeter]] of other shapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## The Significance of Pi (π)

For thousands of years, mathematicians observed a consistent ratio between a circle's [[calculating_circumference_and_its_relationship_with_diameter | circumference]] and its [[understanding_the_diameter_and_its_relation_to_the_radius | diameter]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Early measurements, using less precise tools, suggested this ratio was roughly 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. As measurement tools improved, the ratio was found to be closer to 3.1, then 3.14159, with digits continuing indefinitely without repeating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

This unique, non-repeating, non-terminating number is fundamental to the universe and consistently appears for every circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. It was given the name "[[explaining_the_significance_of_pi_in_circle_calculations | pi]]" (π), represented by the Greek letter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

The definition of [[explaining_the_significance_of_pi_in_circle_calculations | pi]] is the ratio of the [[calculating_circumference_and_its_relationship_with_diameter | circumference]] (C) to the [[understanding_the_diameter_and_its_relation_to_the_radius | diameter]] (D):
$ \pi = \frac{C}{D} $ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>

### Circumference Formulas

From the definition of [[explaining_the_significance_of_pi_in_circle_calculations | pi]], the [[calculating_circumference_and_its_relationship_with_diameter | circumference]] can be calculated as:
$ C = \pi \times D $ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>

Since the [[understanding_the_diameter_and_its_relation_to_the_radius | diameter]] is equal to 2 times the [[definition_and_role_of_radius_in_circles | radius]] ($D = 2R$), the formula can also be expressed in terms of the [[definition_and_role_of_radius_in_circles | radius]]:
$ C = \pi \times 2 \times R $ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>
This is commonly written as:
$ C = 2\pi R $ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>

### Practical Examples

**Example 1: Given Radius**
If a circle has a [[definition_and_role_of_radius_in_circles | radius]] (R) of 3 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>:
*   **Circumference:** Using $C = 2\pi R$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>
    $C = 2 \times \pi \times 3 \text{ meters} = 6\pi \text{ meters}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>
    *Note:* [[explaining_the_significance_of_pi_in_circle_calculations | Pi]] is just a number (approximately 3.14159...), so $6\pi$ represents an exact value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
*   **Diameter:** Using $D = 2R$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>
    $D = 2 \times 3 \text{ meters} = 6 \text{ meters}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>

**Example 2: Given Circumference**
If a circle has a [[calculating_circumference_and_its_relationship_with_diameter | circumference]] (C) of 10 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>:
*   **Diameter:** Using $C = \pi D$, we can rearrange to find $D = \frac{C}{\pi}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>
    $D = \frac{10 \text{ meters}}{\pi} = \frac{10}{\pi} \text{ meters}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>
*   **Radius:** The [[definition_and_role_of_radius_in_circles | radius]] is half of the [[understanding_the_diameter_and_its_relation_to_the_radius | diameter]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>
    $R = \frac{1}{2} \times D = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{10}{\pi} \text{ meters} = \frac{5}{\pi} \text{ meters}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>

> [!NOTE] Pi (π) as a Number
> It is important to remember that [[explaining_the_significance_of_pi_in_circle_calculations | pi]] is a specific numerical value, approximately 3.14159... <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. While it's often left in its symbolic form for exactness and simplicity, it can be substituted with its numerical approximation for calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

The next steps in understanding circles often involve calculating their area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

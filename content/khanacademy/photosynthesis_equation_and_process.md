Photosynthesis is a fundamental biological process essential for life on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Without it, living organisms, including humans, would lack a primary source of food and oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This process allows plants, bacteria, and algae to harness sunlight energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Overview of Photosynthesis

In simple terms, [[Importance of Photosynthesis | photosynthesis]] is the process by which plants take carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight to produce [[Calvin Cycle and Carbohydrate Production | sugars]] or [[Calvin Cycle and Carbohydrate Production | carbohydrates]] and oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

The output of photosynthesis, [[Calvin Cycle and Carbohydrate Production | carbohydrates]], are vital for fueling bodies, as seen in cellular respiration where glucose (a broken-down carbohydrate) is used to generate ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The oxygen byproduct is also crucial for organisms that perform cellular respiration to break down glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

### The General Equation of Photosynthesis

The general [[Introduction to chemical equations | chemical equation]] for [[Importance of Photosynthesis | photosynthesis]] can be written as follows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>:

Carbon Dioxide + Water + Photons → Carbohydrate + Oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>

More specifically, using a general formula for [[Calvin Cycle and Carbohydrate Production | carbohydrates]] (`CH₂O` with an `n` multiple, where `n` is typically at least three and for glucose, `n` is 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>):

`n`CO₂ + `n`H₂O + Photons → (CH₂O)`n` + `n`O₂ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>

This equation represents the overall input of carbon dioxide, water, and photons, resulting in the production of a [[Calvin Cycle and Carbohydrate Production | carbohydrate]] and oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## Stages of Photosynthesis

Photosynthesis does not occur in a single direct step but through a series of stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. It is broadly divided into two main stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>:

### Light-Dependent Reactions

These reactions are also known as the [[Lightdependent and Lightindependent Reactions | light reactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
*   **Requirement**: They absolutely require sunlight (photons) to proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.
*   **Inputs**: Water and photons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
*   **Outputs**:
    *   Molecular Oxygen (O₂) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
    *   [[Role of ATP and NADPH in Photosynthesis | ATP]] (Adenosine Triphosphate), the cellular energy currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
    *   [[Role of ATP and NADPH in Photosynthesis | NADPH]] (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

[[Role of ATP and NADPH in Photosynthesis | NADPH]] is a crucial molecule that acts as a reducing agent, meaning it can donate a hydrogen atom and its associated electron to other molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. This transfer of electrons to a lower energy state releases energy that can be used in the subsequent [[Lightdependent and Lightindependent Reactions | dark reactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

### Light-Independent Reactions (Calvin Cycle)

These reactions are often mistakenly called "dark reactions," but they occur in the light as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. A more accurate term is [[Lightdependent and Lightindependent Reactions | light-independent reactions]] because they do not directly require photons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. They do, however, depend on the byproducts from the [[Lightdependent and Lightindependent Reactions | light-dependent reactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

*   **Common Name**: For most plants, this stage is known as the [[Calvin Cycle and Carbohydrate Production | Calvin Cycle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
*   **Inputs**:
    *   Carbon dioxide (CO₂) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.
    *   [[Role of ATP and NADPH in Photosynthesis | ATP]] from the light reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
    *   [[Role of ATP and NADPH in Photosynthesis | NADPH]] from the light reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
*   **Outputs**:
    *   The [[Calvin Cycle and Carbohydrate Production | Calvin Cycle]] uses carbon dioxide, [[Role of ATP and NADPH in Photosynthesis | ATP]], and [[Role of ATP and NADPH in Photosynthesis | NADPH]] to produce phosphoglyceraldehyde (PGAL) or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
    *   This PGAL/G3P is a simple building block that can be used to produce other [[Calvin Cycle and Carbohydrate Production | carbohydrates]], including [[chemical_equation_of_glucose | glucose]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. For example, two G3P molecules can combine to form [[chemical_equation_of_glucose | glucose]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

### Interconnectedness

The products of the [[Lightdependent and Lightindependent Reactions | light reactions]] (ATP and NADPH) directly fuel the [[Lightdependent and Lightindependent Reactions | light-independent reactions]], highlighting the integrated nature of photosynthesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. The G3P molecule produced in the [[Calvin Cycle and Carbohydrate Production | Calvin Cycle]] is notable as it is also the first product formed when [[chemical_equation_of_glucose | glucose]] is split during [[Glycolysis phases and process | glycolysis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. This illustrates how photosynthesis builds [[chemical_equation_of_glucose | glucose]] (or its precursors) that can later be broken down for energy.

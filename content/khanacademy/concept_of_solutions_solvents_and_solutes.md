The concepts of solutions, solvents, and solutes are fundamental in chemistry and biology, explaining how substances combine and interact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Defining the Components

Imagine a container filled with liquid water molecules, which are constantly moving and rubbing against each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. If sugar molecules are introduced into this water, they become interspersed among the water molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This scenario helps illustrate the definitions:

### Solvent
The **solvent** is the substance present in a greater quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. In the example of sugar dissolved in water, water is the solvent, as there are typically many more water molecules than sugar molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The solvent is the substance that "does the dissolving" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. While water is the most common solvent, especially in biological or chemical systems, other liquids like alcohol or mercury can also act as solvents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

### Solute
The **solute** is the substance present in a lesser quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. In the example, sugar is the solute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. It is the substance that "is dissolved" by the solvent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. The solute doesn't have to be sugar; it can be any molecule present in a smaller amount within the solvent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### Solution
A **solution** is the homogeneous mixture formed when a solute is dissolved into a solvent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. It comprises both the solvent and the solute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. For instance, the combination of water and sugar molecules after the sugar has dissolved is considered a sugar solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Related Concepts

### Concentration
[[role_of_concentration_gradients_in_diffusion_and_osmosis | Concentration]] refers to the amount of a specific particle per unit of space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. If there are many particles in a given space, it is a high [[role_of_concentration_gradients_in_diffusion_and_osmosis | concentration]]; if there are few, it is a low [[role_of_concentration_gradients_in_diffusion_and_osmosis | concentration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

Solutions can be described based on their relative [[role_of_concentration_gradients_in_diffusion_and_osmosis | concentration]] of solute:
*   **[[concept_of_hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | Hypertonic solution]]**: A solution with a high [[role_of_concentration_gradients_in_diffusion_and_osmosis | concentration]] of solute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   **[[concept_of_hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | Hypotonic solution]]**: A solution with a low [[role_of_concentration_gradients_in_diffusion_and_osmosis | concentration]] of solute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

### [[role_of_concentration_gradients_in_diffusion_and_osmosis | Diffusion]]
[[role_of_concentration_gradients_in_diffusion_and_osmosis | Diffusion]] is the process where particles or molecules spread out from an area of high [[role_of_concentration_gradients_in_diffusion_and_osmosis | concentration]] to an area of low [[role_of_concentration_gradients_in_diffusion_and_osmosis | concentration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. This spreading occurs due to the random movement and collisions of molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. For example, if sugar molecules are concentrated on one side of a container connected to a side with no sugar, the sugar molecules will naturally spread out until their [[role_of_concentration_gradients_in_diffusion_and_osmosis | concentration]] is roughly equal throughout the container <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

### [[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | Osmosis]]
[[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | Osmosis]] is a specific type of [[role_of_concentration_gradients_in_diffusion_and_osmosis | diffusion]] involving water (the solvent) across a [[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | semi-permeable membrane]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. A [[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | semi-permeable membrane]] allows water molecules to pass through but blocks larger solute molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

In [[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | osmosis]], water moves from an area of higher water [[role_of_concentration_gradients_in_diffusion_and_osmosis | concentration]] (or lower solute [[role_of_concentration_gradients_in_diffusion_and_osmosis | concentration]], i.e., [[concept_of_hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | hypotonic]]) to an area of lower water [[role_of_concentration_gradients_in_diffusion_and_osmosis | concentration]] (or higher solute [[role_of_concentration_gradients_in_diffusion_and_osmosis | concentration]], i.e., [[concept_of_hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | hypertonic]]) in an attempt to equalize the solute [[role_of_concentration_gradients_in_diffusion_and_osmosis | concentration]] on both sides of the membrane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. This net flow of water occurs because the solute molecules on the high [[role_of_concentration_gradients_in_diffusion_and_osmosis | concentration]] side physically hinder some water molecules from exiting, while water molecules from the low [[role_of_concentration_gradients_in_diffusion_and_osmosis | concentration]] side can freely enter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.

The concept of [[significant_figures_concept | significant figures]] (sometimes called [[significant_figures_concept | significant digits]]) aims to ensure that computational results do not over-represent the precision of the original measurements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. It helps determine which digits truly convey information about the precision of a measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Identifying Ambiguity

Certain numbers can be ambiguous in terms of their [[significant_figures_concept | significant digits]] if not written with explicit precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. This often occurs with whole numbers ending in zeros where a [[significance_of_decimal_points_in_measurements | decimal point]] is omitted.

Consider the number 37,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>:
*   It is unclear if the measurement was precisely 37,000, measured to the nearest one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   Alternatively, it might have only been measured to the nearest thousand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

Due to this lack of clarity, there is an inherent ambiguity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. If no additional information is provided, the general rule of thumb for [[identifying_significant_digits | identifying significant digits]] in such a number is to count only the non-zero digits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. Therefore, 37,000 would typically be considered to have two [[significant_figures_concept | significant figures]] (the 3 and the 7) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

## Resolving Ambiguity

To remove this ambiguity and indicate greater precision, a [[significance_of_decimal_points_in_measurements | decimal point]] can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. For example, writing 37,000. explicitly states that all digits, including the trailing zeros, are significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. In this case, 37,000. would have five [[significant_figures_concept | significant figures]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

If the [[significance_of_decimal_points_in_measurements | decimal point]] is not present, the number of [[significant_figures_concept | significant digits]] is typically assumed to be minimal (e.g., two for 37,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

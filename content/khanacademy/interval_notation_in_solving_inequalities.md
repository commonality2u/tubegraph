When [[solving_absolute_value_inequalities | solving inequalities]], especially those involving absolute values, solutions can be expressed using interval notation. This method describes the set of all possible values for the variable that satisfy the inequality.

## Understanding Interval Notation
Interval notation describes a range of numbers. For example, if a solution involves all numbers where `x` is greater than a specific value and less than another, this range can be represented using parentheses or brackets.

For the inequality `|x| < 12`, the absolute value signifies the distance of `x` from 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The solutions are all `x` values that are less than 12 units away from 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This means `x` must be greater than -12 and less than 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

In interval notation, this solution would be represented as `(-12, 12)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This means all numbers between -12 and 12, *not* including -12 or 12 themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

For a similar problem, where `|5x + 3| < 7`, the solution states that `x` must be greater than -2 and less than 4/5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. This can be written as `-2 < x < 4/5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. This range, representing all `x` values between -2 and 4/5, is also a form of interval notation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

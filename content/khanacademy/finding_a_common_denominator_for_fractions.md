To add or subtract fractions, it is essential that they share a [[finding_the_least_common_multiple | common denominator]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. The denominator is the bottom number in a fraction, while the numerator is the top number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## Fractions with the Same Denominator

When fractions already have the same denominator, adding or subtracting them is straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. The denominator remains the same, and only the numerators are added or subtracted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### Examples:

*   **Adding 1/4 + 1/4**
    Imagine a pie divided into four pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. If you eat 1/4 of the pie and then another 1/4, you have eaten 2 out of the 4 pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
    1/4 + 1/4 = 2/4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
    This fraction, 2/4, can be [[simplifying_fractions | simplified]] to 1/2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Adding 2/5 + 1/5**
    Since the denominators are the same (5), the denominator of the answer will also be 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. You simply add the numerators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
    2/5 + 1/5 = (2 + 1) / 5 = 3/5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Subtracting 3/7 - 2/7**
    Similar to addition, when subtracting fractions with the same denominator, subtract the numerators and keep the denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
    3/7 - 2/7 = (3 - 2) / 7 = 1/7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## Fractions with Different Denominators

When fractions have different denominators, you must first convert them so they share a [[finding_the_least_common_multiple | common denominator]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This involves rewriting one or both fractions as equivalent fractions with a new, shared denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

### Converting Fractions to a Common Denominator

To change a fraction's denominator while maintaining its value, you must multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the same number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. For example, multiplying a fraction by 2/2 (which is equal to 1) will change its appearance without altering its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

### Using the Least Common Multiple (LCM)

Often, the most efficient common denominator is the [[finding_the_least_common_multiple | least common multiple]] (LCM) of the original denominators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. The LCM is the smallest number that is a multiple of both original denominators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

### Examples:

*   **Adding 1/4 + 1/2**
    To add these, convert 1/2 into a fraction with a denominator of 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
    1/2 is equivalent to 2/4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. This is achieved by multiplying both the numerator (1) and the denominator (2) by 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
    So, 1/4 + 1/2 becomes 1/4 + 2/4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
    Adding the numerators: 1 + 2 = 3. Keep the denominator: 4.
    Result: 3/4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   **Adding 1/2 + 1/3**
    Neither 2 nor 3 can be directly multiplied by an integer to get the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. In this case, find the [[finding_the_least_common_multiple | least common multiple]] of 2 and 3, which is 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
    Convert both fractions to have a denominator of 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>:
    *   1/2 is equivalent to 3/6 (multiply numerator and denominator by 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
    *   1/3 is equivalent to 2/6 (multiply numerator and denominator by 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
    The problem becomes 3/6 + 2/6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
    Adding the numerators: 3 + 2 = 5. Keep the denominator: 6.
    Result: 5/6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   **Subtracting 1/2 - 1/3**
    Using the same common denominator (6) as in the addition example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>:
    1/2 - 1/3 becomes 3/6 - 2/6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
    Subtracting the numerators: 3 - 2 = 1. Keep the denominator: 6.
    Result: 1/6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
*   **Subtracting 1/10 - 1**
    To subtract a whole number from a fraction, express the whole number as a fraction with the same denominator as the other fraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
    1 can be written as 10/10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
    The problem becomes 1/10 - 10/10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
    Subtracting the numerators: 1 - 10 = -9. Keep the denominator: 10.
    Result: -9/10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   **Subtracting -1/9 - 1/4**
    Find the [[finding_the_least_common_multiple | least common multiple]] of 9 and 4, which is 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
    Convert both fractions to have a denominator of 36:
    *   -1/9 is equivalent to -4/36 (multiply numerator and denominator by 4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
    *   1/4 is equivalent to 9/36 (multiply numerator and denominator by 9) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
    The problem becomes -4/36 - 9/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
    Subtracting the numerators: -4 - 9 = -13. Keep the denominator: 36.
    Result: -13/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

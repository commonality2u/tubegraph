This article clarifies the distinctions between vectors and scalars, which are fundamental concepts in physics and mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Definitions

*   **Vector**: A quantity that possesses both a magnitude (size) and a direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   **Scalar**: A quantity that only has a magnitude (size) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

These concepts are often best understood through [[examples_of_vector_and_scalar_quantities | examples]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Scalar vs. Vector Quantities: Examples

### Distance vs. Displacement

Imagine moving a brick. If the brick is moved 5 meters from its original position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>:

*   **Distance (Scalar)**: Simply stating that the brick moved "5 meters" is a scalar quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This is because it only conveys the magnitude or size of the movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, without specifying the direction it moved (e.g., right, left, up, down) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. This specific scalar quantity is called **distance** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

*   **Displacement (Vector)**: If it's specified that the brick moved "5 meters to the right," this is a vector quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. It includes both the magnitude (5 meters) and the direction (to the right) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. This vector form of distance is known as **displacement** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

### Speed vs. Velocity

Consider the brick moving 5 meters in 2 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Time itself is considered to have only one direction for simple physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

*   **Speed (Scalar)**: If the brick travels 5 meters in 2 seconds, its rate of movement is 2.5 meters per second (5 meters / 2 seconds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. This value, "2.5 meters per second," is a scalar quantity because it tells you "how fast" (magnitude) but provides no information about the direction of travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. This scalar quantity is called **speed** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

*   **Velocity (Vector)**: If the brick travels 5 meters to the right in 2 seconds, its rate of movement is "2.5 meters per second to the right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. This is a vector quantity because it includes both the magnitude (2.5 meters per second) and the direction (to the right) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. When both speed and direction are specified, you are describing **velocity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

These examples illustrate the key distinction: vectors provide a complete picture of both size and orientation, while scalars only convey size.

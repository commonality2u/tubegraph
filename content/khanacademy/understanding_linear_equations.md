[[linear_equations | Linear equations]] are fundamental in algebra, representing a relationship where a variable is multiplied by a constant and set equal to another constant or expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. [[Solving simple linear equations | Solving simple linear equations]] typically involves isolating the variable.

## Basic Structure and Notation

A common form of a [[linear_equations | linear equation]] is a number multiplied by a variable, equaling another number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. For instance, `5x = 20` means "5 times question mark equals 20" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. In algebraic notation, when a number is written directly next to a variable (e.g., `5x`), it implies multiplication between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This convention avoids confusion with the variable `x` itself, which a traditional multiplication sign `x` might cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Another way to denote multiplication is with a dot (e.g., `5 â‹… x`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

The number multiplying the variable is called the **coefficient** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

## Methods for Solving Linear Equations

To solve a linear equation, the goal is to find the value of the variable. This is achieved by performing operations that isolate the variable on one side of the equation.

### 1. Division

One method is to divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of the variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   **Example**: `5x = 20`
    *   Divide both sides by 5: `(5x) / 5 = 20 / 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>
    *   This simplifies to `x = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>

### 2. Multiplication by the Reciprocal

Another method, which is mathematically equivalent to division, is to multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of the coefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Multiplying by a fraction's reciprocal is the same as dividing by that fraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This method is particularly useful when [[working_with_fractions_in_linear_equations | dealing with fractional coefficients]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

*   **Example**: `5x = 20`
    *   The reciprocal of 5 is 1/5.
    *   Multiply both sides by 1/5: `(1/5) * 5x = (1/5) * 20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>
    *   This simplifies to `x = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>

### Solving Equations with Fractions and Negative Numbers

When the coefficient is a fraction or a [[solving_linear_equations_involving_negative_numbers | negative number]], multiplying by the reciprocal is often the most straightforward approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

*   **Example**: `-3/4 x = 10/13` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>
    *   The reciprocal of -3/4 is -4/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
    *   Multiply both sides by -4/3: `(-4/3) * (-3/4 x) = (-4/3) * (10/13)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>
    *   On the left, the reciprocal and the coefficient cancel out, leaving `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
    *   On the right, multiply the numerators and denominators: `(10 * -4) / (13 * 3) = -40/39` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
    *   So, `x = -40/39` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Improper fractions are often preferred for ease of use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

## Checking Your Answer

A key advantage of algebra is the ability to verify solutions by substituting the calculated value of the variable back into the original equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

*   **Example (checking `x = -40/39` for `-3/4 x = 10/13`)**:
    *   Substitute `x` into the original equation: `-3/4 * (-40/39)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>
    *   Simplify the multiplication of fractions:
        *   Negative times negative equals positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
        *   Cross-cancel: 4 goes into -40 ten times (leaving 1 and 10), 3 goes into 39 thirteen times (leaving 1 and 13) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
        *   Result: `(3 * 10) / (1 * 39) = 30/39` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
    *   Simplify 30/39 by dividing both by 3: `10/13` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
    *   Since `10/13` matches the right side of the original equation, the answer is correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

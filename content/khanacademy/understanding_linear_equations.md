[[linear_equations_representation | Linear equations]] are fundamental in [[understanding_mathematical_equations | mathematics]], representing a relationship between variables that, when graphed, forms a straight line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Basic Notation and Interpretation
A common form of a [[linear_equations_representation | linear equation]] is demonstrated by `5x = 20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. At first glance, this might seem unfamiliar, but it can be rephrased as "5 times question mark equals 20" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

The notation where a number is written directly next to a variable (e.g., `5x`) signifies [[solving_linear_equations_using_division_and_multiplication | multiplication]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Thus, `5x` means "5 times x" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. In [[algebra]], different conventions for indicating [[solving_linear_equations_using_division_and_multiplication | multiplication]] exist to avoid confusion with the variable `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. These include:
*   Writing a number directly next to a variable (e.g., `5x`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>
*   Using a dot between two numbers (e.g., `4 * 3`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>
*   Writing a number next to parentheses (e.g., `5(-40/39)`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>

## [[solving_linear_equations | Solving Linear Equations]]
Many simple [[linear_equations_representation | linear equations]] can be solved mentally. For example, to solve `5x = 20`, one can ask "what number times 5 equals 20?", leading to the answer 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

For more complex numbers or systematic [[solving_linear_equations | solutions]], [[using_algebraic_steps_to_solve_equations | algebraic steps]] are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

### Systematic Approach
To [[solving_linear_equations | solve]] an [[understanding_mathematical_equations | equation]] like `5x = 20`, one can apply the following methods:

1.  **[[solving_linear_equations_using_division_and_multiplication | Dividing]] Both Sides:**
    Divide both sides of the [[understanding_mathematical_equations | equation]] by the coefficient of `x` (the number [[solving_linear_equations_using_division_and_multiplication | multiplied]] by `x`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
    ```
    5x = 20
    5x / 5 = 20 / 5
    x = 4
    ```
    The 5s on the left-hand side cancel out, leaving `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

2.  **[[solving_linear_equations_using_division_and_multiplication | Multiplying]] by the Reciprocal:**
    This is essentially the same as [[solving_linear_equations_using_division_and_multiplication | dividing]], but phrased differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Instead of [[solving_linear_equations_using_division_and_multiplication | dividing]] by 5, [[solving_linear_equations | multiply]] by its reciprocal, 1/5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
    ```
    5x = 20
    (1/5) * 5x = 20 * (1/5)
    x = 4
    ```
    [[solving_linear_equations_using_division_and_multiplication | Multiplying]] by the reciprocal is often preferred when dealing with fractional coefficients, as it simplifies the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### Examples of [[solving_linear_equations | Solving Linear Equations]] with Fractions

*   **Example 1:** Solve `(-3/4)x = 10/13` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>
    *   **Step 1:** [[solving_linear_equations_using_division_and_multiplication | Multiply]] both sides by the reciprocal of the coefficient of `x`, which is `-4/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
        ```
        (-4/3) * (-3/4)x = (10/13) * (-4/3)
        ```
    *   **Step 2:** Simplify both sides. On the left, `(-4/3)` and `(-3/4)` cancel out, leaving `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. On the right, [[solving_linear_equations_using_division_and_multiplication | multiply]] the numerators and denominators:
        ```
        x = (10 * -4) / (13 * 3)
        x = -40 / 39
        ```
    *   The solution can be left as an improper fraction, as it is often easier to work with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. This is equivalent to `-1 and 1/39` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

*   **Example 2:** Solve `(-5/6)x = 7/8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>
    *   **Step 1:** [[solving_linear_equations_using_division_and_multiplication | Multiply]] both sides by the reciprocal of `-5/6`, which is `-6/5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
        ```
        (-6/5) * (-5/6)x = (7/8) * (-6/5)
        ```
    *   **Step 2:** Simplify. The left side becomes `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. For the right side, simplify before [[solving_linear_equations_using_division_and_multiplication | multiplying]] by [[solving_linear_equations_using_division_and_multiplication | dividing]] 6 and 8 by 2:
        ```
        x = (7/8) * (-6/5)  ->  (7/4) * (-3/5)
        x = (7 * -3) / (4 * 5)
        x = -21 / 20
        ```

### Checking Your Answer
A powerful aspect of [[algebra]] is the ability to verify your [[solving_linear_equations | solution]] by substituting the calculated value of `x` back into the original [[understanding_mathematical_equations | equation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. If both sides of the [[understanding_mathematical_equations | equation]] are equal after substitution, your answer is correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

For instance, checking `x = -40/39` in `(-3/4)x = 10/13`:
```
(-3/4) * (-40/39) = 10/13
```
By cross-simplifying fractions (e.g., [[solving_linear_equations_using_division_and_multiplication | dividing]] 40 by 4 to get 10, and 4 by 4 to get 1; [[solving_linear_equations_using_division_and_multiplication | dividing]] 39 by 3 to get 13, and 3 by 3 to get 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, and noting that a negative times a negative is positive:
```
(-1/1) * (-10/13) = 10/13
10/13 = 10/13
```
Since both sides match, the solution is confirmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

Rational numbers are defined as any number that can be represented as the ratio of two integers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. There are infinitely many ways to represent a single rational number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Integers

All integers are rational numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

*   The number 1 can be represented as 1/1, -2/-2, or 10,000/10,000, among other ratios of two integers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   The number -7 can be represented as -7/1, 7/-1, or -14/2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Since it can be represented as the ratio of two integers, -7 is a rational number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Terminating Decimals

Numbers that are not integers, such as terminating decimals, can also be rational numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

*   For example, 3.75 can be rewritten as 375/100 or 750/200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   It can also be expressed as a mixed fraction, 3 and 3/4, which converts to the improper fraction 15/4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   Another representation is -30/-8, obtained by multiplying the numerator and denominator of 15/4 by -2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   Since 3.75 can be represented as the ratio of two integers, it is a rational number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

## [[repeating_decimals_as_rational_numbers | Repeating Decimals]]

[[repeating_decimals_as_rational_numbers | Repeating decimals]] are also rational numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

*   The repeating decimal 0.333... (denoted as 0.3 with a bar over the 3) is equivalent to 1/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   Similarly, 0.6 repeating is equivalent to 2/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   Any [[repeating_decimals_as_rational_numbers | repeating decimal]], even one with a million digits repeating, can always be represented as the ratio of two integers, as long as the pattern repeats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

## Contrast with Irrational Numbers

While integers, terminating decimals, and [[repeating_decimals_as_rational_numbers | repeating decimals]] cover a wide range of numbers that are rational, there are also numbers that are not rational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. These are called [[examples_and_definition_of_irrational_numbers | irrational numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

Some of the most famous numbers in mathematics are [[examples_and_definition_of_irrational_numbers | irrational numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>:

*   Pi (π): The ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. It never terminates and never repeats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   e (Euler's number): It never terminates and never repeats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   Square root of 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   Phi (Φ): The golden ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

[[characteristics_and_abundance_of_irrational_numbers | Irrational numbers]] are not uncommon; there is always at least one irrational number between any two rational numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. In fact, there is an infinite number of irrational numbers between any two rational numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Other characteristics of [[characteristics_and_abundance_of_irrational_numbers | irrational numbers]] include:

*   The square root of any non-perfect square is an [[examples_and_definition_of_irrational_numbers | irrational number]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   The sum of an [[examples_and_definition_of_irrational_numbers | irrational number]] and a rational number is always [[examples_and_definition_of_irrational_numbers | irrational]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   The product of an [[examples_and_definition_of_irrational_numbers | irrational number]] and a rational number is always [[examples_and_definition_of_irrational_numbers | irrational]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

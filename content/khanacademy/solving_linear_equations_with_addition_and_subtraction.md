This article explores how to [[solving_algebraic_equations|solve algebraic equations]] that involve a variable term and a constant term, using the principles of addition and subtraction. These equations are slightly more complex than basic linear equations, as they include an additional constant that needs to be isolated before [[solving_simple_linear_equations|solving for the variable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## The Core Principle: Maintaining Equality

When [[understanding_linear_equations|solving linear equations]], the fundamental rule is that any operation performed on one side of the equation must also be performed on the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:40">[01:38:40]</a>. This ensures that the equality between the two sides remains true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Method: Isolating the Variable Term

The first step in [[solving_simple_linear_equations|solving these equations]] is to isolate the term containing the variable (e.g., `3x` or `7x`). This is achieved by using addition or subtraction to eliminate the constant term on the same side of the equation as the variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### Example 1: `3x + 5 = 17`

Consider the equation `3x + 5 = 17` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The presence of the `+ 5` term makes it different from a simple `3x = 17` equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

#### Tangible Understanding
To understand this tangibly, `3x` can be thought of as three 'x' objects, and `+ 5` as five individual objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The equation states that these three 'x's plus five objects are equal to seventeen objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

To remove the five objects from the left side, you would literally take away five objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. To maintain equality, you must also take away five objects from the right side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

#### Symbolic Representation
Symbolically, "taking away five things" is represented by [[methods_for_solving_systems_of_equations|subtracting 5]] from both sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

```
3x + 5 = 17
3x + 5 - 5 = 17 - 5  <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>
```

On the left side, `5 - 5` cancels out, leaving only `3x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. On the right side, `17 - 5` equals `12` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

The equation simplifies to:
```
3x = 12  <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>
```

#### Solving for `x`
Once the constant term is removed, the equation becomes a simple multiplication problem. To [[solving_simple_linear_equations|solve for x]], divide both sides by the coefficient of `x` (in this case, 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

```
3x / 3 = 12 / 3  <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>
x = 4  <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>
```

### Example 2: `7x - 2 = -10`

This example introduces [[solving_linear_equations_involving_negative_numbers|negative numbers]] and subtraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

```
7x - 2 = -10  <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>
```

#### Eliminating the Constant Term
To get rid of the `- 2` on the left-hand side, you need to perform the opposite operation: [[methods_for_solving_systems_of_equations|add 2]] to both sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

```
7x - 2 + 2 = -10 + 2  <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>
```

On the left side, `-2 + 2` equals `0`, leaving `7x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
On the right side, [[solving_linear_equations_involving_negative_numbers|calculating with negative numbers]]: `-10 + 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Starting at -10 on a number line and moving 2 units in the positive direction results in -8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

The equation simplifies to:
```
7x = -8  <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>
```

#### Solving for `x`
Divide both sides by `7` to [[solving_simple_linear_equations|isolate x]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

```
7x / 7 = -8 / 7  <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>
x = -8/7  <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>
```

The answer can be left as an improper fraction or converted to a mixed number: `x = -1 and 1/7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

This demonstrates that the same principles of addition and subtraction apply when [[solving_linear_equations_involving_negative_numbers|working with negative numbers]] in linear equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

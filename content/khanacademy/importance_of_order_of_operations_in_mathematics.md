From: [[khanacademy]] <br/> 

The [[introduction_to_order_of_operations | order of operations]] is a fundamental concept in mathematics, crucial for maintaining consistency and accuracy in computations. A solid understanding of the [[introduction_to_order_of_operations | order of operations]] forms the basis for nearly all subsequent mathematical work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Why Order of Operations is Necessary

The primary purpose of the [[introduction_to_order_of_operations | order of operations]] is to ensure there is only one way to interpret a mathematical statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Without an [[agreed_upon_order_of_operations | agreed upon order of operations]], a single expression could yield multiple results, leading to confusion and errors.

### Example of Different Interpretations
Consider the expression `7 + 3 * 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Without an [[agreed_upon_order_of_operations | agreed upon order of operations]], there are two possible interpretations:
*   **Interpretation 1 (Left to Right)**: If read strictly from left to right, one might first calculate `7 + 3`, which is `10`, and then multiply by `5`, resulting in `50` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   **Interpretation 2 (Multiplication First)**: Another approach might prioritize multiplication before addition, calculating `3 * 5` first, which is `15`, and then adding `7`, resulting in `22` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

These [[examples_of_different_interpretations_without_a_set_order_of_operations | different interpretations]] of the same statement highlight the problem: two different answers from the same problem is "not cool in mathematics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### Real-World [[importance_in_computations | Importance]]
The ambiguity caused by a lack of an [[agreed_upon_order_of_operations | agreed upon order of operations]] has serious implications. If a calculation for a space mission, for example, were interpreted differently by two people or two computers, it could lead to catastrophic failure, such as a satellite veering off course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This makes an [[agreed_upon_order_of_operations | agreed upon order]] "completely unacceptable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, necessitating a universal standard.

## The Agreed-Upon Order

To prevent such issues, mathematicians have established an [[agreed_upon_order_of_operations | agreed upon order of operations]]:
1.  **Parentheses** (or other grouping symbols) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>
2.  **Exponents** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>
3.  **Multiplication and Division** (from left to right) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>
4.  **Addition and Subtraction** (from left to right) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>

Following this specific sequence ensures that everyone arrives at the same answer for a given mathematical statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

### Applying the Order to Resolve Ambiguity
Revisiting `7 + 3 * 5`:
*   According to the [[agreed_upon_order_of_operations | order of operations]], multiplication takes priority over addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   First, calculate `3 * 5 = 15` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   Then, add `7 + 15 = 22` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
Thus, `22` is the single correct interpretation of the expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This demonstrates the [[solving_arithmetic_expressions_using_order_of_operations | solving arithmetic expressions using order of operations]] process.

### Handling Operations at the Same Level
When multiple operations of the same priority level appear (e.g., multiplication and division, or addition and subtraction), they are performed from left to right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

For example, `10 * 4 / 2`:
*   Multiplication and division are at the same level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   Perform `10 * 4 = 40` first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   Then `40 / 2 = 20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

Similarly, for `1 + 2 - 3 + 4 - 1`:
*   Addition and subtraction are at the same level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   Perform `1 + 2 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   Then `3 - 3 = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   Then `0 + 4 = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   Finally `4 - 1 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

### Exceptions to Left-to-Right Rule
The strict left-to-right rule can be relaxed only when an expression consists solely of *all addition* or *all multiplication* operations. In such cases, the order of operations does not affect the final result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. For example, `1 + 5 + 7 + 3 + 2` can be calculated in any order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. However, if any division or subtraction is introduced, adhering to the left-to-right rule within the same priority level is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

No one is born smart; everyone begins at zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Initially, individuals cannot talk, walk, or even do [[origins_of_algebra|algebra]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The ability to do things like adding, reading, writing, or riding a bike are all learned skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Nobody is inherently good at anything from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

### Greats Started Small

Even historical figures who achieved greatness began with basic learning:
*   There was a period when Einstein couldn't count to ten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   Shakespeare, like everyone else, had to learn his ABCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

### The Universal Journey of Learning

Fortunately, humans are innately wired to learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Learning is a process that involves stumbling, slipping, crawling, falling, and [[overcoming_failure|failing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This often includes frustrating and confusing struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. However, each incorrect answer contributes to strengthening the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. In essence, [[overcoming_failure|failing]] is simply another way of describing growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

This continuous progression is what defines learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. It's knowing that success will eventually be achieved, even if it hasn't happened yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The most intricate and beautiful concepts in the universe are built upon foundational ideas that anyone, anywhere, can grasp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Regardless of who or where you are, the key takeaway is that you are capable of learning anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

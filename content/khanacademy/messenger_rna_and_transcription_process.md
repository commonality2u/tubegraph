[[DNA structure and replication | DNA's structure]] as a double helix makes it suitable as the molecular basis of heredity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. For an organism's genetic material to be passed on and utilized, it must be replicable and expressible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## DNA, Chromosomes, and Genes

It is important to distinguish between DNA, chromosomes, and genes:
*   **DNA** refers to the molecule itself, characterized by its sugar-phosphate backbone and sequence of base pairs in a double helix structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. A DNA molecule can be tens of millions of base pairs long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   A **chromosome** is a DNA molecule packaged together with other molecules and proteins, forming a broader structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   A **gene** is a specific section of DNA that codes for a certain type of protein, thereby defining a particular trait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Genes can vary greatly in length, from several thousand to millions of base pairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

## Gene Expression and the Role of RNA

The information stored in [[dna_and_cell_function | DNA]] is expressed primarily through the creation of proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. This process involves another crucial molecule related to DNA: [[role_of_rna_in_genetic_processes | RNA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

[[role_of_rna_in_genetic_processes | RNA]] stands for ribonucleic acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. Unlike DNA, which is deoxyribonucleic acid, RNA has a sugar backbone that is slightly different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. In cells with nuclei, DNA generally remains within the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. To be expressed, the information must largely get outside the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. This is where [[role_of_rna_in_genetic_processes | RNA]], specifically messenger RNA (mRNA), plays a vital role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. mRNA acts as a messenger, carrying genetic information from a section of DNA out of the nucleus so it can be translated into an actual protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

## Transcription: DNA to mRNA

The first step in [[gene_expression_and_transcription | gene expression]], the process of going from DNA to mRNA, is called **transcription** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

During transcription, a section of the DNA molecule (corresponding to a gene) serves as a template to construct a complementary strand of messenger RNA (mRNA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. This process is conceptually similar to DNA replication, where a new strand is built based on an existing one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

Key differences in base pairing for RNA synthesis:
*   In RNA, adenine (A) pairs with uracil (U), not thymine (T) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. DNA contains thymine, while RNA contains uracil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   Thymine (T) on the DNA template still pairs with adenine (A) in the new RNA strand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
*   Guanine (G) still pairs with cytosine (C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.
*   Cytosine (C) still pairs with guanine (G) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

Once the mRNA strand is constructed, it detaches from the DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>, becoming a single strand of messenger RNA that carries all the genetic information from that particular section of DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

## From mRNA to Protein: Translation

After transcription, the mRNA molecule can leave the nucleus and attach to a [[protein_synthesis_and_ribosomes | ribosome]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. The next process, called **translation**, uses this mRNA code to create proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. This involves converting the base pair sequence into an amino acid sequence, as proteins are made up of sequences of amino acids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

In [[translation_and_protein_synthesis | translation]], each sequence of three bases on the mRNA, known as a **codon**, codes for a specific amino acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. With four possible bases in RNA (A, U, C, G) and three positions in a codon, there are 4 x 4 x 4 = 64 possible codons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. Since there are 20 possible amino acids, multiple codons can code for the same amino acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules are responsible for bringing the correct amino acids to the ribosome to match the codons on the mRNA, thereby constructing a sequence of amino acids that forms a protein <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. Proteins are the essential molecules that carry out most of the work in living organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.

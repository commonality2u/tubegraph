The [[kidney_anatomy_and_function | kidney]] is an organ primarily known for producing or allowing the excretion of waste, but it also helps maintain water levels, the amount of salts or electrolytes, and blood pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The smallest functional level at which the [[kidney_anatomy_and_function | kidney]] operates is the nephron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Kidney Overview and Nephron Location
Most individuals have two [[kidney_anatomy_and_function | kidneys]], located closer to the back, on either side of the spine, behind the liver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. When a [[kidney_anatomy_and_function | kidney]] is sliced to reveal its internal structure, two main regions are visible:
*   **Renal Cortex**: The outer part of the [[kidney_anatomy_and_function | kidney]], extending from the outer edge to the border with the medulla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. The term "renal" always refers to the [[kidney_anatomy_and_function | kidney]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Renal Medulla**: The inner part, meaning "middle of the [[kidney_anatomy_and_function | kidney]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

These regions play a vital role in [[filtration_in_the_kidney | filtration]] and waste excretion, as well as the ability to retain water during blood filtering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

The nephron is considered the functional unit of the [[kidney_anatomy_and_function | kidney]] because it is at this level that the two major functions occur: waste excretion and the maintenance of water levels in the blood system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. A single [[kidney_anatomy_and_function | kidney]] typically contains about one million nephrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Nephrons are super thin tubes or tubules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. They begin in the renal cortex, dip down into the renal medulla, and then return to the cortex before ultimately dumping fluid into collecting ducts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

## Components of the Nephron

The process of blood [[filtration_in_the_kidney | filtration]] and the reabsorption of essential substances occurs through several distinct parts of the nephron:

### 1. Afferent Arteriole
Blood enters the nephron structure via the afferent arteriole, which is an arterial capillary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. This vessel carries oxygenated blood and maintains high blood pressure, which is crucial for squeezing fluid and dissolved substances out of the blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

### 2. Glomerulus
The afferent arteriole branches into a "big windy place" called the glomerulus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. The glomerulus is a very porous network of capillaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. After passing through the glomerulus, blood leaves via the efferent arteriole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

### 3. Bowman's Capsule and Bowman's Space
The glomerulus is surrounded by the Bowman's capsule, a spherical structure with an opening where the capillary system winds around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Cells called podocytes line the Bowman's capsule and are selective about what gets filtered out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

About one-fifth of the fluid entering the glomerulus is filtered into the Bowman's space, which is the space inside the Bowman's capsule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. This fluid, called filtrate, is not yet urine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. The filtrate primarily consists of water and small molecules like ions (sodium), glucose, and amino acids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Larger molecules such as red blood cells or large proteins are not filtered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

### 4. Proximal Tubule (Proximal Convoluted Tubule)
Following the Bowman's capsule, the filtrate enters the proximal tubule, also known as the proximal convoluted tubule due to its curvy, convoluted shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. "Proximal" means "near," indicating its proximity to the beginning of the nephron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

The primary function of the proximal tubule is to begin [[reabsorption_process_in_the_nephron | reabsorbing]] substances that the body needs back from the filtrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. This includes valuable substances like glucose, sodium, amino acids, and some water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. This [[reabsorption_process_in_the_nephron | reabsorption]] is an active process, meaning it uses ATP (energy) to pump substances like sodium out, which in turn helps bring in other essential molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

### 5. [[loop_of_henle_mechanisms | Loop of Henle]]
The filtrate then enters the [[loop_of_henle_mechanisms | Loop of Henle]], which is often considered the most interesting part of the nephron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. This long, U-shaped tube dips deeply into the renal medulla and then ascends back towards the cortex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

The [[loop_of_henle_mechanisms | Loop of Henle]] has two main functions:
*   **Making the Renal Medulla Salty (Hypertonic)**: The ascending part of the [[loop_of_henle_mechanisms | Loop of Henle]] actively pumps out salts (sodium, potassium, chloride ions) into the surrounding renal medulla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. This process makes the medulla hypertonic, meaning it has a higher concentration of solutes (salts) compared to the filtrate within the tubule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. This active pumping requires ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. The ascending part is permeable to these salts but not to water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.
*   **Water [[reabsorption_process_in_the_nephron | Reabsorption]]**: The descending part of the [[loop_of_henle_mechanisms | Loop of Henle]] is permeable only to water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. As the filtrate moves down into the salty (hypertonic) medulla, water naturally leaves the tubule via [[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | osmosis]], moving from an area of lower solute concentration to an area of higher solute concentration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. This is a major mechanism for reclaiming a significant amount of water that was initially filtered out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. Biological systems cannot actively pump water, so making the environment salty facilitates passive water movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>. The length of the [[loop_of_henle_mechanisms | Loop of Henle]] allows sufficient time for this water secretion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

### 6. Distal Tubule (Distal Convoluted Tubule)
After the [[loop_of_henle_mechanisms | Loop of Henle]], the filtrate enters another convoluted tubule known as the distal convoluted tubule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. "Distal" means "further away," as it is further from the beginning of the nephron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. In this section, more [[reabsorption_process_in_the_nephron | reabsorption]] occurs, including calcium, more sodium, and additional water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.

### 7. Collecting Duct
The processed filtrate, now much more concentrated with waste products and less water, is dumped into collecting ducts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>. Multiple nephrons connect to a single collecting duct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.

The collecting duct also extends back into the salty renal medulla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>. The permeability of the collecting duct to water can be regulated by hormones, such as antidiuretic hormone (ADH) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. If the duct is made more porous, more water will leave due to the salty medulla, making the final fluid (now called urine) even more concentrated and reducing water loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.

Once the fluid has been collected and further concentrated, it leaves the [[kidney_anatomy_and_function | kidney]] via the ureters and travels to the urinary bladder for excretion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>.

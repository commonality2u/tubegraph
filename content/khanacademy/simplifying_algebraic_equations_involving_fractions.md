## Introduction to Level One Linear Equations

A basic linear equation might appear as `5x = 20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This notation means "5 multiplied by some unknown number `x` equals 20" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. In algebra, when a number is written directly next to a variable, it is assumed to be multiplied by that variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

While many can solve `5x = 20` mentally (the answer is 4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, a systematic approach is necessary for more complex numbers or fractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

### Systematic Solution Methods

To solve `5x = 20` systematically:
1.  **Divide both sides by the coefficient**: You can divide both sides of the equation by 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
    *   `5x / 5 = 20 / 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>
    *   `x = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>
2.  **Multiply both sides by the reciprocal**: This is essentially the same as dividing, but phrased differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Instead of dividing by 5, you can [[multiplying_fractions | multiply by]] 1/5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
    *   `(1/5) * 5x = (1/5) * 20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>
    *   `x = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>
    This method is often preferred when dealing with fractional coefficients because it simplifies the thought process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Solving Equations with Fractional Coefficients

Consider a more complex equation like `(-3/4)x = 10/13` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. To solve this, you still perform the same fundamental operation: multiply both sides by the reciprocal of the coefficient on `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. The *coefficient* is the number being multiplied by the variable `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

### Example: `(-3/4)x = 10/13`

1.  **Identify the coefficient**: The coefficient of `x` is -3/4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
2.  **Find the reciprocal**: The reciprocal of -3/4 is -4/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
    *   *Note on multiplication signs*: In algebra, a dot `â€¢` or parentheses `()` can signify multiplication to avoid confusion with the variable `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
3.  **Multiply both sides by the reciprocal**:
    *   `(-4/3) * (-3/4)x = (-4/3) * (10/13)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>
4.  **Simplify**:
    *   On the left side, the reciprocal and the coefficient cancel out to 1, leaving `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
    *   On the right side, [[multiplying_fractions | multiply the fractions]]:
        *   Numerator: 10 * (-4) = -40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>
        *   Denominator: 13 * 3 = 39 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>
    *   Result: `x = -40/39` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>
    It is often easier to leave fractions as improper fractions rather than converting them to mixed numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

### Checking the Answer

A valuable aspect of algebra is the ability to check your answer by substituting it back into the original equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

For the equation `(-3/4)x = 10/13` and the solution `x = -40/39`:
1.  Substitute `x`: `(-3/4) * (-40/39)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>
2.  [[Multiplying fractions | Multiply the fractions]]:
    *   Before multiplying, you can [[simplifying_fractions | simplify diagonally]]. For example, 4 goes into 40 ten times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
    *   `(-3/4) * (-40/39) = (-3/1) * (-10/39)` (after simplifying 4 and 40) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>
    *   A negative multiplied by a negative results in a positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
    *   `(3 * 10) / (1 * 39) = 30/39` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>
3.  [[Simplifying fractions to lowest terms | Simplify the resulting fraction]]: Divide both the numerator and denominator by 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
    *   `30/39 = 10/13` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>
Since 10/13 matches the right-hand side of the original equation, the solution is correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

### Another Example: `(-5/6)x = 7/8`

1.  **Identify the coefficient**: -5/6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
2.  **Find the reciprocal**: -6/5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
3.  **Multiply both sides by the reciprocal**:
    *   `(-6/5) * (-5/6)x = (-6/5) * (7/8)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>
4.  **Simplify**:
    *   Left side becomes `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
    *   Right side: [[multiplying_fractions | multiply]] and [[simplifying_fractional_representations | simplify]] (e.g., divide 6 and 8 by 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
        *   `(-3/5) * (7/4)` (after simplifying 6 and 8) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>
        *   Numerator: -3 * 7 = -21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>
        *   Denominator: 5 * 4 = 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>
    *   Result: `x = -21/20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>
5.  **Check (optional but recommended)**:
    *   `(-5/6) * (-21/20)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>
    *   [[Simplifying fractions | Simplify]]: 5 and 20 (to 1 and 4), 6 and 21 (to 2 and 7) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
    *   `(-1/2) * (-7/4)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>
    *   A negative times a negative is positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
    *   `(1 * 7) / (2 * 4) = 7/8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>
The answer is correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

The Krebs cycle, also known as the citric acid cycle, is a crucial metabolic pathway in cellular respiration that further breaks down glucose derivatives to produce energy carriers. It follows [[Overview of glycolysis | glycolysis]] and occurs within the mitochondria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

## Location in the Cell
The Krebs cycle takes place within the inner space, or matrix, of the mitochondria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. Mitochondria have an outer membrane and a convoluted inner membrane known as cristae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. The space inside the inner membrane is called the matrix, while the space between the outer and inner membranes is the outer compartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.

## Pyruvate Oxidation: The Preparatory Step
Before entering the Krebs cycle, the 3-carbon [[production_of_pyruvate_and_its_importance | pyruvate]] molecules, which are the end products of [[Overview of glycolysis | glycolysis]], undergo a preparatory step called [[production_of_pyruvate_and_its_importance | pyruvate]] oxidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.
*   During this process, one carbon is cleaved off each [[production_of_pyruvate_and_its_importance | pyruvate]] molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. This carbon is released as carbon dioxide (CO2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.
*   The remaining 2-carbon compound is called acetyl-CoA (acetyl coenzyme A) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.
*   This step also reduces NAD+ to NADH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.
*   Since [[Overview of glycolysis | glycolysis]] produces two [[production_of_pyruvate_and_its_importance | pyruvates]] from one glucose molecule, this preparatory step occurs twice, yielding two NADHs per glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>.

## The Cycle Mechanism
The Krebs cycle itself begins when acetyl-CoA, a 2-carbon compound, merges with oxaloacetic acid, a 4-carbon molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>.
*   This reaction forms citrate, or citric acid, which is a 6-carbon molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.
*   Citric acid is then oxidized over a series of steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>. Two carbons are cleaved off during this oxidation, returning the molecule to oxaloacetic acid, which can then re-enter the cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>. These cleaved carbons are released as CO2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>.
*   All steps in the Krebs cycle are catalyzed by enzymes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.

## Energy Outputs of the Krebs Cycle

The primary function of the Krebs cycle is to generate electron carriers (NADH and FADH2) and some direct [[atp_production_through_cellular_respiration | ATP production]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>.

### Per Turn (Per Pyruvate)
For each molecule of [[production_of_pyruvate_and_its_importance | pyruvate]] (or acetyl-CoA) that enters the cycle, the following are produced:
*   3 NADH molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a>
*   1 [[atp_production_through_cellular_respiration | ATP]] molecule (sometimes initially as GTP, which can then be used to form [[atp_production_through_cellular_respiration | ATP]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:00">[16:51:00]</a>
*   1 FADH2 molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>

### Per Glucose Molecule
Since one glucose molecule produces two [[production_of_pyruvate_and_its_importance | pyruvates]] via [[Overview of glycolysis | glycolysis]], the Krebs cycle runs twice for each glucose molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>. Considering both [[production_of_pyruvate_and_its_importance | pyruvate]] oxidation and the Krebs cycle:

| Product      | Per Pyruvate (1 turn) | Per Glucose (2 turns) |
| :----------- | :-------------------- | :-------------------- |
| NADH         | 1 (pyruvate oxidation) + 3 (Krebs) = 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a> | 8 (2 from pyruvate oxidation, 6 from Krebs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a> |
| [[atp_production_through_cellular_respiration | ATP]]          | 1                     | 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:19:00">[11:19:00]</a>     |
| FADH2        | 1                     | 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:00">[11:29:00]</a>     |
| CO2          | 1 (pyruvate oxidation) + 2 (Krebs) = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a> | 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>     |

Overall, for one glucose molecule, the combination of [[production_of_pyruvate_and_its_importance | pyruvate]] oxidation and the Krebs cycle yields 8 NADHs, 2 FADH2s, and 2 ATPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a>.

### Role of NADH and FADH2
While the Krebs cycle directly produces a small amount of [[atp_production_through_cellular_respiration | ATP]], its main contribution to cellular energy lies in the generation of NADH and FADH2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>. These molecules are crucial inputs for the electron transport chain, where the bulk of [[atp_production_through_cellular_respiration | ATP production]] occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>.
*   Each NADH yields approximately 3 ATPs in the electron transport chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>.
*   Each FADH2 yields approximately 2 ATPs in the electron transport chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>.

From one glucose molecule, the 10 total NADHs (2 from [[Overview of glycolysis | glycolysis]] + 8 from [[production_of_pyruvate_and_its_importance | pyruvate]] oxidation/Krebs) lead to ~30 ATPs, and the 2 FADH2s lead to ~4 ATPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:00">[13:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:00">[13:19:00]</a>. When combined with the 4 direct ATPs from [[Overview of glycolysis | glycolysis]] and the Krebs cycle, this sums up to a theoretical maximum of 38 ATPs per glucose molecule in a highly efficient cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:00">[13:42:00]</a>.

## The Krebs Cycle as a Metabolic Hub
The Krebs cycle is not exclusively for carbohydrate metabolism. It serves as a general catabolic intermediary for other macromolecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:00">[15:01:00]</a>.
*   **Proteins** can be broken down into amino acids, which can then be converted into acetyl-CoA and enter the Krebs cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:51:00">[14:51:00]</a>.
*   **Fats** can be turned into glucose (in the liver) or directly into acetyl-CoA, allowing them to enter the Krebs cycle for energy production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>.

This means that regardless of whether the body's fuel source is carbohydrates, proteins, or fats, acetyl-CoA is the common entry point into the Krebs cycle for [[atp_production_through_cellular_respiration | ATP production]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:00">[15:01:00]</a>.

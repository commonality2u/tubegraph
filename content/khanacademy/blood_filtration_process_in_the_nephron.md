The [[kidney_overview_and_function | kidney]] is an organ primarily known for producing and excreting waste products. Beyond waste excretion, it also helps maintain proper water levels, regulates salt or electrolyte balance, and influences blood pressure. Additionally, the [[kidney_overview_and_function | kidney]] produces hormones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Humans typically have two [[kidney_overview_and_function | kidneys]], located closer to the back on either side of the spine, behind the liver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

### Internal Structure of the Kidney
To understand the [[kidney_overview_and_function | kidney]]'s function, it's important to differentiate its internal parts:
*   **[[role_of_the_renal_cortex_and_medulla | Renal Cortex]]** The outer part of the [[kidney_overview_and_function | kidney]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   **[[role_of_the_renal_cortex_and_medulla | Renal Medulla]]** The inner part of the [[kidney_overview_and_function | kidney]], derived from the word "middle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

Both the [[role_of_the_renal_cortex_and_medulla | renal cortex]] and [[role_of_the_renal_cortex_and_medulla | renal medulla]] play crucial roles in the filtration process, waste excretion, and the ability to conserve water during blood filtration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

### The [[Nephron structure and function | Nephron]]: Functional Unit of the Kidney
The [[nephron_structure_and_function | nephron]] is considered the smallest functional unit of the [[kidney_overview_and_function | kidney]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. It is at this level that the two primary functions of the [[kidney_overview_and_function | kidney]] — waste excretion and the maintenance of water levels in the blood — occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

Each [[kidney_overview_and_function | kidney]] contains approximately one million [[nephron_structure_and_function | nephrons]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. These [[nephron_structure_and_function | nephrons]] are composed of super thin tubes or tubules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. A [[nephron_structure_and_function | nephron]] begins in the [[role_of_the_renal_cortex_and_medulla | renal cortex]], dips down into the [[role_of_the_renal_cortex_and_medulla | medulla]], returns to the [[role_of_the_renal_cortex_and_medulla | cortex]], and then drains into collecting ducts, which eventually lead to the ureters and the urinary bladder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

### Blood Filtration Process within the [[Nephron structure and function | Nephron]]
The complex process of blood filtration within the [[nephron_structure_and_function | nephron]] involves several key stages:

#### 1. Glomerular Filtration
Blood enters the [[nephron_structure_and_function | nephron]] via the afferent arteriole, which is an arterial capillary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This blood is still oxygenated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Arterial systems typically have higher blood pressure, which is essential for squeezing fluid and dissolved substances out of the blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

The blood then enters the [[nephron_structure_and_function | glomerulus]], a "windy" network of capillaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. The [[nephron_structure_and_function | glomerulus]] is highly porous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Surrounding the [[nephron_structure_and_function | glomerulus]] is the [[nephron_structure_and_function | Bowman's capsule]], a spherical structure with an opening where the capillaries wind around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. Specialized cells called podocytes, which line the [[nephron_structure_and_function | Bowman's capsule]], make the filtration process more selective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

About one-fifth of the fluid entering the [[nephron_structure_and_function | glomerulus]] is filtered into the [[nephron_structure_and_function | Bowman's space]] (the space within the [[nephron_structure_and_function | Bowman's capsule]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. This filtered fluid is called filtrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. The filtrate contains small ions, such as sodium, as well as small molecules like glucose and amino acids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Larger molecules like red blood cells and large proteins are not filtered out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. Blood then leaves the [[nephron_structure_and_function | glomerulus]] via the efferent arteriole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

#### 2. Reabsorption in the Proximal Tubule
Following filtration, the filtrate enters the proximal tubule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. "Proximal" means near, indicating its proximity to the beginning of the [[nephron_structure_and_function | nephron]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. This tubule is highly convoluted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

The main purpose of the proximal tubule is to reabsorb essential substances from the filtrate that the body needs to keep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. These include glucose (important for energy), sodium (a useful ion), and amino acids (building blocks for proteins) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Reabsorption is an active process, meaning it requires energy in the form of ATP to pump substances like sodium out of the tubule and back into the bloodstream, which is facilitated by an adjacent capillary system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. Some water is also reabsorbed here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a> to prevent the excretion of excessive amounts of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

#### 3. The Loop of Henle and Water Conservation
The filtrate then moves into the loop of Henle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. This segment of the [[nephron_structure_and_function | nephron]] is quite long and dips down into the [[role_of_the_renal_cortex_and_medulla | renal medulla]] and then ascends back into the [[role_of_the_renal_cortex_and_medulla | cortex]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. This deep penetration into the [[role_of_the_renal_cortex_and_medulla | medulla]] is critical for water conservation.

The loop of Henle has two main parts:
*   **Ascending Limb**: This part actively pumps out salts, including sodium, potassium, and chloride ions, into the surrounding [[role_of_the_renal_cortex_and_medulla | renal medulla]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. This process makes the [[role_of_the_renal_cortex_and_medulla | medulla]] very salty or [[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | hypertonic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. The ascending limb is permeable to these salts but impermeable to water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. Active pumping against a concentration gradient requires ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.
*   **Descending Limb**: This part is permeable only to water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. As the filtrate moves down the descending limb into the salty ([[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | hypertonic]]) [[role_of_the_renal_cortex_and_medulla | medulla]], water naturally leaves the tubule via [[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | osmosis]] to balance concentrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. This is a major mechanism for [[water_and_solute_reabsorption_in_the_nephron | water reabsorption]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. Biological systems can actively pump ions using ATP, but not water, so creating a salty environment for water to naturally flow out is an efficient solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

#### 4. Reabsorption in the Distal Tubule and Collecting Duct
After the loop of Henle, the filtrate enters the distal convoluted tubule, which is "distal" meaning further away from the beginning of the [[nephron_structure_and_function | nephron]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. Here, more reabsorption of substances like calcium and sodium occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. Some additional water is also reabsorbed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>.

Finally, the processed filtrate, now much more concentrated and containing mainly waste products and excess water, is dumped into collecting ducts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>. Multiple [[nephron_structure_and_function | nephrons]] drain into a single collecting duct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. The collecting duct also passes back through the salty [[role_of_the_renal_cortex_and_medulla | renal medulla]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>. The porosity of the collecting duct can be regulated by hormones like anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. If made very porous, more water will leave the duct due to the [[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | hypertonic]] medulla, making the final urine even more concentrated and minimizing water loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. The urine then leaves the [[kidney_overview_and_function | kidney]] via the ureters and travels to the urinary bladder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>.

A multiple of a number is the result of multiplying that number by an integer. For example, 36 is a multiple of 12 because 12 multiplied by 3 equals 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Similarly, 36 is a multiple of 36 (1 times 36) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Least Common Multiple (LCM)

The [[least_common_multiple | least common multiple]] (LCM) of two or more numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of all of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. It is often denoted as LCM(a, b) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

### Examples of Finding the LCM

**LCM of 36 and 12**
In this case, 36 is already a multiple of 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Since 36 is also a multiple of itself, the [[least_common_multiple | least common multiple]] of 36 and 12 is 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

**LCM of 18 and 12**
To find the [[least_common_multiple | least common multiple]] of 18 and 12, there are two primary approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

#### 1. Prime Factorization Approach

This method involves finding the prime factorization of each number and then constructing the smallest number that contains all the prime factors of both numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

*   **Prime Factorization of 18:**
    *   18 can be broken down as 2 times 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
    *   9 can be broken down as 3 times 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
    *   So, 18 = 2 × 3 × 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **Prime Factorization of 12:**
    *   12 can be broken down as 2 times 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
    *   6 can be broken down as 2 times 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
    *   So, 12 = 2 × 2 × 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

*   **Constructing the LCM:**
    *   The LCM must contain all prime factors of 18: 2 × 3 × 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
    *   Now, check the prime factors of 12 (2 × 2 × 3):
        *   One '3' is already present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
        *   One '2' is already present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
        *   Another '2' is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
    *   Add the missing '2' to the LCM construction: 2 × 3 × 3 × 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
    *   Calculate the result: 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 = 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
    *   Thus, the [[least_common_multiple | least common multiple]] of 18 and 12 is 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

#### 2. Listing [[multiplication_as_repeated_addition | Multiples]] (Brute Force) Approach

This method involves listing out the [[multiplication_as_repeated_addition | multiples]] for each number until a common one is found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

*   **[[multiplication_as_repeated_addition | Multiples]] of 18:** 18, 36, 54... <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>
*   **[[multiplication_as_repeated_addition | Multiples]] of 12:** 12, 24, 36... <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>

The smallest common multiple found is 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

### Choosing a Method

While the listing method can be quick for smaller numbers, the prime factorization method is generally more systematic and effective for larger or more complex numbers, where listing all [[multiplication_as_repeated_addition | multiples]] could become tedious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

The [[slope_of_a_straight_line | slope of a line]] indicates its steepness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. It is defined as the [[finding_slope_between_two_points | change in y]] divided by the [[finding_slope_between_two_points | change in x]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. For any given straight line, its slope will always remain constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

The formula for slope (m) is:
$$m = \frac{\text{Change in y}}{\text{Change in x}}$$
This can also be written using the capital Greek letter delta (Δ), which signifies "change in":
$$m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>

## Calculating Slope from a Graph

To find the slope of a line from a graph, one can pick any two points on the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. It is often easiest to select points with integer coordinates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

### Method 1: Positive Changes

Consider a line where two points can be identified.
Let's choose a starting point and a second point to its right and up.

1.  **Calculate Change in x (Δx)**: Count the horizontal steps from the starting point to the second point.
    *   If moving from x = -3 to x = 0, the change in x is 3 units (1, 2, 3 steps) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. So, Δx = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
2.  **Calculate Change in y (Δy)**: Count the vertical steps from the starting point to the second point.
    *   If moving from y = -3 to y = -1, the change in y is 2 units (1, 2 steps) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. So, Δy = 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
3.  **Determine the Slope**:
    *   Slope = Δy / Δx = 2 / 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

### Method 2: Negative Changes (and different points)

The slope remains the same regardless of which two points are chosen or the direction of calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Let's use two different points and calculate the change in a different direction.

Consider a different starting point and a second point to its left and down.

1.  **Calculate Change in y (Δy)**: Count the vertical steps from the starting point to the second point.
    *   If moving from y = 1 to y = -3, the change in y is -4 units (going down 4 steps) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. So, Δy = -4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
2.  **Calculate Change in x (Δx)**: Count the horizontal steps from the starting point to the second point.
    *   If moving from x = 3 to x = -3, the change in x is -6 units (going left 6 steps) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. So, Δx = -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
3.  **Determine the Slope**:
    *   Slope = Δy / Δx = -4 / -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
    *   The negatives cancel out, and simplifying the fraction gives 2/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

### Conclusion on Consistency

As demonstrated in these [[examples_of_calculating_slope_from_various_points | examples of calculating slope from various points]], picking any two points on a line and calculating the ratio of the change in y to the change in x will always yield the same slope value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. The key is to remain consistent with your starting and ending points when determining the sign and magnitude of Δy and Δx <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

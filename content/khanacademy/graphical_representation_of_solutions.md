When solving a system of linear equations, the solution represents the specific x and y values that satisfy all equations simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Visualizing Systems of Equations

From a [[Graphical representation of linear equations | graphical perspective]], each linear equation in a system can be represented as a straight line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The "solution sets" for these equations are the lines themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

The solution to a system of two linear equations corresponds to the point where these lines intersect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This intersection point provides the unique x and y values that are common to both equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

### Example Solution

For a system like:
```
3x + 4y = 2.5
5x - 4y = 25.5
```
Using the elimination method, the solution found is:
> [!EXAMPLE] Solution Coordinates
> x = 7/2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>
> y = -2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>

This (7/2, -2) is considered "the coordinate of their intersection" if these equations were graphed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

## Limitations of Graphical Solutions

While [[Visualization techniques in solving equations | visualizing]] equations graphically can provide an intuitive understanding, finding precise solutions solely through [[graphing linear equations | graphing linear equations]] can be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. As mentioned, it's "kind of hard to eyeball things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>, especially with non-integer solutions. This is why [[graphing versus algebraic solutions | algebraic solutions]] (like substitution or elimination) are often more practical for exact answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

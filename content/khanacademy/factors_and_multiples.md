This article explores the concept of the [[least_common_multiple | least common multiple]] (LCM) and methods for finding it.

## Least Common Multiple (LCM)

The [[least_common_multiple | least common multiple]] is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of two or more given integers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. It can be denoted as LCM(a, b) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

### Example: LCM of 36 and 12

For instance, the [[least_common_multiple | least common multiple]] of 36 and 12 is 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This is because 36 is a [[basic_multiplication_concepts | multiple]] of 12 (12 x 3 = 36), and 36 is also a [[basic_multiplication_concepts | multiple]] of itself (36 x 1 = 36) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

### Finding the LCM of 18 and 12

When the relationship between the numbers is not immediately obvious, there are systematic approaches to finding the [[least_common_multiple | least common multiple]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

#### 1. Prime Factorization Approach

This method involves breaking down each number into its prime factors and then constructing the smallest number that contains all the prime factors of both original numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

*   **Step 1: Find the prime factorization of each number.**
    *   For 18: 18 = 2 × 9 = 2 × 3 × 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
    *   For 12: 12 = 2 × 6 = 2 × 2 × 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

*   **Step 2: Construct the LCM using the prime factors.**
    The [[least_common_multiple | least common multiple]] must contain enough prime factors to be divisible by both numbers, but no more, to keep it the smallest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
    *   To be divisible by 18, the LCM needs at least one '2' and two '3's (2 × 3 × 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
    *   To be divisible by 12, the LCM needs at least two '2's and one '3' (2 × 2 × 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
    *   Combine these requirements:
        *   Start with the factors for 18: 2 × 3 × 3.
        *   Now check for 12: We have one '2' but need two, so add another '2'. We have one '3' and only need one.
        *   The LCM is 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

*   **Step 3: Calculate the product.**
    *   LCM(18, 12) = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 = 4 × 9 = 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

This method is systematic and generally more efficient for larger or more complex numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

#### 2. Listing Multiples (Brute Force) Method

This approach involves listing out the [[basic_multiplication_concepts | multiples]] of each number until a common one is found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

*   **Step 1: List [[basic_multiplication_concepts | multiples]] for 18:**
    *   18, 36, 54, ... <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

*   **Step 2: List [[basic_multiplication_concepts | multiples]] for 12:**
    *   12, 24, 36, ... <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

*   **Step 3: Identify the smallest common [[basic_multiplication_concepts | multiple]].**
    *   The smallest common [[basic_multiplication_concepts | multiple]] in both lists is 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

While straightforward for small numbers, this method can become tedious if the [[least_common_multiple | least common multiple]] is a very large number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

Cellular respiration is broadly divided into three phases: [[overview_of_glycolysis | glycolysis]], the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. [[overview_of_glycolysis | Glycolysis]] is the initial step that literally means the breaking down of [[role_of_glucose_in_energy_production | glucose]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Glycolysis: Pyruvate Formation

[[overview_of_glycolysis | Glycolysis]] begins with [[role_of_glucose_in_energy_production | glucose]] (C6H12O6), a six-carbon molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. The [[glycolysis_process_and_phases | glycolysis process and phases]] has two main stages:

1.  **Investment Phase**
    *   This phase utilizes two ATP molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
    *   The [[role_of_glucose_in_energy_production | glucose]] molecule is broken down into two 3-carbon compounds, often referred to as PGAL or phosphoglyceraldehyde, which also contain a phosphate group derived from the ATPs used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. These 3-carbon compounds are also known as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.
    *   Essentially, the six-carbon [[role_of_glucose_in_energy_production | glucose]] is split into two three-carbon molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

2.  **Payoff Phase**
    *   Each of the two PGAL molecules proceeds into this phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
    *   During this phase, each PGAL is converted into **pyruvate** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Pyruvate is a 3-carbon molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>, sometimes called pyruvic acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
    *   For each PGAL molecule, two ATPs are produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Since there are two PGALs, a total of four ATPs are generated in this phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
    *   Additionally, each PGAL produces an [[role_of_nad_in_glycolysis | NADH]] molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. This occurs as NAD+ is reduced to [[role_of_nad_in_glycolysis | NADH]] by gaining a hydrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. As with ATPs, two [[role_of_nad_in_glycolysis | NADH]] molecules are produced for every [[role_of_glucose_in_energy_production | glucose]] molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.

## Significance of Pyruvate

Pyruvate is the end product of [[glycolysis_process_and_its_role_in_breaking_down_glucose | glycolysis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. For every molecule of [[role_of_glucose_in_energy_production | glucose]], two molecules of pyruvate are produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. The fate of pyruvate depends on the presence of oxygen:

*   **Absence of Oxygen:** If oxygen is not available, pyruvate enters [[fermentation_and_its_byproducts | fermentation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. In humans, [[fermentation_and_its_byproducts | fermentation]] produces lactic acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. In other organisms, it might produce alcohol or ethanol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Presence of Oxygen:** If oxygen is present, pyruvate can proceed to the Krebs cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Before entering the Krebs cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle), pyruvate is re-engineered into acetyl-CoA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. This conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA is part of the [[role_of_pyruvate_oxidation_in_preparing_for_the_krebs_cycle | role of pyruvate oxidation in preparing for the Krebs cycle]].

## Net Outputs of Glycolysis

In summary, the overall reaction of [[overview_of_glycolysis | glycolysis]] starts with one [[role_of_glucose_in_energy_production | glucose]] molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. The outputs of [[glycolysis_process_and_its_role_in_breaking_down_glucose | glycolysis]] are:

*   **Two Pyruvates:** The 3-carbon end product of [[overview_of_glycolysis | glycolysis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   **Two [[role_of_nad_in_glycolysis | NADH]]s:** These are later used in the electron transport chain to produce ATPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **Net of Two ATPs:** Although four ATPs are produced in the payoff phase, two ATPs are consumed in the investment phase, resulting in a net gain of two ATPs directly from [[overview_of_glycolysis | glycolysis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

During this process, the carbon in [[role_of_glucose_in_energy_production | glucose]] is oxidized as hydrogens are stripped off and carbons bond more strongly with oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.

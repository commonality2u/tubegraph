Geometry is the study of shapes and space, and how things that we see relate to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The word "geometry" comes from the root "geo," referring to the earth, and "metry," referring to measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Historically, it means "earth measurement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This field encapsulates lines, triangles, circles, angles, patterns, and three-dimensional shapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## The Point: A Zero-Dimensional Concept

The most basic starting point in geometry is a dot, which is called a **point** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
> A point is a position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
> You cannot move on a point; if you move in any direction, you are no longer at that point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
> A point has zero dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>, meaning you can't go up, down, left, right, in, or out of it while staying on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

To distinguish between different points, they are often given labels, typically using letters (e.g., Point A, Point B, Point C, Point D) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Line Segments: A One-Dimensional Object

When you connect all the points between two distinct points along a straight path, this creates a **line segment** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
> A line segment is a collection of points that connect two specific points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
> The two points at the ends of a line segment are called its **endpoints** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
> A line segment is a one-dimensional idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. You can move back or forward along its length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
> A geometrical line segment has no width; it only has a length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

To label a line segment, we use the labels of its endpoints with a line drawn over them. For example, line segment AB is denoted as $\overline{AB}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. The order of the letters does not matter (e.g., $\overline{AB}$ is the same as $\overline{BA}$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

The length of a line segment is indicated by writing the endpoint labels without the line over them. For instance, if the length of line segment AB is five units, it is written as AB = 5 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

## Rays: Extending in One Direction

A **ray** starts at one point and extends infinitely in one direction through another point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
> The starting point of a ray is called the **vertex** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
> Like a line segment, a ray is a one-dimensional figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

To specify a ray, you write the starting point first, followed by another point on the ray, with an arrow over them indicating the direction of infinite extension. For example, ray AD is denoted as $\overrightarrow{AD}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. The order of the letters matters for rays; $\overrightarrow{AD}$ is different from $\overrightarrow{DA}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

## Lines: Extending in Both Directions

A **line** passes through two points and continues infinitely in both directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
> A line never ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
> A line has no endpoints, unlike a line segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

A line passing through points E and F is denoted as $\overleftrightarrow{EF}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

## Colinearity and Midpoints

### Colinearity
Points are said to be **colinear** if they all lie on the same straight line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. For example, if points X, Y, and Z are on the same line, they are colinear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

### Midpoint
If three colinear points X, Y, and Z have the property that the distance between X and Z is the same as the distance between Z and Y (i.e., XZ = ZY), then Z is the **midpoint** of the line segment XY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. The midpoint is exactly halfway between the two endpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

## Dimensions Beyond One

*   **Points** have zero dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.
*   **Lines**, line segments, and rays have one dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.
*   **Planes** have two dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. In a two-dimensional object (like a screen), you can move forwards/backwards and up/down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. A piece of paper that extends infinitely in every direction is a geometric plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. A finite piece of paper could be considered a "plane segment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   **Three-dimensional space** allows movement left/right, up/down, and also in/out of the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. Higher dimensions can also be studied in mathematics, though they are difficult to visualize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

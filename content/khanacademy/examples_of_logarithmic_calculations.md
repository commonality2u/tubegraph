This article provides examples of calculating and [[evaluating_logarithmic_expressions | evaluating logarithmic expressions]], demonstrating the inverse relationship between logarithms and exponents.

## Introduction to Logarithms

A [[introduction_to_logarithms | logarithm]] is essentially the inverse of taking an exponent of something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. This means logarithms and exponents have an [[inverse_relationship_between_logarithms_and_exponents | inverse relationship]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

## [[Logarithm notation | Logarithm Notation]]

The term "log" is short for [[introduction_to_logarithms | logarithm]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.
If an exponential expression is `b^y = x`, then its equivalent [[logarithm notation | logarithmic notation]] is `log base b of x = y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.
When asked to evaluate `log base b of x`, the question being asked is: "b to what power is equal to x?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a> The answer to a [[introduction_to_logarithms | logarithm]] expression is the exponent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.

## [[Commonbase logarithm examples | Common Logarithm Examples]]

Here are several examples demonstrating how to calculate logarithms:

### Example 1: log base 2 of 8
If we have 2 to the third power, it equals 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.
Therefore, `log base 2 of 8` is equal to 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.
*This means 2 to the power of 3 equals 8.*

### Example 2: log base 4 of 64
To find `log base 4 of 64`, we ask: "4 to what power is equal to 64?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.
We know that 4 to the third power is 64 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.
So, `log base 4 of 64` is equal to 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.

### Example 3: log base 10 of 1,000,000
To calculate `log base 10 of 1,000,000`, we ask: "10 to what power is equal to 1,000,000?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.
Since 10 to the sixth power is 1,000,000 (1 followed by six zeros) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>,
`log base 10 of 1,000,000` is equal to 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

### Example 4: log base 1/2 of 1/8
For `log base 1/2 of 1/8`, we ask: "1/2 to what power is equal to 1/8?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>.
We know that 1/2 to the third power is equal to 1/8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.
Therefore, `log base 1/2 of 1/8` is equal to 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.

## Finding the Base of a Logarithm

Sometimes, the unknown in a logarithm problem is the base itself.

### Example: log base x of 27 = 3
This expression can be rewritten as `x to the third power is equal to 27` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.
To find `x`, we take the cubed root of 27 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>.
The number that, when multiplied by itself three times, equals 27 is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>.
So, `x = 3`. This means `log base 3 of 27` is equal to 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.

## [[Special cases in logarithms | Special Cases in Logarithms]]

There are specific cases for logarithm evaluation that are important to remember.

### Example 5: log base 100 of 1
We ask: "100 to what power is equal to 1?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>.
Based on exponent rules, any non-zero number raised to the 0-th power is equal to 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>.
So, 100 to the 0 power equals 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>.
Thus, `log base 100 of 1` is equal to 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>.

### Example 6: log base 2 of 0 (Undefined)
We ask: "2 to some power `x` is equal to 0?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>.
There is no real number that you can raise 2 to the power of to get 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>.
Therefore, `log base 2 of 0` is undefined or has no solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>.

### Example 7: log base 3 of -1 (Undefined)
We ask: "3 to some power `x` is equal to -1?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>.
Assuming we are dealing with real numbers, there is nothing you can raise 3 to the power of to get a negative number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>.
Therefore, `log base 3 of -1` is undefined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>.
*For a [[introduction_to_logarithms | logarithm]] to be defined with a positive base, the number being evaluated must be greater than 0; it cannot be 0 or negative* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>.

## Logarithms with Negative Exponents

### Example 8: log base 8 of 1/64
We ask: "8 to what power equals 1/64?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>.
We know that 8 squared (8 to the power of 2) is 64 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>.
From the rules of negative exponents, 8 to the negative 2 power is the same as 1 divided by 8 to the 2 power, which is 1/64 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>.
Thus, `log base 8 of 1/64` is equal to -2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>.
*When taking the inverse of the number you are finding the logarithm of, the answer becomes negative* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a>.

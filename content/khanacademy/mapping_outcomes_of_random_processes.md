A [[random_variables | random variable]] is a concept used to map outcomes of random processes to numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This process is essentially [[quantifying_outcomes_for_probability | quantifying the outcomes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

It is important to understand that [[random_variables | random variables]] differ from traditional variables found in algebra, which can be solved for or assigned specific values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Unlike algebraic variables, a [[random_variables | random variable]] can take on many different values, each with its own probability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Therefore, it makes more sense to discuss the probability of a [[random_variables | random variable]] equaling, being less than, or being greater than a certain value, or possessing a specific property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

## Notation

[[random_variables | Random variables]] are typically denoted by capital letters, such as capital X or capital Y <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## [[examples_of_random_variables | Examples of Random Variables]]

### Coin Flip
One common [[examples_of_random_variables | example of a random variable]] involves a coin flip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
A [[random_variables | random variable]] (e.g., capital X) can be defined as:
*   X = 1 if the coin lands on heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>
*   X = 0 if the coin lands on tails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>

Although other values could be assigned (e.g., 100 for heads, 703 for tails), the 1/0 mapping is typical and clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This demonstrates how a random process (flipping a coin) has its outcomes (heads or tails) mapped and [[quantifying_outcomes_for_probability | quantified]] to numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### Sum of Dice Rolls
Another [[examples_of_random_variables | example]] involves rolling multiple dice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. A [[random_variables | random variable]] (e.g., capital Y) can be defined as the sum of the upward faces after rolling seven dice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. This quantifies the outcome of the random process of rolling the dice and observing the results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

## Usefulness of [[random_variables | Random Variables]]

Defining [[random_variables | random variables]] is useful because it allows for more mathematical operations and cleaner notation when working with probabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

For instance, instead of writing "the probability that the sum of the upward faces after rolling seven dice is less than or equal to 30" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>, one can simply write:
> P(Y â‰¤ 30) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>

Similarly, to ask for the probability that the sum is even, one can write:
> P(Y is even) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>

This concise notation clarifies the expression of probabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## Further Discussion

The next discussion will delve into the different types of [[random_variables | random variables]], including [[discrete_random_variables | discrete random variables]] and [[continuous_random_variables | continuous random variables]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

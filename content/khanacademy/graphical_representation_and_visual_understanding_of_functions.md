A function is a concept that takes an input, processes it, and then produces a given output based on that input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A key characteristic of a function is that for any single input, it produces *only one* possible output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Function Notation

Functions are commonly denoted using notation like `f(x)`, where:
*   `f` is typically the name of the function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   `x` is the variable used for the input to the function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
However, other letters can be used for both the function name and the input variable (e.g., `h(a)`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

To find the output of a function for a specific input, the input value replaces the variable in the function's definition. For example, to evaluate `f(2)`, you substitute `2` for `x` wherever it appears in the function's rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Examples of Functions

Functions can operate on inputs in various ways, ranging from mathematical calculations to more abstract operations.

### Conditional Mathematical Function
A function can apply different rules based on properties of the input.
For example:
*   `f(x) = x^2`, if x is even <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>
*   `f(x) = x + 5`, if x is odd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>

Evaluating this function:
*   For an input of `2`: Since `2` is even, `f(2) = 2^2 = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   For an input of `3`: Since `3` is odd, `f(3) = 3 + 5 = 8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

### Abstract Function Based on Language
Functions are highly general tools that can perform very unconventional operations.
For example, define `h(a)` as "the next largest number that starts with the same letter as variable `a`," assuming operations are in English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:03:00]</a>.

Evaluating this function:
*   For an input of `2` (starts with 'T'): The next largest number starting with 'T' is `3` (three), so `h(2) = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   For an input of `8` (starts with 'E'): The next largest number starting with 'E' is `11` (eleven), so `h(8) = 11` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

### Simple Algebraic Function
Many familiar equations can be viewed as functions. For instance, `y = x + 1` can be written as `f(x) = x + 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   For an input of `0`: `f(0) = 0 + 1 = 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
*   For an input of `2`: `f(2) = 2 + 1 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

This relationship can also be represented using a table, mapping inputs (`x`) to outputs (`y`):
| x | y |
|---|---|
| 0 | 1 |
| 2 | 3 |
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>

## What is Not a Function?

A relationship is *not* a function if a single input can produce more than one possible output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

### [[Visual representation of equations | Graphical Representation]] of a Non-Function
Consider the equation of a circle centered at the origin with radius `2`: `x^2 + y^2 = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
When this equation is [[graphing equations | graphed]], it creates a circle.
*   If we take an input, `x = 1`, and plug it into the equation:
    *   `1^2 + y^2 = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>
    *   `1 + y^2 = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>
    *   `y^2 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>
    *   `y = ±√3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>
*   This means that for the single input `x = 1`, there are two possible outputs: positive `√3` and negative `√3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   Because one input (`x=1`) yields two different outputs (`√3` and `-√3`), this relationship (a circle) is not a function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

This concept is key to the [[graphical interpretation of systems of equations | graphical interpretation]] of relationships, as a vertical line test can be used to determine if a graph represents a function (if any vertical line intersects the graph at more than one point, it is not a function).

A logarithm is defined as the [[relationship_between_exponents_and_logarithms | inverse]] of taking the exponent of something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The word "logarithm" is often shortened to "log" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Understanding Logarithms

To explain logarithms, consider an exponentiation expression:
If 2 to the third power is equal to 8, which is written as 2³ = 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, then the [[introduction_to_logarithms | logarithm]] can be expressed as:
`log base 2 of 8 is equal to 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

This expression, "log base 2 of 8," asks: "2 to what power is equal to 8?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. The answer to a [[evaluating_logarithmic_expressions | logarithm expression]] is the exponent to which the base number (2 in this case) must be raised to get the given value (8) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. In this example, the exponent is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

Logarithms are a simple idea, but can be confusing because they are the inverse of exponentiation, which can also be a complex concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## [[examples_of_calculating_logarithms | Examples of Calculating Logarithms]]

*   **Example 1: Finding the Exponent**
    *   `log base 4 of 64 = x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>
    *   This can be rewritten as `4^x = 64` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
    *   Since 4³ = 64 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, `x = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
    *   Thus, `log base 4 of 64 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

*   **Example 2: Logarithm of a Large Number**
    *   `log base 10 of 1,000,000 = ?` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>
    *   This asks: `10 to what power is equal to 1,000,000?` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
    *   10 to the power of any number (n) is 1 followed by n zeros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
    *   Since 1,000,000 is 1 followed by six zeros, it is 10⁶ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
    *   Therefore, `log base 10 of 1,000,000 = 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

*   **Example 3: Logarithm with a Fractional Base**
    *   `log base 1/2 of 1/8 = x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>
    *   This is equivalent to `(1/2)^x = 1/8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
    *   Since (1/2)³ = 1/8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, `log base 1/2 of 1/8 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

*   **Example 4: Finding the Base of the Logarithm**
    *   `log base x of 27 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>
    *   This translates to `x³ = 27` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
    *   To find x, you take the cubed root of 27 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
    *   The number that, when multiplied by itself three times, equals 27 is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
    *   So, `x = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, and `log base 3 of 27 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

*   **Example 5: Logarithm of 1**
    *   `log base 100 of 1 = ?` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>
    *   This asks: `100 to what power is equal to 1?` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
    *   According to [[exponent_rules_and_radicals | exponent rules]], any non-zero number raised to the 0-th power is equal to 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
    *   Therefore, `100^0 = 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>, and `log base 100 of 1 = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

*   **Example 6: [[negative_exponents_in_logarithms | Logarithm with a Negative Exponent]]**
    *   `log base 8 of 1/64 = ?` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>
    *   We know that `log base 8 of 64` would be 2, because 8² = 64 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
    *   The question is `8 to what power equals 1/64?` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
    *   From the [[negative_exponents_in_logarithms | negative exponent module]], 8⁻² = 1/8² = 1/64 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
    *   So, `log base 8 of 1/64 = -2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

## [[undefined_logarithms_and_constraints | Undefined Logarithms and Constraints]]

Some logarithms are [[undefined_logarithms_and_constraints | undefined]]:

*   **Logarithm of Zero**: `log base 2 of 0 = ?` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>
    *   This asks: `2^x = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
    *   There is no real number that you can raise 2 to the power of to get 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
    *   Therefore, `log base 2 of 0` is [[undefined_logarithms_and_constraints | undefined]] or has no solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

*   **Logarithm of a Negative Number**: `log base 3 of -1 = ?` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>
    *   This asks: `3^x = -1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
    *   Assuming one is dealing with real numbers, there is no number that you can raise 3 to the power of to get a negative number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
    *   Therefore, `log base 3 of -1` is [[undefined_logarithms_and_constraints | undefined]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

In general, for a positive base, the number for which you are taking the logarithm must be greater than 0; it cannot be 0 and it cannot be negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Further [[logarithm_properties_and_notation | properties of logarithms]] will be explored in future modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

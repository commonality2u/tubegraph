From: [[khanacademy]] <br/> 

A [[introduction_to_logarithms | logarithm]] is essentially the inverse operation of taking the exponent of something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The word "logarithm" itself is noted as an unusual word, similar to "hypotenuse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The term "log" is simply a short form for logarithm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Understanding the Inverse Relationship

To understand what a [[introduction_to_logarithms | logarithm]] is, consider an exponential expression:
*   If $2^3 = 8$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, then the equivalent [[logarithm_notation | logarithmic notation]] is $log_2 8 = 3$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

This [[logarithm_notation | logarithmic expression]] $log_2 8$ asks: "2 to what power is equal to 8?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The answer to a [[introduction_to_logarithms | logarithm]] expression is the exponent to which the base must be raised to get the given number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. In this case, 2 raised to the power of 3 equals 8, so $log_2 8 = 3$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### Finding the Exponent
*   **Example 1:** What is $log_4 64$? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>
    *   This can be rewritten as $4^x = 64$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
    *   Since $4^3 = 64$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, then $log_4 64 = 3$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **Example 2:** What is $log_{10} 1,000,000$? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>
    *   This asks: "10 to what power is equal to 1,000,000?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>
    *   A number like 1,000,000 (1 followed by six zeros) is $10^6$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
    *   Therefore, $log_{10} 1,000,000 = 6$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. The 6 is the exponent needed to raise 10 to get 1,000,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
*   **Example 3:** What is $log_{1/2} (1/8)$? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>
    *   This asks: "$(1/2)^x = 1/8$" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
    *   Since $(1/2)^3 = 1/8$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, then $log_{1/2} (1/8) = 3$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
*   **Example 4:** What is $log_8 (1/64)$? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>
    *   This asks: "$8^x = 1/64$" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
    *   Knowing that $8^2 = 64$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a> and applying rules for negative exponents, $8^{-2} = 1/8^2 = 1/64$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
    *   Therefore, $log_8 (1/64) = -2$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

### Finding the Base
*   **Example:** If $log_x 27 = 3$, what is x? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>
    *   This translates to $x^3 = 27$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
    *   To find x, take the cube root of 27 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
    *   Since $3 \times 3 \times 3 = 27$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>, then $x = 3$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
    *   So, $log_3 27 = 3$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

## [[special_cases_in_logarithms | Special Cases and Undefined Logarithms]]

Certain conditions result in specific or undefined [[evaluating_logarithmic_expressions | logarithmic expressions]]:

### Logarithm of 1
*   **Example:** What is $log_{100} 1$? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>
    *   This asks: "$100^x = 1$" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
    *   Based on [[logarithm_properties_and_rules | exponent rules]], any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 equals 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
    *   Therefore, $100^0 = 1$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>, so $log_{100} 1 = 0$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

### Logarithm of Zero
*   **Example:** What is $log_2 0$? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>
    *   This asks: "$2^x = 0$" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
    *   There is no real number that you can raise 2 to the power of to get 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
    *   Thus, $log_2 0$ is undefined or has no solution in real numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

### Logarithm of a Negative Number
*   **Example:** What is $log_3 (-1)$? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>
    *   This asks: "$3^x = -1$" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
    *   Assuming real numbers, there is no power to which you can raise 3 to obtain a negative number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
    *   Thus, $log_3 (-1)$ is undefined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

In general, for a [[introduction_to_logarithms | logarithm]] to be defined (in real numbers), the number you are taking the [[introduction_to_logarithms | logarithm]] of must be greater than 0; it cannot be 0 or negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

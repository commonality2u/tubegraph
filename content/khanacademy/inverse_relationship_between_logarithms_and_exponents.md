From: [[khanacademy]] <br/> 

A logarithm is defined as the inverse of taking the [[understanding_exponents | exponent]] of something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The term "logarithm" itself can be a strange and unusual word, similar to "hypotenuse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Understanding the Inverse Relationship

To understand what a logarithm is, consider an [[understanding_exponents | exponent]] expression. For example, we know from [[understanding_exponents | exponent]] modules that 2 to the third power is equal to 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

In [[logarithm_notation_and_conversion | logarithm notation]], this relationship is expressed as:
`log base 2 of 8 is equal to 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

Here, "log" is a shorthand for the word logarithm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. When you encounter "log base 2 of 8," it is essentially asking: "2 to what power is equal to 8?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a> The answer to this [[evaluating_logarithmic_expressions | logarithm expression]] is the [[understanding_exponents | exponent]] to which the base (2) must be raised to get the given number (8), which in this case is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## Examples of Logarithms

Let's explore several examples to solidify this concept:

### Example 1: Finding the Exponent

If you are asked to solve `log base 4 of 64 = x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, this equation can be rewritten in [[logarithm_notation and_conversion | exponent form]] as `4 to the x power is equal to 64` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
To find `x`, you ask: "4 to what power is equal to 64?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>
Since 4 to the third power (4 * 4 * 4) is 64 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, then `x = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
Thus, `log base 4 of 64 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

### Example 2: Logarithms with Powers of 10

Consider `log base 10 of 1,000,000` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
This asks: "10 to what power is equal to 1,000,000?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>
A power of 10 results in 1 followed by a number of zeros equal to the [[understanding_exponents | exponent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Since 1,000,000 has six zeros, it is 10 to the sixth power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
Therefore, `log base 10 of 1,000,000 = 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
The 6 is the [[understanding_exponents | exponent]] that we raise 10 to in order to get 1,000,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

### Example 3: Logarithms with Fractions

Let's solve `log base 1/2 of 1/8 = x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
In [[logarithm_notation_and_conversion | exponent form]], this is `(1/2) to the x power = 1/8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
Since (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8, then `x = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
So, `log base 1/2 of 1/8 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

### Example 4: Finding the Base of a Logarithm

Consider `log base x of 27 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
This can be rewritten as `x to the third power = 27` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
To find `x`, you need to calculate the cubed root of 27 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
The number that, when multiplied by itself three times, equals 27 is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
Therefore, `x = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, and we can write `log base 3 of 27 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

## Undefined Logarithms and Special Cases

### Logarithm of 1

Let's evaluate `log base 100 of 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
This translates to `100 to the question mark power = 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
From the [[understanding_exponents | exponent]] rules, any number raised to the 0-th power is equal to 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
So, `100 to the 0 power = 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
Thus, `log base 100 of 1 = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

### Logarithm of Zero or a Negative Number

Consider `log base 2 of 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
This would mean `2 to some power x = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. There is no real number that you can raise 2 to the power of to get 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Therefore, `log base 2 of 0` is **undefined** or has no solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

Similarly, `log base 3 of -1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a> is also **undefined** in the realm of real numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
With a positive base, there is no power you can raise it to that will result in a negative number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

> [!rule] Condition for Defined Logarithms
> For a logarithm `log base b of x` to be defined (assuming a positive base `b`), the number `x` (the argument of the logarithm) must be greater than 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. It cannot be 0 and it cannot be negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

## Logarithms with Negative Exponents (Fractions)

Let's look at `log base 8 of 1/64` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
We know that `log base 8 of 64 = 2` because `8 squared = 64` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
The question here is `8 to what power = 1/64` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>?
From [[exponents_and_radical_notation | negative exponent]] rules, we know that 8 to the power of negative 2 (8^-2) is the same as 1/(8^2) or 1/64 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
Therefore, `log base 8 of 1/64 = -2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
When you take the inverse of the number you're taking the logarithm of, it turns the answer negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

These examples illustrate that [[introduction_to_logarithms | logarithms]] are a simple idea at their core, but can seem confusing because they are the inverse of [[understanding_exponents | exponentiation]], which itself can be a complex concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Further [[properties_of_logarithms | properties of logarithms]] will be explored in future modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

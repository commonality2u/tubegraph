Many concepts in biology and chemistry, though seemingly simple, can be confusing. This article aims to clarify the ideas of solutions, diffusion, and specifically, osmosis through [[cellular_membrane_structure | semi-permeable membranes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Basic Concepts: Solute, Solvent, and Solution

To understand osmosis, it's essential to first grasp the basic definitions of [[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | solvent and solute]] within a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>:
*   **Solvent**: The component present in a larger quantity, often water in biological systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. It is the substance doing the dissolving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.
*   **Solute**: The component present in a smaller quantity, which is dissolved into the solvent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. For example, sugar dissolved in water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.
*   **Solution**: The homogeneous mixture formed when a solute is dissolved in a solvent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

## Diffusion

[[diffusion_in_gases_and_liquids | Diffusion]] is the general principle of particles or molecules spreading out from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>, ultimately aiming to reach [[concentration_gradients_and_equilibrium | equilibrium]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. This occurs due to the random kinetic energy and bumping of molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.

**Concentration** refers to the amount of a specific particle per unit of space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>. A high concentration means many particles in a given space, while a low concentration means few <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.

### Hypertonic and Hypotonic Solutions

When comparing two solutions, their solute concentrations define them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>:
*   [[hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | **Hypertonic Solution**]]: A solution with a high concentration of solute relative to another solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>.
*   [[hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | **Hypotonic Solution**]]: A solution with a low concentration of solute relative to another solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>.

If there are no barriers, solutes will diffuse from a [[hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | hypertonic solution]] to a [[hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | hypotonic solution]] until concentrations are roughly equal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>.

## Osmosis

Osmosis is a specific type of [[diffusion_in_gases_and_liquids | diffusion]] that applies to a solvent, typically water, across a [[cellular_membrane_structure | semi-permeable membrane]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:08:00">[17:08:00]</a>.

### Semipermeable Membranes

A [[cellular_membrane_structure | semi-permeable membrane]] allows certain molecules to pass through while restricting others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13:00]</a>. For example, a membrane might have pores large enough for small water molecules to pass, but too small for larger sugar molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:00">[12:44:00]</a>.

### How Osmosis Works

Consider a scenario where a [[cellular_membrane_structure | semi-permeable membrane]] separates two solutions:
*   **Inside the membrane**: A [[hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | hypertonic solution]] with a high concentration of solute (e.g., sugar) and water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:25:00">[13:25:00]</a>.
*   **Outside the membrane**: A [[hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | hypotonic solution]] with a lower concentration of solute and water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:00">[13:32:00]</a>.

Since the solute cannot pass through the membrane, the system seeks to equilibrate the concentrations by moving the solvent (water) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:27:00">[16:27:00]</a>. Water molecules on the hypertonic side are more likely to be "blocked" by the larger solute molecules when trying to exit the membrane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:12:00">[15:12:00]</a>. Conversely, water molecules from the hypotonic side face less obstruction when entering the membrane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:35:00">[15:35:00]</a>.

This probabilistic imbalance results in a net flow of water:
*   Water moves from the [[hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | hypotonic solution]] (lower solute concentration) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:51:00">[15:51:00]</a>
*   To the [[hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | hypertonic solution]] (higher solute concentration) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:56:00">[15:56:00]</a>.

This movement of water aims to dilute the more concentrated solution, making the concentrations on both sides of the membrane more equal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:52:00">[17:52:00]</a>. If the membrane is flexible, this influx of water can cause the compartment with the hypertonic solution to swell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:53:00">[16:53:00]</a>.

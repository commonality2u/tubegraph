Several related concepts, though seemingly simple, often cause confusion when discussed together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Understanding them is crucial for comprehending biological and chemical processes.

## [[concept_of_solutions_solvents_and_solutes | Solutions, Solvents, and Solutes]]

A [[concept_of_solutions_solvents_and_solutes | solution]] is formed when one substance is dissolved into another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03">[02:03]</a>. In this mixture:
*   **[[concept_of_solutions_solvents_and_solutes | Solvent]]** – The substance present in a greater quantity (by number of molecules) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, which does the dissolving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Water is the most common [[concept_of_solutions_solvents_and_solutes | solvent]] in biological and chemical systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
*   **[[concept_of_solutions_solvents_and_solutes | Solute]]** – The substance present in a lesser quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, which is dissolved into the [[concept_of_solutions_solvents_and_solutes | solvent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

For example, if sugar molecules are mixed with water, water is the [[concept_of_solutions_solvents_and_solutes | solvent]] and sugar is the [[concept_of_solutions_solvents_and_solutes | solute]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## [[diffusion_explanation_and_examples | Diffusion]]

[[diffusion_explanation_and_examples | Diffusion]] is the process by which particles or molecules spread out from an area of higher [[role_of_concentration_gradients_in_diffusion_and_osmosis | concentration]] to an area of lower [[role_of_concentration_gradients_in_diffusion_and_osmosis | concentration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. This occurs due to the random kinetic energy of the particles, causing them to bump into each other and eventually spread evenly throughout the available space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Over time, a system will tend towards an equilibrium where [[role_of_concentration_gradients_in_diffusion_and_osmosis | concentrations]] are roughly equal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

### [[role_of_concentration_gradients_in_diffusion_and_osmosis | Concentration]]

[[role_of_concentration_gradients_in_diffusion_and_osmosis | Concentration]] refers to the amount of a particular particle per unit of space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. A region with many particles per unit space has a high [[role_of_concentration_gradients_in_diffusion_and_osmosis | concentration]], while a region with few particles per unit space has a low [[role_of_concentration_gradients_in_diffusion_and_osmosis | concentration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

### [[concept_of_hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | Hypertonic and Hypotonic Solutions]]

These terms describe the relative [[role_of_concentration_gradients_in_diffusion_and_osmosis | concentration]] of [[concept_of_solutions_solvents_and_solutes | solute]]s in a solution:
*   **[[concept_of_hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | Hypertonic Solution]]** – A solution with a high [[role_of_concentration_gradients_in_diffusion_and_osmosis | concentration]] of [[concept_of_solutions_solvents_and_solutes | solute]]s relative to another solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   **[[concept_of_hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | Hypotonic Solution]]** – A solution with a low [[role_of_concentration_gradients_in_diffusion_and_osmosis | concentration]] of [[concept_of_solutions_solvents_and_solutes | solute]]s relative to another solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

In general, [[concept_of_solutions_solvents_and_solutes | solute]]s diffuse from a [[concept_of_hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | hypertonic]] (high [[role_of_concentration_gradients_in_diffusion_and_osmosis | concentration]]) solution to a [[concept_of_hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | hypotonic]] (low [[role_of_concentration_gradients_in_diffusion_and_osmosis | concentration]]) solution if there are no barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

## Osmosis and [[cellular_membrane_and_its_significance | Semipermeable Membranes]]

Osmosis is a specific type of [[diffusion_explanation_and_examples | diffusion]] involving water (the [[concept_of_solutions_solvents_and_solutes | solvent]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>, across a [[cellular_membrane_and_its_significance | semipermeable membrane]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.

### [[cellular_membrane_and_its_significance | Semipermeable Membrane]]

A [[cellular_membrane_and_its_significance | semipermeable membrane]] allows certain molecules (like water) to pass through, but blocks others (like larger [[concept_of_solutions_solvents_and_solutes | solute]] molecules) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. This is because the membrane has pores or openings that are large enough for smaller molecules to pass, but too small for larger molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

### The Process of Osmosis

When a [[cellular_membrane_and_its_significance | semipermeable membrane]] separates a [[concept_of_hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | hypertonic solution]] (high [[concept_of_solutions_solvents_and_solutes | solute]] [[role_of_concentration_gradients_in_diffusion_and_osmosis | concentration]]) from a [[concept_of_hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | hypotonic solution]] (low [[concept_of_solutions_solvents_and_solutes | solute]] [[role_of_concentration_gradients_in_diffusion_and_osmosis | concentration]]):
1.  The [[concept_of_solutions_solvents_and_solutes | solute]] molecules cannot cross the [[cellular_membrane_and_its_significance | membrane]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.
2.  Water molecules, however, can pass through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.
3.  On the [[concept_of_hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | hypertonic]] side, the presence of many [[concept_of_solutions_solvents_and_solutes | solute]] molecules slightly reduces the probability of water molecules approaching and passing through the [[cellular_membrane_and_its_significance | membrane]] to exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.
4.  On the [[concept_of_hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | hypotonic]] side, with fewer [[concept_of_solutions_solvents_and_solutes | solute]]s, there's less obstruction, making it more probable for water molecules to enter the [[concept_of_hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | hypertonic]] side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.
5.  This results in a net flow of water from the [[concept_of_hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | hypotonic solution]] (low [[concept_of_solutions_solvents_and_solutes | solute]] [[role_of_concentration_gradients_in_diffusion_and_osmosis | concentration]]) to the [[concept_of_hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | hypertonic solution]] (high [[concept_of_solutions_solvents_and_solutes | solute]] [[role_of_concentration_gradients_in_diffusion_and_osmosis | concentration]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.
6.  The purpose of this water movement is to try and equalize the [[role_of_concentration_gradients_in_diffusion_and_osmosis | concentrations]] on both sides of the [[cellular_membrane_and_its_significance | membrane]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. This entire process is called osmosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.

In summary, [[diffusion_explanation_and_examples | diffusion]] refers to the spreading of any particle from high to low [[role_of_concentration_gradients_in_diffusion_and_osmosis | concentration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>, while osmosis is specifically the [[diffusion_explanation_and_examples | diffusion]] of water (the [[concept_of_solutions_solvents_and_solutes | solvent]]) across a [[cellular_membrane_and_its_significance | semipermeable membrane]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>.

[[Diffusion basics | Diffusion]] is the process where particles or molecules spread out from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. This happens because molecules possess kinetic energy and are constantly moving and bumping into each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, eventually leading to a more even distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## Basic Concepts: Solutions, Solvents, and Solutes

To understand osmosis, it's helpful to define key terms related to solutions:

*   **Solution**: A combination of [[definition_and_role_of_solvent_and_solute | solvent]] and [[definition_and_role_of_solvent_and_solute | solute]] molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   **[[definition_and_role_of_solvent_and_solute | Solvent]]**: The substance present in a greater quantity, responsible for dissolving another substance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. For example, in liquid water with sugar molecules, water is the [[definition_and_role_of_solvent_and_solute | solvent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Water is the most common [[definition_and_role_of_solvent_and_solute | solvent]] in biological and chemical systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
*   **[[definition_and_role_of_solvent_and_solute | Solute]]**: The substance present in a lesser quantity that is dissolved by the [[definition_and_role_of_solvent_and_solute | solvent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. For instance, sugar in water acts as the [[definition_and_role_of_solvent_and_solute | solute]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

Concentration refers to the amount of a particle per unit space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

*   **[[hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | Hypertonic solution]]**: A solution with a high concentration of [[definition_and_role_of_solvent_and_solute | solute]] relative to another solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   **[[hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | Hypotonic solution]]**: A solution with a low concentration of [[definition_and_role_of_solvent_and_solute | solute]] relative to another solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

## The Role of Semipermeable Membranes

Osmosis specifically describes the [[Diffusion basics | diffusion]] of [[definition_and_role_of_solvent_and_solute | water]] (the [[definition_and_role_of_solvent_and_solute | solvent]]) across a [[cellular_membrane_and_its_role | semi-permeable membrane]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>. A [[cellular_membrane_and_its_role | semi-permeable membrane]] allows certain molecules to pass through while restricting others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. In the context of osmosis, this membrane is permeable to [[definition_and_role_of_solvent_and_solute | water]] but not to the [[definition_and_role_of_solvent_and_solute | solute]] (e.g., sugar molecules) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. This restriction is often due to the larger size of [[definition_and_role_of_solvent_and_solute | solute]] molecules compared to the pores in the membrane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

## How Osmosis Works

Consider a situation where a [[cellular_membrane_and_its_role | semi-permeable membrane]] separates two solutions: one [[hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | hypertonic]] (high [[definition_and_role_of_solvent_and_solute | solute]] concentration) and one [[hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | hypotonic]] (low [[definition_and_role_of_solvent_and_solute | solute]] concentration) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

Because the [[definition_and_role_of_solvent_and_solute | solute]] cannot cross the membrane, the system seeks to equalize concentrations by moving the [[definition_and_role_of_solvent_and_solute | solvent]], which is typically [[definition_and_role_of_solvent_and_solute | water]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.

*   On the [[hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | hypertonic]] side, the presence of more [[definition_and_role_of_solvent_and_solute | solute]] molecules means there are fewer [[definition_and_role_of_solvent_and_solute | water]] molecules relative to the [[hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | hypotonic]] side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.
*   The [[definition_and_role_of_solvent_and_solute | solute]] molecules can also physically block or interfere with the [[definition_and_role_of_solvent_and_solute | water]] molecules' access to the membrane's pores from the [[hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | hypertonic]] side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.

Due to these probabilistic interactions, [[definition_and_role_of_solvent_and_solute | water]] molecules are more likely to enter the [[hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | hypertonic]] side from the [[hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | hypotonic]] side than to exit it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>. This results in a net flow of [[definition_and_role_of_solvent_and_solute | water]] from the [[hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | hypotonic]] (lower [[definition_and_role_of_solvent_and_solute | solute]] concentration) solution to the [[hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | hypertonic]] (higher [[definition_and_role_of_solvent_and_solute | solute]] concentration) solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. The goal is to equilibrate the concentrations on both sides of the membrane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.

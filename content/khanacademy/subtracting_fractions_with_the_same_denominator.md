When [[adding fractions with the same denominator|adding]] or subtracting fractions, the process is straightforward if the denominators are the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The denominator is the bottom number in a fraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, while the numerator is the top number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

## The Rule for Subtraction

The rule for subtracting fractions with the same denominator is the same as for [[adding fractions with the same denominator|adding]] them:
1.  Keep the denominator (the bottom number) the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
2.  Subtract the numerators (the top numbers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### Example: Subtracting Fractions

Consider the problem 3/7 minus 2/7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

```
3/7 - 2/7 = ?
```

To solve this:
1.  The denominators are both 7, so the denominator of the answer will also be 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
2.  Subtract the numerators: 3 minus 2 equals 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

Therefore:
```
3/7 - 2/7 = 1/7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>
```

### Conceptual Understanding

This concept can be understood using a "pie" analogy:
*   If you have a pie divided into 7 pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   And you have 3 out of those 7 pieces (3/7 of the pie) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   If you then give away 2 out of those 7 pieces (2/7 of the pie) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   You will be left with 1 of the 7 pieces of pie (1/7) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

Subtracting fractions works similarly to [[adding_fractions_with_the_same_denominator | adding fractions with the same denominator]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:39">[02:31:39]</a>. This concept is generally straightforward when the denominators (the bottom numbers of the fraction) are identical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:15">[03:00:15]</a>.

## How to Subtract

When subtracting fractions that share the same denominator:
1.  Verify that the denominators are indeed the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:05">[02:11:05]</a>.
2.  The denominator of the answer will remain the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:11">[02:16:11]</a>.
3.  Subtract the numerators (the top numbers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:07">[02:42:07]</a>.

### Example 1

Consider the problem: 3/7 - 2/7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:04">[02:33:04]</a>

Here, both fractions have a denominator of 7. To find the answer, subtract the numerators (3 - 2) and keep the denominator the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:07">[02:42:07]</a>:

3/7 - 2/7 = (3 - 2) / 7 = 1/7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:04">[02:33:04]</a>

This can be understood with a pie analogy: If you have 3 out of 7 pieces of a pie and you give away 2 out of those 7 pieces, you are left with 1 of the 7 pieces of the pie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:07">[02:48:07]</a>.

### Example 2

The same principle applies even when the result is a negative number:

1/10 - 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:08">[07:55:08]</a>

First, rewrite the whole number 1 as a fraction with a denominator of 10. Since 10/10 equals 1, the problem becomes:
1/10 - 10/10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:09">[08:04:09]</a>

Now, subtract the numerators and keep the denominator:
(1 - 10) / 10 = -9/10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:07">[08:16:07]</a>

### Key Takeaway

For [[introduction_to_adding_and_subtracting_fractions | adding and subtracting fractions]] with the same denominator, you only need to perform the operation (addition or subtraction) on the numerators, while the denominator remains unchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:02">[01:34:02]</a>. Remember to [[simplifying_fractions | simplify fractions]] if possible after the operation.

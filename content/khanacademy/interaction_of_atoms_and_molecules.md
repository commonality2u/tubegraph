Chemistry is often associated with scientists, vials of chemicals, and various reactions that change colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It's also linked to [[Chemical reactions and equations | chemical equations]] that illustrate how different substances interact to form new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, and models depicting molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The periodic table of elements is another key association <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

At its core, [[The role of chemistry in understanding reality | chemistry helps us understand]] and predict aspects of our reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The periodic table, a fundamental tool in chemistry, is the result of thousands of years of human effort to grasp the world's complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Understanding the Building Blocks of Reality

The universe presents an overwhelming array of substances, from fire and water to celestial bodies and the intricate patterns of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Even the human brain exhibits immense complexity through its electrochemical interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. For a long time, understanding this diversity was a significant challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

Fortunately, modern understanding reveals that all this complexity stems from basic building blocks, similar to Legos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. There isn't an infinite variety of these blocks, but rather a finite number of [[Atoms as the smallest unit of elements | elements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Most of what we observe is formed from different combinations of common [[Atoms as the smallest unit of elements | elements]] like carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

Even [[Atoms as the smallest unit of elements | these elements themselves]] are composed of [[Fundamental particles of atoms | protons, electrons, and neutrons]], which are rearranged to create elements with distinct properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## Chemistry's Place Among Sciences

Chemistry aims to create and interpret models that describe the universe's complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. It builds upon mathematics, which explores logical ideas independent of observation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Physics, in turn, delves into the most basic constituents of matter and the mathematical properties governing their interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

Chemistry, closely related to physics, utilizes math and physics to explain how different building blocks interact to produce various phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. For example, a chemical equation depicting combustion, where hydrogen reacts with oxygen to release energy, illustrates this interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. These interactions, at the atomic level, are quantum mechanical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

Biology then builds upon chemistry, as all biological processes, including human speech, rely on countless molecular and atomic interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. This hierarchical structure of sciences, from mathematics to physics, chemistry, and biology, provides a framework for understanding our reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

Chemistry offers models to understand interactions at scales and speeds that are not directly observable, allowing for predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. While our knowledge in these fields is still partial, the significant progress made provides a strong foundation for continued discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

[[understanding_the_concept_of_a_chemical_equation | Chemical equations]] are fundamental to [[understanding_chemical_equations | chemistry]], describing [[chemical_reactions_and_equations | reactions]] that occur between substances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. While the concept of [[balancing_chemical_equations | balancing chemical equations]] can initially seem confusing, it can be understood through careful, methodical work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, and is considered an "art" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Understanding a Chemical Equation

A chemical equation illustrates a [[chemical_reactions_and_equations | reaction]] where initial substances, known as [[the_role_of_various_chemical_components_in_equations | reactants]], transform into new substances, called [[the_role_of_various_chemical_components_in_equations | products]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

Consider the example of aluminum reacting with dioxygen:
Aluminum (Al) + Dioxygen (O₂) → Aluminum Oxide (Al₂O₃) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>

In this specific reaction:
*   An atom of aluminum (Al) is combined with a dioxygen molecule (O₂) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   The dioxygen molecule contains two oxygen atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   Under appropriate conditions, these [[the_role_of_various_chemical_components_in_equations | reactants]] form aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   An aluminum oxide molecule consists of two aluminum atoms and three oxygen atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## The Necessity of Balancing Chemical Equations

[[the_process_and_importance_of_balancing_chemical_equations | Balancing chemical equations]] is crucial because atoms cannot simply appear or disappear during a [[chemical_reactions_and_equations | reaction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The number of each type of atom must be identical on both the [[the_role_of_various_chemical_components_in_equations | reactant]] (left-hand) side and the [[the_role_of_various_chemical_components_in_equations | product]] (right-hand) side of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

### Initial Imbalance Example

Using the aluminum and dioxygen reaction as an example:

*   **Aluminum (Al):**
    *   Left-hand side: 1 atom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>
    *   Right-hand side: 2 atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>
    *   *Imbalance: Aluminum atoms do not match.*

*   **Oxygen (O):**
    *   Left-hand side: 2 atoms (in one O₂ molecule) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>
    *   Right-hand side: 3 atoms (in one Al₂O₃ molecule) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>
    *   *Imbalance: Oxygen atoms do not match.*

## [[detailed_examples_of_balancing_chemical_equations | The Process of Balancing]]

To [[balancing_chemical_equations | balance a chemical equation]], coefficients are placed in front of molecules to ensure the number of atoms of each element is equal on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. The convention dictates that coefficients must be whole numbers, avoiding fractions or decimals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This process is similar to solving an algebraic equation, where both sides can be multiplied by a number to eliminate fractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### Step-by-Step Balancing Example

**Original Unbalanced Equation:**
Al + O₂ → Al₂O₃ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>

1.  **Initial Attempt (Balancing Aluminum):**
    To balance aluminum, double the single aluminum atom on the left side:
    2Al + O₂ → Al₂O₃ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>
    *   Now, there are two aluminum atoms on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

2.  **Addressing Oxygen (Initial Fractional Thought):**
    With two oxygen atoms on the left (in O₂) and three on the right (in Al₂O₃), one might consider multiplying O₂ by 1.5 to get three oxygen atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
    2Al + 1.5O₂ → Al₂O₃ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>
    *   This results in 3 oxygen atoms on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
    *   However, "1.5 molecules" is not a standard convention; whole numbers are preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

3.  **Achieving Whole Number Coefficients:**
    To eliminate the 1.5 coefficient, multiply all coefficients in the *entire* equation by 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
    *   (2Al) * 2 = 4Al <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>
    *   (1.5O₂) * 2 = 3O₂ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>
    *   (1Al₂O₃) * 2 = 2Al₂O₃ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>

**Final Balanced Equation:**
4Al + 3O₂ → 2Al₂O₃

### Verification of the Balanced Equation

*   **Aluminum (Al):**
    *   Left-hand side: 4 Al atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>
    *   Right-hand side: 2 Al₂O₃ molecules × 2 Al atoms/molecule = 4 Al atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>
    *   *Balanced.*

*   **Oxygen (O):**
    *   Left-hand side: 3 O₂ molecules × 2 O atoms/molecule = 6 O atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>
    *   Right-hand side: 2 Al₂O₃ molecules × 3 O atoms/molecule = 6 O atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>
    *   *Balanced.*

The equation is now correctly [[balancing_chemical_equations | balanced]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

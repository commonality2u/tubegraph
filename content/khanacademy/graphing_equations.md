There are many ways to [[visual_representation_of_equations | represent]] a [[linear_equations | linear equation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. For example, the equation `y = 2x + 3` can be written in an infinite number of ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. By using [[solving_algebraic_equations | algebraic operations]], such as subtracting `2x` from both sides, it can be rewritten as `-2x + y = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Another equivalent form is `y - 5 = 2(x - 1)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. All these forms are equivalent and can be transformed from one to another using logical [[solving_algebraic_equations | algebraic operations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Introduction to Slope-Intercept Form

One particularly useful way to represent a [[linear_equations | linear equation]] is the **slope-intercept form** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This form explicitly solves for `y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>, typically looking like `y = mx + b`, where `m` and `b` are constants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

## Graphing a Linear Equation (y = 2x + 3)

To [[visual_representation_of_equations | graph]] a [[linear_equations | linear equation]], points can be plotted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. For the equation `y = 2x + 3`:

### Identifying the Y-intercept

When `x = 0`, `y = 2(0) + 3`, which simplifies to `y = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This gives the point `(0, 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This point is on the y-axis, and thus it is the **y-intercept** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. In slope-intercept form, the constant term (in this case, `3`) directly indicates the y-intercept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### Identifying the Slope

The slope of a [[linear_equations | linear equation]] describes the steepness and direction of the line. It is defined as the change in `y` (delta y) divided by the change in `x` (delta x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

Consider the equation `y = 2x + 3`:
*   If `x` increases by `1` (delta `x` = `1`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>:
    *   When `x = 0`, `y = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
    *   When `x = 1`, `y = 2(1) + 3 = 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
    *   The change in `y` (delta `y`) is `5 - 3 = 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   If `x` increases by another `1` (delta `x` = `1`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>:
    *   When `x = 2`, `y = 2(2) + 3 = 7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
    *   The change in `y` (delta `y`) is `7 - 5 = 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

For this [[linear_equations | linear equation]], the change in `y` is always `2` when the change in `x` is `1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Therefore, the slope (change in `y` / change in `x`) is `2/1 = 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. In the slope-intercept form (`y = 2x + 3`), the coefficient of `x` (which is `2`) directly represents the slope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. This means for every unit increase in `x`, `y` increases by `2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

A line is defined by just two points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. Using the y-intercept `(0, 3)` and another point like `(1, 5)` (derived from the slope), the line `y = 2x + 3` can be drawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## Another Example (y = -x + 2)

Consider another [[linear_equations | linear equation]] in slope-intercept form: `y = -x + 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   **Y-intercept**: The y-intercept is `2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>, meaning the line crosses the y-axis at `(0, 2)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   **Slope**: The coefficient of `x` is `-1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. This means the slope is `-1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. For every unit increase in `x`, `y` decreases by `1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

The slope-intercept form (`y = mx + b`) makes it very easy to determine both the y-intercept (`b`) and the slope (`m`) of a [[linear_equations | linear equation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

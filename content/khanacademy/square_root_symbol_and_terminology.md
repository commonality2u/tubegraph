The term "radical" refers to the square root symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, which is more commonly known as the square root symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Simplifying Radicals

To [[simplifying_radicals | simplify a radical]] means to reduce the expression under the radical sign as much as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

For example:
*   The square root of 36 is 6, because 6 multiplied by itself equals 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Connection to Exponent Rules

The square root of a number is the same as raising that number to the 1/2 power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This concept is an extension of [[exponent_rules_and_radicals | exponent rules]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, specifically that for two numbers multiplied together and raised to a power, each number can be raised to that power and then multiplied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

Therefore, the square root of a product (e.g., the square root of 36 times 2) can be expressed as the product of the square roots (e.g., the square root of 36 times the square root of 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### Technique for Simplification

The key to [[simplifying_radicals | simplifying radicals]] is to find the largest factor of the number under the radical sign that is a [[perfect_squares_and_their_identification | perfect square]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Common [[perfect_squares_and_their_identification | perfect squares]] include 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, and so on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. If any of these are factors, they can be factored out and their square root taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

## Examples of Simplifying Radicals

*   **Simplifying $\sqrt{72}$**
    *   72 can be factored as 36 x 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
    *   $\sqrt{72} = \sqrt{36 \times 2}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>
    *   Using the exponent rule, this is equivalent to $\sqrt{36} \times \sqrt{2}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
    *   Since $\sqrt{36} = 6$, the simplified form is $6\sqrt{2}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

*   **Simplifying $\sqrt{50}$**
    *   50 can be factored as 25 x 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
    *   $\sqrt{50} = \sqrt{25 \times 2} = \sqrt{25} \times \sqrt{2}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
    *   Since $\sqrt{25} = 5$, the simplified form is $5\sqrt{2}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
    *   The factor 25 was chosen because it is the largest [[perfect_squares_and_their_identification | perfect square]] factor of 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

*   **Simplifying $7\sqrt{27}$**
    *   27 can be factored as 9 x 3, where 9 is a [[perfect_squares_and_their_identification | perfect square]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
    *   $7\sqrt{27} = 7 \times \sqrt{9 \times 3}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>
    *   This equals $7 \times \sqrt{9} \times \sqrt{3}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
    *   Since $\sqrt{9} = 3$, the expression becomes $7 \times 3 \times \sqrt{3} = 21\sqrt{3}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

*   **Simplifying $9\sqrt{18}$**
    *   18 can be factored as 2 x 9, where 9 is a [[perfect_squares_and_their_identification | perfect square]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
    *   $9\sqrt{18} = 9 \times \sqrt{2 \times 9}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>
    *   This equals $9 \times \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{9}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
    *   Since $\sqrt{9} = 3$, the expression becomes $9 \times \sqrt{2} \times 3 = 27\sqrt{2}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

*   **Simplifying $4\sqrt{25}$**
    *   25 is itself a [[perfect_squares_and_their_identification | perfect square]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
    *   $\sqrt{25} = 5$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
    *   So, $4\sqrt{25} = 4 \times 5 = 20$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

*   **Simplifying $3\sqrt{29}$**
    *   29 is a prime number and only has factors 1 and 29 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
    *   Neither 1 nor 29 are [[perfect_squares_and_their_identification | perfect squares]] (other than 1, which doesn't simplify further) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
    *   Therefore, $3\sqrt{29}$ is already in its completely simplified form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

*   **Simplifying $7\sqrt{320}$ (Multi-step)**
    *   For larger numbers, [[simplifying_radicals | simplification]] can be done in multiple steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
    *   First, identify a [[perfect_squares_and_their_identification | perfect square]] factor. For 320, 16 is a factor (320 = 16 x 20) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
    *   $7\sqrt{320} = 7 \times \sqrt{16 \times 20} = 7 \times \sqrt{16} \times \sqrt{20}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
    *   Since $\sqrt{16} = 4$, this becomes $7 \times 4 \times \sqrt{20} = 28\sqrt{20}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
    *   Next, check if 20 can be further simplified. 20 can be factored as 4 x 5, where 4 is a [[perfect_squares_and_their_identification | perfect square]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
    *   $28\sqrt{20} = 28 \times \sqrt{4 \times 5} = 28 \times \sqrt{4} \times \sqrt{5}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
    *   Since $\sqrt{4} = 2$, this becomes $28 \times 2 \times \sqrt{5} = 56\sqrt{5}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
    *   The process continues until the number under the radical cannot be divided by any more [[perfect_squares_and_their_identification | perfect squares]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. For 320, the largest [[perfect_squares_and_their_identification | perfect square]] factor is 64 (64 x 5 = 320), but it's acceptable to do it in steps if not immediately obvious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

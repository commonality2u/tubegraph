From: [[khanacademy]] <br/> 

The word "[[introduction_to_algebra | algebra]]" and the fundamental ideas it represents today originate from a pivotal book written by a Persian mathematician named al-Khwarizmi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Al-Khwarizmi lived in Baghdad around the 8th or 9th century, specifically writing this significant work in 820 AD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## The "Compendious Book"

The English translation of the book's title is "Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The term "[[introduction_to_algebra | algebra]]" itself is an Arabic word, and it appears in the book's original Arabic title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

### Etymology of "Algebra"

The Arabic word "algebra" means "restoration" or "completion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Al-Khwarizmi associated this term with the operation of moving a term from one side of an [[understanding_equality_in_algebra | equation]] to the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

The full Arabic title of the book, *Al-Kitāb al-mukhtaṣar fī ḥisāb al-jabr wa’l-muqābala*, can be broken down:
*   **Al-Kitāb**: "The Book" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>
*   **al-mukhtaṣar**: "Compendious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>
*   **fī ḥisāb**: "on Calculation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>
*   **al-jabr**: "Completion" or "Restoration" (the root of "[[introduction_to_algebra | algebra]]") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>
*   **wa’l-muqābala**: "and Balancing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>

## Al-Khwarizmi's Contributions

Al-Khwarizmi's book is highly significant, not only for introducing the word "[[introduction_to_algebra | algebra]]" but also because many historians consider it the foundational text where [[introduction_to_algebra | algebra]] began to adopt its modern characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. These characteristics include the [[understanding_equality_in_algebra | idea of balancing an equation]] and thinking about mathematical problems in an abstract sense, rather than as isolated, specific problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. He is sometimes regarded as a "father of [[introduction_to_algebra | algebra]]" for pioneering this abstract approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

## Historical Context

While al-Khwarizmi's work is a landmark in the [[role_of_civilization_in_the_evolution_of_algebra | history of algebra]], he was not the first to explore algebraic ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. The [[historical_development_of_algebra | historical development of algebra]] traces back much further.

The earliest known records of algebraic thought come from ancient Babylon, around 2000 BCE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Stone tablets from this period demonstrate people working with fundamental algebraic concepts, even if they used different symbols and methods of representation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Babylon was part of Mesopotamia, a region often appearing in the [[role_of_civilization_in_the_evolution_of_algebra | history of algebra]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

Other [[significant_contributions_to_algebra_by_various_cultures | major contributions to algebra]] before al-Khwarizmi include:

*   **Diophantus (c. 200-300 AD)**: A Greek mathematician from Alexandria, sometimes credited as the "father of [[introduction_to_algebra | algebra]]" by Western historians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. His work focused more on particular problems compared to al-Khwarizmi's abstract approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   **Brahmagupta (c. 600 AD)**: A famous mathematician from India who also made significant contributions to the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

These figures, along with al-Khwarizmi, each made unique contributions to what we now understand as [[introduction_to_algebra | algebra]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

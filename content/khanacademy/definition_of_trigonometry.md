[[basics_of_trigonometry | Basic trigonometry]] is the study of [[right_triangles_and_trigonometry | right triangles and the relationship between the sides and the angles of a right triangle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. It helps understand what calculator buttons like "sine," "cosine," and "tangent" do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Etymology
The term "trigonometry" is believed to originate from Ancient Greek, meaning "triangle measure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Core Concepts
Trigonometric functions relate the angles of a right triangle to the [[trigonometric_ratios_and_angle_identification | ratios of the sides of the triangle are relative to that angle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. For any given angle (often denoted as theta), these functions provide specific side ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Identifying Sides in a Right Triangle
When working with an angle (e.g., theta) in a right triangle:
*   **Opposite Side:** The side directly across from the angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   **Hypotenuse:** The longest side of the triangle, always opposite the right angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Adjacent Side:** The side next to the angle that is not the hypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

### Core Trigonometric Functions
The three primary [[core_trigonometric_functions_sine_cosine_and_tangent | trigonometric functions]] are sine, cosine, and tangent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

#### SOH CAH TOA Mnemonic
A helpful [[mnemonic_device_for_remembering_trigonometric_functions | mnemonic]] to remember the definitions of these functions is [[trigonometric_ratios_and_soh_cah_toa_mnemonic | SOH CAH TOA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **SOH**: **S**ine = **O**pposite / **H**ypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>
    *   Example: For an angle theta in a 3-4-5 right triangle, if the opposite side is 4 and the hypotenuse is 5, then sine(theta) = 4/5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **CAH**: **C**osine = **A**djacent / **H**ypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>
    *   Example: For the same angle theta, if the adjacent side is 3 and the hypotenuse is 5, then cosine(theta) = 3/5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   **TOA**: **T**angent = **O**pposite / **A**djacent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>
    *   Example: For the same angle theta, if the opposite side is 4 and the adjacent side is 3, then tangent(theta) = 4/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

It is important to note that the values of the [[introduction_to_basic_trigonometric_functions | trig functions]] depend on which angle of the right triangle is being used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. For example, if a different angle (e.g., x) in the same 3-4-5 triangle is used, the tangent(x) would be 3/4, which is the inverse of tangent(theta) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

## Practical Applications
Trigonometry allows for solving unknown aspects of a triangle. If you know an angle and a side, or a couple of sides, you can use a calculator or trig table to determine unknown angles or other sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. These [[practical_applications_of_trigonometry | practical applications]] will be explored further in subsequent modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

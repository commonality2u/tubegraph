[[fermentation_and_anaerobic_respiration | Fermentation]] is a process that occurs when oxygen is not present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. It serves as an alternative pathway following [[glycolysis | glycolysis]] when oxygen is unavailable for the subsequent steps of cellular respiration, such as the [[krebs_cycle | Krebs cycle]] and the [[electron_transport_chain_and_atp_production | electron transport chain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Products of Fermentation

The specific end products of [[fermentation_and_anaerobic_respiration | fermentation]] depend on the type of organism performing the process:
*   **In humans**, [[fermentation_and_anaerobic_respiration | fermentation]] results in the production of lactic acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   **In other organisms**, [[fermentation_and_anaerobic_respiration | fermentation]] might produce alcohol or ethanol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

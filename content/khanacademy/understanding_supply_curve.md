In economics, the supply curve illustrates the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity producers are willing to supply to the [[apple_market_supply_and_demand | market]] at different price points over a specific period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Graphing the Supply Curve

To visualize the supply curve, a graph is used where:
*   The vertical axis represents the price per pound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   The horizontal axis represents the quantity of apples in thousands of pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

The supply curve typically has an upward [[slope_of_a_curve | slope]], indicating that as the price of apples increases, producers are willing to supply a greater quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. For example, at a price of $1, suppliers might be willing to supply about 1,000 pounds, but if the price increased, the quantity they are willing to supply would also increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

### Quantity Supplied vs. Supply Curve

It's important to distinguish between "quantity supplied" and the "supply curve":
*   **Quantity Supplied** refers to the specific amount of a good producers are willing to sell at a particular price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   The **Supply Curve** represents the entire relationship between various prices and the quantities producers are willing to supply at those prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## Market Dynamics and the Supply Curve

The supply curve, along with the [[understanding_demand_curve | demand curve]], helps explain market behavior.

### Shortage Scenario

If the initial price set by suppliers is too low (e.g., $1 per pound), the quantity supplied (1,000 pounds) will be less than the [[impact_of_price_changes_on_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] (4,000 pounds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This creates a [[shortages_and_surpluses_in_markets | shortage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. In response to a shortage, prices tend to rise as consumers bid them up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. As prices go up, suppliers are incentivized to increase the quantity they produce, moving upwards along the supply curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

### Surplus Scenario

Conversely, if suppliers set the price too high (e.g., $3 per pound), the quantity supplied (3,000 pounds) will exceed the [[impact_of_price_changes_on_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] (1,300 pounds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. This results in a [[shortages_and_surpluses_in_markets | surplus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. To sell their excess goods, producers might start reducing prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. As prices decrease, suppliers are likely to reduce the quantity they produce, moving downwards along the supply curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

### Equilibrium

The interaction between the supply curve and the [[graphing_the_demand_curve | demand curve]] leads to an **equilibrium point** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. This is the price at which the quantity supplied by producers exactly equals the [[impact_of_price_changes_on_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] by consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. At this **equilibrium price** (e.g., $2.15 per pound for apples), there is no [[shortages_and_surpluses_in_markets | shortage]] or [[shortages_and_surpluses_in_markets | surplus]], ensuring that all goods produced are sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. The corresponding quantity at this point is the **equilibrium quantity** (e.g., 2,200 pounds of apples) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

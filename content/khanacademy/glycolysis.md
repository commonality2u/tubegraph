[[overview_of_glycolysis | Glycolysis]] is the first stage of [[cellular_respiration | cellular respiration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>, a biochemical reaction crucial for deriving energy from fuel like glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This process literally means "breaking up glucose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, with "glyco" referring to glucose and "lysis" meaning to break up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

## Process of Glycolysis
[[glycolysis_process | Glycolysis]] involves breaking down a 6-carbon glucose molecule into two 3-carbon molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. These 3-carbon molecules are known as pyruvate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Glucose, a sugar, is indeed sweet, and all sugars typically end with the suffix "-ose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

## Energy and Byproduct Production
In terms of [[atp_production_and_consumption_in_glycolysis | ATP production]], [[glycolysis_process_and_outcomes | glycolysis]] requires two ATPs and generates four ATPs, resulting in a net gain of two ATPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

Beyond direct ATP production, [[glycolysis_process | glycolysis]] also plays a significant role in [[reduction_of_nad_to_nadh_in_glycolysis | producing NADH]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. In this stage, NAD+ is converted to NADH by adding hydrogens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. These NADHs are crucial because they later drive the electron transport chain, which produces the majority of ATP in [[cellular_respiration | cellular respiration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

## Oxygen Requirement (Anaerobic Process)
A key characteristic of [[glycolysis_process | glycolysis]] is that it does not require oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. It can occur whether oxygen is present or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>, classifying it as an anaerobic process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

## Glycolysis and Fermentation
When oxygen is scarce, the byproducts of [[glycolysis_process | glycolysis]] (pyruvate) cannot proceed into the [[krebs_cycle_and_pyruvate_oxidation | Krebs Cycle]] and electron transport chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>, as these subsequent stages are aerobic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. Instead, these byproducts enter a side process called fermentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. For humans and other mammals, this results in lactic acid fermentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>, leading to muscle ache if oxygen supply is insufficient during intense activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. In some organisms like yeast, alcohol fermentation occurs, producing alcohol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

## Phases of Glycolysis
The process of [[glycolysis_process | glycolysis]] can be conceptually divided into [[investment_and_payoff_phases_of_glycolysis | investment and payoff phases]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. The investment phase consumes ATP, while the payoff phase generates ATP. The overall outcome is a net production of ATP and NADH molecules.

## Role of Enzymes
Although not explicitly detailed in the provided transcript, the process of glycolysis, like other biochemical reactions, is highly dependent on the [[role_of_enzymes_in_glycolysis | action of enzymes]] to catalyze each step.

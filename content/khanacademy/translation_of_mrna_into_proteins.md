[[Gene expression and its significance | Gene expression]] involves taking genetic information from DNA and converting it into functional products, primarily proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. The final step in this process is **translation**, where the genetic code carried by messenger RNA (mRNA) is used to synthesize proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

## The Role of mRNA

After transcription, an mRNA molecule carries the genetic information from a specific gene out of the cell's nucleus (in eukaryotic cells) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. This mRNA strand then serves as a template for protein synthesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

## Codons

The information on the mRNA molecule is read in sequences of three bases, known as **codons** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. Each codon specifies a particular amino acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.
*   There are four possible bases in RNA (Adenine, Uracil, Cytosine, Guanine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.
*   Since each codon consists of three bases, there are 4 x 4 x 4 = 64 possible codon combinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.
*   These 64 codons code for 20 different amino acids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. This redundancy means that more than one codon can code for the same amino acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

## The Process of Translation

### Ribosomes
The mRNA strand attaches to a [[structure_and_function_of_ribosomes | ribosome]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Ribosomes are cellular machines responsible for synthesizing proteins by reading the mRNA codons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

### Transfer RNA (tRNA)
Another type of RNA, called transfer RNA (tRNA), plays a crucial role in bringing the correct amino acids to the [[structure_and_function_of_ribosomes | ribosome]] according to the mRNA sequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. Each tRNA molecule has a specific anticodon that can base-pair with a complementary mRNA codon, and it carries the corresponding amino acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. This ensures that amino acids are added in the correct order to form the protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

As the [[structure_and_function_of_ribosomes | ribosome]] moves along the mRNA, tRNAs deliver their amino acids, which are then linked together to form a polypeptide chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.

## Proteins: The Products of Translation

Proteins are formed by long sequences of amino acids joined together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. These chains can be thousands or more amino acids long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. They fold into complex three-dimensional shapes, which dictate their specific functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. Proteins are essential molecules that perform the majority of functions in living organisms, acting as enzymes, providing structural support (e.g., muscle tissue), and carrying out various other cellular processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. This entire process, from DNA to RNA to protein, represents how the information for life is stored and expressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

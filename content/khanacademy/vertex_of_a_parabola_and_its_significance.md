The vertex of a parabola is a critical point that helps in [[graphing_quadratic_functions_and_identifying_their_parabolic_shape | graphing quadratic functions]] and understanding their properties, particularly the function's [[understanding_the_range_of_a_quadratic_function | range]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Identifying the Vertex

A quadratic function, such as `f(x) = 3x^2 + 6x - 2`, has a parabolic shape when graphed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. This parabola will either open upwards or downwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. The vertex is the turning point of this parabola.

There are several ways to determine the vertex:
*   **Graphical Inspection**: By plotting points and observing the [[analyzing_symmetry_in_parabolic_graphs | symmetry]] of the graph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Using a Formula**: The x-coordinate of the vertex for a quadratic function in the standard form `ax^2 + bx + c` can be directly computed using the formula `x = -b / (2a)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This formula is derived directly from the [[introduction_to_the_quadratic_formula | quadratic formula]], which itself is obtained by [[completing_the_square_and_derivation_of_the_quadratic_formula | completing the square]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### Example: Finding the Vertex for `f(x) = 3x^2 + 6x - 2`

Let's find the vertex for the function `f(x) = 3x^2 + 6x - 2` using the formula `x = -b / (2a)`:
*   Here, `a = 3` and `b = 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   The x-coordinate of the vertex is `x = -6 / (2 * 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   `x = -6 / 6 = -1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   To find the y-coordinate of the vertex, substitute `x = -1` into the function:
    *   `f(-1) = 3(-1)^2 + 6(-1) - 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>
    *   `f(-1) = 3(1) - 6 - 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>
    *   `f(-1) = 3 - 6 - 2 = -3 - 2 = -5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>
*   Therefore, the vertex of this parabola is at the point `(-1, -5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Significance of the Vertex

The vertex holds significant importance for understanding a quadratic function:

1.  **Minimum or Maximum Point**:
    *   For an **upward-opening parabola** (when `a > 0`), the vertex represents the absolute minimum point of the function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, meaning the function will not take on any values below its y-coordinate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. In the example `f(x) = 3x^2 + 6x - 2`, since `a=3` (which is positive), the parabola opens upwards, and the vertex `(-1, -5)` is its minimum point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
    *   For a **downward-opening parabola** (when `a < 0`), the vertex represents the absolute maximum point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

2.  **Defining the Range**: The y-coordinate of the vertex directly determines the boundary for the function's [[understanding_the_range_of_a_quadratic_function | range]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
    *   For `f(x) = 3x^2 + 6x - 2`, the vertex is at `(-1, -5)`. Since it's an upward-opening parabola, the lowest y-value the function can achieve is -5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. As x moves away from the vertex (either to the left or right), the y-values increase indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
    *   Thus, the [[understanding_the_range_of_a_quadratic_function | range]] of `f(x)` is all real numbers greater than or equal to -5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

3.  **Axis of [[analyzing_symmetry_in_parabolic_graphs | Symmetry]]**: The vertical line passing through the vertex acts as the axis of [[analyzing_symmetry_in_parabolic_graphs | symmetry]] for the parabola <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Points on the parabola equidistant from this line will have the same y-value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. For `f(x) = 3x^2 + 6x - 2`, the axis of [[analyzing_symmetry_in_parabolic_graphs | symmetry]] is `x = -1`.
    *   For example, when `x = -2` (one unit to the left of `x = -1`), `f(x) = -2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
    *   When `x = 0` (one unit to the right of `x = -1`), `f(x) = -2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

### Graphing the Example Function

Plotting the points derived from the vertex and its [[analyzing_symmetry_in_parabolic_graphs | symmetry]] helps visualize the parabola:

*   Vertex: `(-1, -5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>
*   Point: `(-2, -2)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>
*   Point: `(0, -2)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>
*   Point: `(1, 7)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>

These points clearly illustrate the upward-opening parabolic shape and the minimum point at the vertex, confirming the [[understanding_the_range_of_a_quadratic_function | range]] to be `y â‰¥ -5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> The [[understanding_the_domain_of_a_quadratic_function | domain]] of any standard quadratic function `f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c` is always all real numbers, as any real number can be an input `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The concept of imaginary or complex numbers, while existing, is typically not considered when discussing the [[understanding_the_domain_of_a_quadratic_function | domain]] in this context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

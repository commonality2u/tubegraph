The mean is a fundamental statistical concept, representing one way to measure the average or [[central_tendency | central tendency]] of a dataset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. It is a key component in understanding data distribution and is frequently used, especially when discussing concepts like variance and standard deviation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Other Measures of Central Tendency

While the mean is widely used, other [[measures_of_central_tendency | measures of central tendency]] include the [[mean_median_and_mode | median]] and the [[mean_median_and_mode | mode]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The mean, however, tends to appear more often in statistical discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Calculating the Mean

The method for [[calculating_the_mean | calculating the mean]] is similar for both a population and a sample, though different notation is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Essentially, it involves summing all data points and dividing by the total number of data points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### Population Mean

For a population, the mean is denoted by the Greek letter mu (μ) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
The formula for the population mean is:
μ = (Σxᵢ) / N <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>
Where:
*   Σxᵢ is the sum of each data point (from the first to the Nth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>
*   N is the total number of data points in the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>

### Sample Mean

For a sample, the mean is denoted as x with a line on top (x̄) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
The formula for the sample mean is:
x̄ = (Σxᵢ) / n <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>
Where:
*   Σxᵢ is the sum of all data points in the sample <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>
*   n is the total number of data points in the sample (assuming n < N) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>

## Example Calculation: Population Mean

Consider a population with the following numbers: 1, 2, 3, 8, 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

1.  **Sum the data points**:
    1 + 2 + 3 + 8 + 7 = 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>
2.  **Count the number of data points (N)**:
    There are 5 data points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
3.  **Calculate the mean**:
    μ = 21 / 5 = 4.20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>

Therefore, the mean of this population is 4.20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

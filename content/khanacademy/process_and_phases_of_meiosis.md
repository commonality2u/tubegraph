Meiosis is a distinct process of cell division that occurs in two main phases, ultimately leading to the production of gametes or sex cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

## Starting Point
Meiosis begins with a cell that has a diploid (2n) number of chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. For human beings, this means starting with 46 chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. Before the first phase of meiosis, the cell undergoes interphase, where it replicates its DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

## Meiosis One
The first major phase is called [[detailed_cell_division_process_in_meiosis | Meiosis One]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>.
*   **Result**: Meiosis One produces two cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.
*   **Chromosome Number**: Each of these resulting cells has a haploid (n) number of chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>, meaning the chromosome number is halved from diploid to haploid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. For humans, the original 46 chromosomes become 23 in each nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
*   **Genetic Information**: During this phase, homologous pairs of chromosomes are split <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>, and they split randomly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. As a result, the two cells may not necessarily have the same genetic information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.

## Meiosis Two
Following [[detailed_cell_division_process_in_meiosis | Meiosis One]], each of the two haploid cells goes through [[detailed_cell_division_process_in_meiosis | Meiosis Two]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.
*   **Similarity to Mitosis**: This phase is very similar to [[process_and_phases_of_mitosis | mitosis]], but it starts with cells that already have a haploid number of chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.
*   **Result**: [[detailed_cell_division_process_in_meiosis | Meiosis Two]] duplicates each haploid cell into two, resulting in a total of four cells, each containing the haploid number of chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.

## Outcome and Purpose
*   **Gametes**: The four cells produced by meiosis are called gametes, or sex cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.
*   **Not a Cycle**: Unlike [[process_and_phases_of_mitosis | mitosis]], meiosis is not a cycle; these resulting gametes do not typically re-enter the cell cycle for further division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.
*   **Fertilization**: These gametes are specifically used for fertilization in [[role_of_meiosis_in_sexual_reproduction | sexual reproduction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>. For example, in males, these are sperm cells (produced in the testes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>, and in females, they are egg cells (produced in the ovaries) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.
*   **New Organism**: When gametes from different organisms fuse during fertilization, they form a fertilized egg, which can then undergo [[process_and_phases_of_mitosis | mitosis]] to create an entirely new organism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.

## Location in the Body
Meiosis takes place in germ cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>. In males, this occurs in the testes, and in females, it occurs in the ovaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>. Germ cells themselves can also undergo [[process_and_phases_of_mitosis | mitosis]] to produce more diploid germ cells, or they can undergo meiosis to produce sperm or egg cells (gametes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.

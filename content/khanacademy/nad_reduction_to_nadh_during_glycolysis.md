[[overview_of_glycolysis | Glycolysis]] is the initial phase of [[glycolysis_and_its_role_in_cellular_respiration | cellular respiration]], literally meaning the breaking down of glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. This process can occur with or without oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. If oxygen is present, [[impact_of_glycolysis_in_cellular_respiration | glycolysis]] is followed by the Krebs cycle and the [[role_of_nadh_and_fadh2_in_electron_transport_chain | electron transport chain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>, where the bulk of ATP is produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

## Glycolysis Overview
[[functional_steps_and_enzymes_involved_in_glycolysis | Glycolysis]] begins with glucose (C6H12O6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. It proceeds through two main phases:
1.  **[[atp_investment_and_payoff_phases_in_glycolysis | Investment Phase]]**: This phase uses two ATP molecules to break glucose into two 3-carbon compounds, often referred to as PGAL or phosphoglyceraldehyde <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.
2.  **[[atp_investment_and_payoff_phases_in_glycolysis | Payoff Phase]]**: Each of the two PGAL molecules is converted into pyruvate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. This phase generates ATP and NADH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.

## [[role_of_nad_and_nadh_in_glycolysis | Role of NAD+ and NADH]]
During the [[atp_investment_and_payoff_phases_in_glycolysis | payoff phase]] of [[functional_steps_and_enzymes_involved_in_glycolysis | glycolysis]], an important coenzyme called NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) plays a crucial role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.

### NAD+ Reduction
For each of the two PGAL molecules that transform into pyruvate, one NAD+ molecule is reduced to NADH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. This reduction involves the NAD+ molecule gaining a hydrogen atom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>. In a biological context, reduction often implies gaining hydrogen, as hydrogen is non-electronegative and allows for the gaining of electrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>.

### Net Production and Future Use
For every molecule of glucose that enters [[overall_equation_and_net_energy_yield_of_glycolysis | glycolysis]], two NAD+ molecules are consumed and two NADH molecules are produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>. These NADH molecules are vital because they serve as raw materials for the subsequent stage of [[glycolysis_and_its_role_in_cellular_respiration | cellular respiration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. Later, these NADHs are used in the [[role_of_nadh_and_fadh2_in_electron_transport_chain | electron transport chain]] to generate more ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.

### Summary of Glycolysis Products
From one glucose molecule, [[overall_equation_and_net_energy_yield_of_glycolysis | glycolysis]] yields:
*   Two molecules of pyruvate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>
*   A net gain of two [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATP]] molecules (four produced, two invested) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>
*   Two molecules of NADH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>
    > "You get two NADHs that can each later be used in the [[role_of_nadh_and_fadh2_in_electron_transport_chain | electron transport chain]] to produce three ATPs." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>

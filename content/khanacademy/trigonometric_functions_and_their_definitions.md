[[Introduction to trigonometry | Trigonometry]], originating from Ancient Greek, translates to "triangle measure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. It is fundamentally the study of [[right_triangles_and_their_properties | right triangles]] and the relationship between their sides and angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. [[Basic trigonometric functions sine cosine and tangent | Trigonometric functions]] explain the ratios of a triangle's sides relative to a specific angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Key Trigonometric Functions
The three primary [[basic_trigonometric_functions_sine_cosine_and_tangent | basic trigonometric functions]] are sine (sin), cosine (cos), and tangent (tan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. These functions correspond to buttons often found on calculators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

### The SOHCAHTOA Mnemonic
To remember the definitions of these functions, the mnemonic [[sohcahtoa_mnemonic_for_trigonometric_functions | SOHCAHTOA]] is commonly used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

*   **SOH**: **S**ine = **O**pposite / **H**ypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>
*   **CAH**: **C**osine = **A**djacent / **H**ypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>
*   **TOA**: **T**angent = **O**pposite / **A**djacent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>

In a [[right_triangles_and_their_properties | right triangle]]:
*   The **opposite** side is the side directly across from the chosen angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   The **adjacent** side is the side next to the chosen angle that is not the hypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   The **hypotenuse** is always the longest side, located opposite the right angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

### [[Examples of calculating sine cosine and tangent | Calculating Trigonometric Functions]]

Consider a [[right_triangles_and_their_properties | right triangle]] with sides 3, 4, and a hypotenuse of 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Let's denote one of the acute angles as theta (θ) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, where the side of length 4 is opposite theta, and the side of length 3 is adjacent to theta.

*   **Sine of theta (sin θ)**
    *   Using SOH (Opposite/Hypotenuse):
    *   The side opposite theta is 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
    *   The hypotenuse is 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
    *   Therefore, sin θ = 4/5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

*   **Cosine of theta (cos θ)**
    *   Using CAH (Adjacent/Hypotenuse):
    *   The side adjacent to theta is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
    *   The hypotenuse is 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
    *   Therefore, cos θ = 3/5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

*   **Tangent of theta (tan θ)**
    *   Using TOA (Opposite/Adjacent):
    *   The side opposite theta is 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
    *   The side adjacent to theta is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
    *   Therefore, tan θ = 4/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

### [[Applying trigonometry to different angles in a triangle | Impact of Reference Angle]]
The values of the [[calculating_trigonometric_functions_sine_cosine_tangent | trigonometric functions]] depend on which angle in the [[right_triangles_and_their_properties | right triangle]] is chosen as the reference angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

Let's consider the other acute angle in the same triangle, labeled as 'x' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
*   **Tangent of x (tan x)**
    *   For angle x, the opposite side is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
    *   The adjacent side for angle x is 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
    *   Therefore, tan x = 3/4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
    *   Notice that tan x (3/4) is the inverse of tan θ (4/3) in this specific example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

## [[Application of trigonometry in right triangles | Practical Applications]]
[[Application of trigonometry in right triangles | Trigonometry]] allows for the calculation of unknown sides or angles of a [[right_triangles_and_their_properties | right triangle]] if sufficient information (e.g., an angle and a side, or two sides) is known, typically with the aid of a calculator or trigonometric tables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This capability is explored further in subsequent discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

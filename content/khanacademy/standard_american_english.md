The grammar videos on Khan Academy focus specifically on [[Standard American English | Standard American English]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.

## Approach to Teaching English

The instruction emphasizes that there are "many Englishes," and all of them are considered "great," "wonderful," "vibrant," "important," and "special" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. The goal of these videos is not to teach what is "right" or "wrong" in terms of English usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. Instead, the purpose is to provide tools to "harness language" and "harness English" so that learners can use it in any way they desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.

This teaching philosophy is likened to ensuring a car's "wheels are on straight" rather than dictating the car's color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. This means the focus is on the fundamental aspects that make language understandable, rather than on prescriptive stylistic choices specific to [[Standard American English | Standard American English]] or any other dialect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

Grammar itself is defined as a set of conventions and rules that govern language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. A "rule" represents the bare minimum for language to be understandable by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. A "convention," on the other hand, is a generally accepted practice that is not strictly necessary for understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. Grammar is also [[contextdependent_grammar | context dependent]], meaning the type of grammar used varies depending on who is being addressed, what is being communicated, and how it is being expressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.

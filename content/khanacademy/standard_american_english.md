**Standard American English** refers to a very specific kind of grammar that is the focus of these videos on Khan Academy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38">[01:38]</a>.

## What is Grammar?
Grammar is defined as a set of [[difference_between_conventions_and_rules_in_grammar | conventions and rules]] that govern language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18">[00:18]</a>.
*   A [[difference_between_conventions_and_rules_in_grammar | rule]] represents the bare minimum required to make language understandable to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26">[00:26]</a>. For example, a rule ensures that a car's wheels are on the bottom for it to move as intended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34">[00:34]</a>.
*   A [[difference_between_conventions_and_rules_in_grammar | convention]] is comparable to the idea that all cars should be painted tealâ€”it's not necessarily true or essential for function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46">[00:46]</a>.

## Context-Dependent Nature of Grammar
Grammar is context-dependent, meaning the type of grammar used varies depending on who is being addressed, what is being said, and how it's being communicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54">[00:54]</a>. Individuals utilize multiple forms of grammar throughout their daily lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07">[01:07]</a>.

## Learning Approach
These videos aim to give names to the grammatical concepts that viewers already know from living and interacting in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11">[01:11]</a>. The purpose is to enhance one's command of language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34">[01:34]</a>.

### Plurality of Englishes
It is important to acknowledge that there are "many englishes," all of which are considered great, wonderful, vibrant, important, and special <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45">[01:45]</a>. The instruction does not seek to dictate what is "right" or "wrong" in English; rather, it aims to provide tools to harness English and use it in any desired way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53">[01:53]</a>. The focus is on ensuring the "wheels are on straight," meaning language is understandable, rather than on arbitrary conventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27">[02:27]</a>.

Anyone who has engaged in speaking and reading throughout their life has already made a study of grammar and is considered a grammarian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30">[02:30]</a>.

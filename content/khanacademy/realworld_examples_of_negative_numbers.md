Initially, [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negative numbers]] might appear "deep and mysterious" when first encountered, especially since initial counting focuses on positive numbers [00:00:09]. However, they are commonly present in everyday life [00:00:17]. Generally, a negative number is defined as any number less than zero [00:00:26].

## Common Contexts for Negative Numbers

### Temperature
Negative numbers are frequently used when measuring temperature, whether in Celsius or Fahrenheit [00:00:42]. For example, if the temperature is 3 degrees Celsius and it is predicted to get 4 degrees colder:
*   Dropping 1 degree would make it 2 degrees [00:01:21].
*   Dropping 2 degrees would make it 1 degree [00:01:26].
*   Dropping 3 degrees would bring it to 0 degrees [00:01:31].
*   To get 4 degrees colder, the temperature must go one more degree below 0, which is represented as [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negative 1]] degree Celsius [00:01:38].

On a [[visualizing_negative_numbers_on_a_number_line | number line]], values increase as you move to the right of zero, and decrease as you move to the left [00:01:52]. This means that [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negative 3]] is less than [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negative 1]], signifying colder temperatures [00:02:12]. Similarly, [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negative 100]] degrees is much smaller and represents significantly less heat than [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negative 1]] degree [00:02:27].

### Bank Account Balance
Negative numbers also represent debt or an amount owed, such as in a bank account [00:03:37]. If one has $10 in a bank account but spends $30, assuming the bank allows for overspending, the account will have a [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negative]] balance [00:03:03]. The $20 difference comes from the bank, meaning one would owe the bank $20 [00:03:49]. This is expressed as having [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negative $20]] in the account [00:04:02].

This scenario can be visualized on a [[visualizing_negative_numbers_on_a_number_line | number line]]:
*   Starting at $10 [00:04:39].
*   Spending $30 means moving 30 spaces to the left [00:04:42].
*   Moving 10 spaces left reaches $0 [00:04:47].
*   Moving another 10 spaces left reaches [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negative $10]] [00:04:52].
*   Moving a final 10 spaces left (totaling $30 spent) reaches [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negative $20]] [00:04:56].

## Understanding Movement on the Number Line
In these examples, spending money or getting colder means moving to the left on a [[visualizing_negative_numbers_on_a_number_line | number line]], indicating that the numbers are getting smaller [00:05:20]. They can become smaller than 0, extending into [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negative numbers]] like [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negative 1]], [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negative 2]], and even decimals like [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negative 1.5]] [00:05:26]. Conversely, adding or gaining something means moving to the right on the [[visualizing_negative_numbers_on_a_number_line | number line]] [00:05:34].

For instance, solving [[arithmetic_examples_with_negative_numbers | problems]] like 3 minus 4 can be understood by starting at 3 on the [[visualizing_negative_numbers_on_a_number_line | number line]] and moving 4 units to the left, which results in [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negative 1]] [00:05:56]. Similarly, 2 minus 8 involves starting at 2 and moving 8 units to the left, landing at [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negative 6]] [00:06:20]. Even starting at a [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negative number]], such as [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negative 4]] minus 2, means starting at [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negative 4]] and moving 2 units further left to reach [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negative 6]] [00:07:43].

When [[adding_and_subtracting_negative_numbers | adding to a negative number]], such as [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negative 3]] plus 2, one starts at [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negative 3]] and moves 2 units to the right on the [[visualizing_negative_numbers_on_a_number_line | number line]], arriving at [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negative 1]] [00:08:30].

These examples demonstrate the practical meaning and application of [[introduction_to_negative_numbers | negative numbers]] and how to [[adding_and_subtracting_negative_numbers | add and subtract them]] in various real-world contexts [00:09:21]. Further exploration will delve into concepts such as [[subtracting_negative_numbers | subtracting a negative number]] [00:09:32].

[[elon_musks_ventures_into_electric_vehicles_space_exploration_and_internet_companies | Elon Musk]] discussed the inspiration behind the Hyperloop concept, stemming from dissatisfaction with existing infrastructure projects and a desire to revolutionize transportation.

## The Problem with California's High-Speed Rail
[[elon_musks_ventures_into_electric_vehicles_space_exploration_and_internet_companies | Elon Musk]] found California's proposed high-speed rail project "quite depressing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:45">[00:43:45]</a> due to its estimated cost of around $100 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:14">[00:44:14]</a>, which would make it the most expensive per mile in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:58">[00:43:58]</a>, and its slow speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>. The projected travel time from Los Angeles to San Francisco would be two hours by train <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:22">[00:44:22]</a>, while a flight currently takes 45 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:24">[00:44:24]</a>. This led [[elon_musks_ventures_into_electric_vehicles_space_exploration_and_internet_companies | Musk]] to question if there was "some better way to do it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:28">[00:44:28]</a>.

## Ideal Transportation System Characteristics
[[elon_musks_ventures_into_electric_vehicles_space_exploration_and_internet_companies | Musk]] outlined key desirable features for a future transportation system:
*   **Speed** It should be at least twice as fast as existing modes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:46">[00:44:46]</a>.
*   **Cost-Efficiency** Tickets should cost half as much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:49">[00:44:49]</a>.
*   **Safety** The system should be immune to crashes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>.
*   **Reliability** It must be immune to weather conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:53">[00:44:53]</a>.
*   **Sustainability** It should be self-powering, potentially through solar panels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>.

[[elon_musks_ventures_into_electric_vehicles_space_exploration_and_internet_companies | Musk]] concluded that a system meeting these criteria "could work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:27">[00:45:27]</a> and "would be practical" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:32">[00:45:32]</a>.

## The Hyperloop Concept
While not explicitly named "Hyperloop" in this segment by [[elon_musks_ventures_into_electric_vehicles_space_exploration_and_internet_companies | Musk]], the description aligns with the concept:
*   It involves a system using "evacuated tubes" or "vacuum tubes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:36">[00:45:36]</a>.
*   [[elon_musks_ventures_into_electric_vehicles_space_exploration_and_internet_companies | Musk]] stated he would reveal more details after [[teslas_mission_and_impact_on_the_automotive_industry | Tesla]] became profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:45">[00:45:45]</a>, likely following their earnings call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>.
*   Despite being busy with [[elon_musks_ventures_into_electric_vehicles_space_exploration_and_internet_companies | other ventures]], [[elon_musks_ventures_into_electric_vehicles_space_exploration_and_internet_companies | Musk]] indicated the idea is "percolating away," with new elements making it better emerging over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>.

### A "Cool" Technology
[[elon_musks_ventures_into_electric_vehicles_space_exploration_and_internet_companies | Musk]] emphasizes that new technology should be "cool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:32">[00:46:32]</a> and something people "look forward to the day that that thing became available" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:15">[00:47:15]</a>. He suggested that even if initial economic assumptions were not met, a Hyperloop-like system from Los Angeles to San Francisco or New York to DC would be so "cool enough that it would be like a tourist attraction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:50">[00:46:50]</a> or "a ride" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:53">[00:46:53]</a>. He also expressed disappointment in the absence of supersonic transport since the Concorde's retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:25">[00:47:25]</a>, noting that modern aircraft like the 787 are only "slightly better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a> than predecessors, which he finds "not that exciting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:44">[00:47:44]</a>.

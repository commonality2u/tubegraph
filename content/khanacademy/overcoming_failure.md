Learning is an inherent human ability, and everyone begins with no innate knowledge or skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. At birth, individuals cannot talk, walk, or perform complex tasks like algebra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. No one is proficient at anything from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Learning from Zero

Even historical figures renowned for their intellect or skill, like [[Inspiration from historical figures | Albert Einstein]] and [[Inspiration from historical figures | William Shakespeare]], had to begin with fundamental [[basic_skills_development | basic skills development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>:
*   Einstein once couldn't count to ten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## The Process of Growth

The path to learning and mastery involves a process of trial and error, often marked by frustration and confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. It entails:
*   Stumbling, slipping, crawling, and falling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   Encountering wrong answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

This journey is characterized by persistent effort, putting one foot in front of the other and building one idea upon the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

### Failing as Growth

A core aspect of [[growth_mindset | growth mindset]] is the understanding that failure is not a stopping point, but a step in the learning process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   Each wrong answer contributes to strengthening the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   "Failing is just another word for growing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

Ultimately, the most complex concepts in the universe are built upon basic ideas that anyone can understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The fundamental belief is that anyone, anywhere, can learn anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

[[overview_of_glycolysis | Glycolysis]] is a fundamental biochemical pathway found in nearly all forms of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Its primary purpose is to break down glucose, a six-carbon molecule, into two molecules of pyruvate, which are three-carbon molecules each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

This [[glycolysis_process_and_its_role_in_breaking_down_glucose | process]] also results in the net production of two ATP molecules and the reduction of two NAD+ molecules to two NADH molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Glycolysis is typically the initial stage of [[stages_of_cellular_respiration | cellular respiration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Phases of Glycolysis

Glycolysis is divided into an "investment phase" and a "payoff phase" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### Investment Phase
In this initial phase, ATP is consumed to prepare glucose for breakdown. A total of two ATP molecules are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

1.  **Phosphorylation of Glucose** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>
    *   Glucose, a six-carbon molecule, is phosphorylated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
    *   The [[enzymes_involved_in_glycolysis | enzyme]] [[enzymes_involved_in_glycolysis | hexokinase]] facilitates this reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Kinases are enzymes that facilitate phosphorylation or dephosphorylation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
    *   [[enzymes_involved_in_glycolysis | Hexokinase]] uses a magnesium ion as a co-factor to help lower the activation energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
    *   This step consumes one ATP molecule (-1 ATP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. The reaction strongly favors the formation of the product, glucose 6-phosphate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
2.  **Isomerization** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>
    *   Glucose 6-phosphate is converted into its isomer, fructose 6-phosphate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
    *   This is an [[enzymes_involved_in_glycolysis | enzyme]]-catalyzed reaction facilitated by [[enzymes_involved_in_glycolysis | phosphoglucose isomerase]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Isomerases help convert one isomer of a molecule to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
    *   This reaction is in equilibrium but is pulled forward as subsequent products are constantly consumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
3.  **Second Phosphorylation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>
    *   Fructose 6-phosphate receives another phosphate group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
    *   This reaction is facilitated by [[enzymes_involved_in_glycolysis | phosphofructokinase]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
    *   It uses another ATP molecule (-1 ATP), bringing the total ATP investment to two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
    *   A magnesium co-factor also assists this reaction by stabilizing negative charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
4.  **Cleavage of Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>
    *   The six-carbon fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is broken into two three-carbon chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
    *   This is facilitated by the [[enzymes_involved_in_glycolysis | enzyme]] [[enzymes_involved_in_glycolysis | fructose bisphosphate aldolase]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Aldolase enzymes facilitate aldol reactions, which can involve breaking or merging molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
    *   The two resulting three-carbon molecules are glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
    *   DHAP can be converted into G3P by the [[enzymes_involved_in_glycolysis | enzyme]] [[enzymes_involved_in_glycolysis | triose phosphate isomerase]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Therefore, from this point, glycolysis can be thought of as processing two molecules of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate per initial glucose molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

### Payoff Phase
In this phase, energy is extracted, leading to the net production of ATP and NADH.

1.  **Oxidation and Phosphorylation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>
    *   Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is oxidized, and a phosphate group is added to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
    *   This is facilitated by a [[enzymes_involved_in_glycolysis | dehydrogenase]] enzyme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
    *   During this step, NAD+ is reduced to NADH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. This NADH can be used later in the electron transport chain to produce more ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. Since this step happens twice (for each G3P molecule), two NADH molecules are produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.
2.  **First ATP Production (Substrate-Level Phosphorylation)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>
    *   A phosphate group is removed from 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (the product of the previous step) and transferred to ADP to form ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
    *   This reaction is facilitated by the [[enzymes_involved_in_glycolysis | enzyme]] [[enzymes_involved_in_glycolysis | phosphoglycerate kinase]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
    *   Since two molecules are being processed, two ATP molecules are produced in this step (+2 ATP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
3.  **Phosphate Group Relocation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>
    *   The phosphate group on 3-phosphoglycerate is moved from the third carbon to the second carbon, forming 2-phosphoglycerate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
    *   This is catalyzed by the [[enzymes_involved_in_glycolysis | enzyme]] [[enzymes_involved_in_glycolysis | phosphoglycerate mutase]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. Mutases are a class of isomerases that move a functional group from one part of a molecule to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
4.  **Dehydration** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>
    *   Water is removed from 2-phosphoglycerate to form phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
    *   This reaction is facilitated by the [[enzymes_involved_in_glycolysis | enzyme]] [[enzymes_involved_in_glycolysis | enolase]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
5.  **Second ATP Production and Pyruvate Formation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>
    *   The final step involves the removal of the phosphate group from phosphoenolpyruvate and its transfer to ADP, producing another ATP molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
    *   This is catalyzed by the [[enzymes_involved_in_glycolysis | enzyme]] [[enzymes_involved_in_glycolysis | pyruvate kinase]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. The kinase here dephosphorylates the molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.
    *   The final product is pyruvate (or pyruvic acid, depending on protonation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.
    *   Since this occurs for both three-carbon molecules, two ATP molecules are produced in this step (+2 ATP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

### Summary of Products

Overall, for each molecule of glucose, [[glycolysis_process_and_phases | glycolysis]] yields:
*   **Net 2 ATP** (2 invested, 4 produced) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>
*   **2 NADH** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>
*   **2 Pyruvate** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>

After glycolysis, the fate of pyruvate and NADH depends on the presence of oxygen. If oxygen is available, these products can enter the mitochondria for the [[enzymecatalyzed_reactions_in_the_krebs_cycle | citric acid cycle]] (Krebs cycle) and oxidative phosphorylation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Without oxygen, anaerobic respiration or fermentation occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

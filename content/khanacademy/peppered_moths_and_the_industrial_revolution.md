Evolution, or more precisely, natural selection, is a process where environmental factors choose certain variations within a population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. This concept can be illustrated through the example of the peppered moth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.

## Natural Variation in Moths

Before the Industrial Revolution in England, there was natural variation within the peppered moth population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>. Some moths were more "peppered" (lighter with spots), while others had fewer spots or were darker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. For thousands of years, this color variation was not a significant trait for their survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.

## Impact of the Industrial Revolution

The Industrial Revolution led to significant environmental changes, particularly the release of soot from coal-powered factories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>. This soot covered surfaces that were once light, like tree trunks, making them pitch black or much darker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.

This environmental shift directly impacted the peppered moths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>. Birds, which preyed on these moths, could now more easily spot the lighter-colored moths against the darkened tree trunks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>. The darker moths, however, became much harder for birds to see <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>.

## Natural Selection in Action

The birds acted as a selective pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>. They caught the lighter moths more frequently before they could reproduce or while they were reproducing, limiting their offspring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>. Conversely, the darker moths were able to reproduce more often because they were less frequently eaten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>.

As a result, the trait for darker coloration became dominant in the peppered moth population, effectively turning them into what could be viewed as "black moths" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>. This change was not a conscious decision or a "genius" act by the moths to become black <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>. Instead, it was a result of the environment "selecting" for existing variations within the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>. The lighter moths had less success in reproducing, while the darker ones reproduced more, leading to the prevalence of the darker trait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>. This demonstrates natural selection happening in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>.

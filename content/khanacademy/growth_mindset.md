A core tenet of a growth mindset is the belief that [[universality_of_learning_capability | anyone can learn anything]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. This perspective highlights that [[universality_of_learning_capability | nobody is born smart]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>; instead, everyone begins [[universality_of_learning_capability | at zero]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

Initially, individuals cannot talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, walk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, or perform complex tasks like algebra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, adding, reading, or riding a bike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. [[universality_of_learning_capability | Nobody is proficient at anything at first]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Even figures like Einstein once struggled to count to ten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, and Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like everyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## The Journey of Learning and the Role of Failure

Thankfully, humans are [[universality_of_learning_capability | born to learn]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. [[the_journey_of_learning | The learning process]] is incremental and often involves:
*   Stumbling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>
*   Slipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>
*   Crawling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>
*   Falling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>
*   [[the_importance_of_failure_in_learning | Failing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>

This process can be frustrating and confusing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, but persistence leads to progress, such as learning to walk one foot in front of the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

Each [[the_importance_of_failure_in_learning | wrong answer]] strengthens the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, illustrating that [[the_importance_of_failure_in_learning | failing is simply another word for growing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This ongoing progression defines [[the_journey_of_learning | learning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>â€”the certainty that understanding will come, even if it hasn't yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.

## Building Knowledge: From Simple to Complex

[[the_learning_process_from_simple_to_complex | The most beautiful and complex concepts in the universe]] are constructed upon [[the_learning_process_from_simple_to_complex | basic ideas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. These fundamental concepts are [[universality_of_learning_capability | accessible to anyone, anywhere]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>, reinforcing the message that the only essential thing to know is that [[universality_of_learning_capability | you can learn anything]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

A central tenet of the growth mindset is the belief that intelligence and abilities are not fixed, but can be developed through dedication and hard work. This perspective emphasizes that everyone starts from a point of zero knowledge and skills, and that the learning process inherently involves challenges and setbacks.

## Starting at Zero

The concept posits that "nobody's born smart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>; instead, "we all start at zero" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. At birth, individuals cannot talk, walk, or perform complex tasks like algebra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Similarly, proficiency in activities like adding, reading, writing, or riding a bike is not innate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, as "nobody's good at anything at first" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Even historical figures like Albert Einstein had to learn to count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, and William Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Learning as a Process of [[Overcoming failure | Overcoming Failure]]

Humans are naturally inclined to [[lifelong_learning | learn]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The journey of acquiring new skills is characterized by a progression of "stumble[s], slip[s], crawl[s], fall[s] and fail[s] and fall[s]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This process of trial and error is crucial, as "each wrong answer mak[es] your brain a little bit stronger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. From this perspective, "failing is just another word for growing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

The essence of this learning approach is "knowing that you'll get it even if you haven't gotten it yet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. It acknowledges that the most intricate and beautiful concepts in the universe are fundamentally built upon [[basic_skills_development | basic ideas]] that anyone can grasp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

Ultimately, regardless of an individual's background or location, the most important understanding is that "you can learn anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

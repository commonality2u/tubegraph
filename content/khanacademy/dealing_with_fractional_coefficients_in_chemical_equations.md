When [[balancing_chemical_equations | balancing chemical equations]], a common issue that arises is the appearance of fractional coefficients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. While these fractions might mathematically balance the number of atoms on both sides of the equation, they are not acceptable in final chemical equations because you cannot have fractions of atoms or molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

## Why Fractional Coefficients Occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>
Fractional coefficients can appear when attempting to match the number of atoms of a particular element on both the reactant and product sides. For instance, if you have two oxygen atoms on one side and three on the other, you might initially multiply the diatomic oxygen molecule by 1.5 to achieve three oxygen atoms on that side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

## The Problem with Fractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>
You "can't have half an atom, or one and a half of an atom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Chemical equations represent the ratios of whole molecules reacting and being produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

## How to Eliminate Fractional Coefficients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>
The solution to fractional coefficients is to multiply *all* coefficients in the entire equation by a number that will convert all fractions into whole numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

### Steps
1.  **Balance the equation as usual**, even if it results in fractional coefficients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
2.  **Identify the fraction(s)**.
3.  **Determine the smallest common multiple** (or simply the denominator of the fraction) that will eliminate the fraction when multiplied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
4.  **Multiply every coefficient** in the balanced equation by this chosen number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. This ensures the relative ratios of reactants and products remain constant, just scaled up to whole numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### Examples of Balancing with Fractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>
#### Example 1: Aluminum and Oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>
Initial unbalanced equation (showing atom count discrepancy):
Al (1 atom) + O₂ (2 atoms) → Al₂O₃ (2 Al atoms, 3 O atoms) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>

1.  **Balance Aluminum:** Start with 2 Al on the left to match the 2 Al on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
    2 Al + O₂ → Al₂O₃ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>
2.  **Balance Oxygen:** Now, there are 2 oxygens on the left and 3 on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. To make them equal, multiply O₂ by 1.5 (or 3/2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
    2 Al + 1.5 O₂ → Al₂O₃ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>
3.  **Eliminate the fraction:** Multiply all coefficients by 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
    (2 * 2) Al + (1.5 * 2) O₂ → (1 * 2) Al₂O₃
    **4 Al + 3 O₂ → 2 Al₂O₃** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>

#### Example 2: Ethane Combustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>
Initial unbalanced equation:
C₂H₆ + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>

1.  **Balance Carbon:** There are 2 carbons on the left, so put a 2 in front of CO₂ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
    C₂H₆ + O₂ → 2 CO₂ + H₂O <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>
2.  **Balance Hydrogen:** There are 6 hydrogens on the left, so put a 3 in front of H₂O (3 * 2 = 6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
    C₂H₆ + O₂ → 2 CO₂ + 3 H₂O <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>
3.  **Balance Oxygen:** Count oxygens on the right: (2 CO₂ * 2 O/CO₂) + (3 H₂O * 1 O/H₂O) = 4 + 3 = 7 oxygens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
    There are 2 oxygens on the left (O₂). To get 7 oxygens on the left, multiply O₂ by 3.5 (or 7/2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
    C₂H₆ + 3.5 O₂ → 2 CO₂ + 3 H₂O <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>
4.  **Eliminate the fraction:** Multiply all coefficients by 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
    (1 * 2) C₂H₆ + (3.5 * 2) O₂ → (2 * 2) CO₂ + (3 * 2) H₂O
    **2 C₂H₆ + 7 O₂ → 4 CO₂ + 6 H₂O** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>

By following these steps, any [[balancing_chemical_equations | chemical equation]] that initially results in fractional coefficients can be correctly represented with whole numbers, which is the standard practice in [[understanding_chemical_equations_and_reactions | chemistry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

This article provides a high-level overview comparing [[process_and_phases_of_mitosis | mitosis]] and [[process_and_phases_of_meiosis | meiosis]], highlighting their starting conditions, outcomes, and roles in biological processes.

## Mitosis

[[process_and_phases_of_mitosis | Mitosis]] is a process of cell division that starts with a cell having a diploid (2n) number of chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. For human beings, this means starting with 46 chromosomes, where 23 chromosomes are inherited from the mother and 23 from the father, or 23 homologous pairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>.

After [[process_and_phases_of_mitosis | mitosis]] and cytokinesis, the process results in two cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>. Each of these resulting cells possesses the same genetic information as the original parent cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>, and they each retain the diploid (2n) number of chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>.

[[process_and_phases_of_mitosis | Mitosis]] is a cyclical process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. The daughter cells produced can undergo interphase, replicate their DNA and centrosomes, grow, and then proceed through [[process_and_phases_of_mitosis | mitosis]] again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. This mechanism is how most of the cells in the body grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>, facilitating development from a single-celled organism into a complex one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. Mitosis occurs in somatic cells, which constitute the bulk of the body's tissues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.

## Meiosis

[[process_and_phases_of_meiosis | Meiosis]] also begins with a cell that has a diploid number of chromosomes (2n) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. During its interphase, this cell also replicates its DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. However, [[process_and_phases_of_meiosis | meiosis]] occurs in two distinct phases: [[phases_of_meiosis | Meiosis One]] and [[phases_of_meiosis | Meiosis Two]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.

### Meiosis One
In [[phases_of_meiosis | Meiosis One]], the process yields two cells, each containing a haploid (n) number of chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. For humans, this means starting with 46 chromosomes and ending with 23 chromosomes in each nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. This phase involves the splitting of homologous pairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. As a result of this splitting, the genetic information in the two cells is not necessarily identical, as chromosomes originally from the father and mother split randomly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.

### Meiosis Two
After [[phases_of_meiosis | Meiosis One]], each of the two haploid cells undergoes [[phases_of_meiosis | Meiosis Two]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. This phase is very similar to [[process_and_phases_of_mitosis | mitosis]], but it begins with cells that already have a haploid number of chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. The ultimate outcome of [[process_and_phases_of_meiosis | meiosis]] is four cells, each containing a haploid number of chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.

### Role in Reproduction
Unlike [[process_and_phases_of_mitosis | mitosis]], [[process_and_phases_of_meiosis | meiosis]] is not a cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. The resulting cells are gametes, or sex cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>. These include sperm cells in males (produced in the testes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a> and egg cells in females (produced in the ovaries) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. In plants, these could be pollen or ovules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.

These gametes are essential for [[role_of_meiosis_in_sexual_reproduction | sexual reproduction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>. They fuse together in fertilization to form a fertilized egg, which can then undergo [[process_and_phases_of_mitosis | mitosis]] to develop into a new organism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.

[[process_and_phases_of_meiosis | Meiosis]] specifically occurs in germ cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>. Germ cells have the unique ability to undergo either [[process_and_phases_of_mitosis | mitosis]] to produce more diploid germ cells or [[process_and_phases_of_meiosis | meiosis]] to produce haploid sperm or egg cells (gametes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.

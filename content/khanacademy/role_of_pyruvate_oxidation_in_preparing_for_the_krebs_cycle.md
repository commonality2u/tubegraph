From: [[khanacademy]] <br/> 

Pyruvate oxidation serves as a crucial preparatory step for the [[enzymecatalyzed_reactions_in_the_krebs_cycle | Krebs cycle]] (also known as the citric acid cycle), ensuring that the products of [[glycolysis_process_and_its_role_in_breaking_down_glucose | glycolysis]] are in the correct form to enter the subsequent stages of cellular respiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

## Location within the Cell

Unlike [[glycolysis_process_and_its_role_in_breaking_down_glucose | glycolysis]], which occurs in the [[overview_of_glycolysis | cytoplasm]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, pyruvate oxidation takes place within the mitochondria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Specifically, the [[enzymecatalyzed_reactions_in_the_krebs_cycle | Krebs cycle]] and its preparatory steps occur in the inner space of the mitochondria, known as the matrix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

## The Oxidation Process

After [[glycolysis_process_and_its_role_in_breaking_down_glucose | glycolysis]] splits a 6-carbon [[role_of_glucose_in_energy_production | glucose]] molecule into two 3-carbon [[formation_and_significance_of_pyruvate | pyruvate]] molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, each [[formation_and_significance_of_pyruvate | pyruvate]] undergoes oxidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. This process involves:
*   **Cleavage of a Carbon:** One carbon atom is cleaved off from the 3-carbon [[formation_and_significance_of_pyruvate | pyruvate]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. This carbon is released as carbon dioxide (CO2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, contributing to the CO2 that is eventually exhaled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Formation of Acetyl-CoA:** The remaining 2-carbon compound is known as [[formation_and_significance_of_pyruvate | acetyl-CoA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. This molecule is the direct input for the [[enzymecatalyzed_reactions_in_the_krebs_cycle | Krebs cycle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Reduction of [[role_of_nad_in_glycolysis | NAD]]:** During this oxidation, [[role_of_nad_in_glycolysis | NAD]]+ is reduced to [[role_of_nad_in_glycolysis | NADH]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>.

Since each [[role_of_glucose_in_energy_production | glucose]] molecule yields two [[formation_and_significance_of_pyruvate | pyruvate]] molecules from [[glycolysis_process_and_its_role_in_breaking_down_glucose | glycolysis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>, the pyruvate oxidation step occurs twice for every initial [[role_of_glucose_in_energy_production | glucose]] molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

## Outputs and Role in Energy Production

For every molecule of [[role_of_glucose_in_energy_production | glucose]], pyruvate oxidation collectively produces:
*   Two molecules of [[formation_and_significance_of_pyruvate | acetyl-CoA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>
*   Two molecules of carbon dioxide (CO2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>
*   Two molecules of [[role_of_nad_in_glycolysis | NADH]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>

While the [[enzymecatalyzed_reactions_in_the_krebs_cycle | Krebs cycle]] is often credited for this step in introductory textbooks, it is more accurately considered a preparatory stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. The [[formation_and_significance_of_pyruvate | acetyl-CoA]] is then ready to combine with oxaloacetic acid to begin the [[enzymecatalyzed_reactions_in_the_krebs_cycle | Krebs cycle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. The [[role_of_nad_in_glycolysis | NADH]] molecules generated here, along with those from [[glycolysis_process_and_its_role_in_breaking_down_glucose | glycolysis]] and the [[enzymecatalyzed_reactions_in_the_krebs_cycle | Krebs cycle]], serve as crucial inputs for the electron transport chain, where the bulk of ATP is produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

### Total NADH Contribution
For every [[role_of_glucose_in_energy_production | glucose]] molecule, the total [[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | NADH]] yield before the electron transport chain is 10:
*   2 [[role_of_nad_in_glycolysis | NADH]] from [[glycolysis_process_and_its_role_in_breaking_down_glucose | glycolysis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>
*   2 [[role_of_nad_in_glycolysis | NADH]] from pyruvate oxidation (one per [[formation_and_significance_of_pyruvate | pyruvate]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>
*   6 [[role_of_nad_in_glycolysis | NADH]] from the [[enzymecatalyzed_reactions_in_the_krebs_cycle | Krebs cycle]] (three per cycle, run twice) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>
This totals 10 [[role_of_nad_in_glycolysis | NADH]] molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. Each [[role_of_nad_in_glycolysis | NADH]] molecule is expected to produce approximately 3 [[atp_production_in_glycolysis | ATP]]s in the electron transport chain, accounting for 30 [[atp_production_in_glycolysis | ATP]]s from [[role_of_nad_in_glycolysis | NADH]] alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

Pyruvate oxidation is a critical juncture, converting the end-product of [[glycolysis_process_and_its_role_in_breaking_down_glucose | glycolysis]] into the form required to fuel the central hub of aerobic respiration, the [[enzymecatalyzed_reactions_in_the_krebs_cycle | Krebs cycle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. This ensures that energy can be extracted efficiently from not only carbohydrates but also other fuel sources like proteins and fats, which can also be converted into [[formation_and_significance_of_pyruvate | acetyl-CoA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

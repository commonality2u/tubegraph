From: [[khanacademy]] <br/> 

The "left to right rule" in operations is a crucial component of the [[order_of_operations]] that ensures a single, consistent interpretation of mathematical statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This rule applies when multiple operations of the same priority level appear in an expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Without such a rule, different interpretations could lead to varied and incorrect answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## When the Rule Applies

The agreed-upon [[order_of_operations]] dictates that operations are performed in a specific sequence:
1.  Parentheses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>
2.  Exponents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>
3.  Multiplication and Division (same level of priority) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>
4.  Addition and Subtraction (same level of priority) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>

When multiple operations exist at the *same level* of priority (e.g., both multiplication and division, or both addition and subtraction), the "left to right rule" states that you should perform these operations as they appear from left to right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

### Addition and Subtraction
For expressions containing only addition and subtraction, operations are performed from left to right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

```
Example: 1 + 2 - 3 + 4 - 1
```
1.  `1 + 2 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>
2.  `3 - 3 = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>
3.  `0 + 4 = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>
4.  `4 - 1 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>

### Multiplication and Division
Similarly, for expressions containing only multiplication and division, operations are performed from left to right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

```
Example: 4 × 2 ÷ 3 × 2
```
1.  `4 × 2 = 8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>
2.  `8 ÷ 3 = 8/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>
3.  `8/3 × 2 = 16/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>

## Special Cases: When Order Doesn't Matter

The "left to right rule" is essential when different types of operations (like addition and subtraction, or multiplication and division) are mixed. However, if an expression contains *only* addition or *only* multiplication, the order in which you perform the operations does not affect the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

```
Example (All Addition): 1 + 5 + 7 + 3 + 2
```
In this case, you can add from left to right, right to left, or any other order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

```
Example (All Multiplication): 1 × 5 × 7 × 3 × 2
```
For multiplication, the order also does not matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

However, if there is any division or subtraction mixed in, it is best to stick to the left-to-right rule within that priority level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

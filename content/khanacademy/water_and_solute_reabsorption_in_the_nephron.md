The [[Kidney overview and function | kidneys]] are vital organs primarily known for waste excretion, but they also play a crucial role in maintaining proper water balance, electrolyte levels, and blood pressure in the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This is largely achieved through the intricate processes of filtration and reabsorption carried out by the [[nephron_structure_and_function | nephron]], the [[nephron_structure_and_function | kidney]]'s smallest functional unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The overall function of the [[kidney_overview_and_function | kidney]] to excrete waste and maintain water levels occurs at the [[nephron_structure_and_function | nephron]] level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Initial Filtration in the Bowman's Capsule

The process begins when blood enters the [[nephron_structure_and_function | nephron]] via the afferent arteriole and flows into a tangled capillary network called the glomerulus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This glomerulus is highly porous and is surrounded by the Bowman's capsule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Due to high blood pressure, about one-fifth of the fluid from the blood is squeezed out and enters the Bowman's space, forming what is known as filtrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

The filtrate primarily consists of fluid, small ions like sodium, and small molecules such as glucose and amino acids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Larger components like red blood cells or large proteins are typically not filtered out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. At this stage, the fluid cannot be called urine yet, as it still contains many useful substances the body needs to retain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

## Reabsorption in the Proximal Tubule

After filtration in the Bowman's capsule, the filtrate enters the proximal tubule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. This convoluted segment of the [[nephron_structure_and_function | nephron]] is where the crucial process of reabsorbing beneficial substances back into the bloodstream begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. The body actively reabsorbs valuable components like glucose, sodium, and amino acids, which are essential for energy and building proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

This reabsorption is an active process, requiring [[atp_synthase_function_and_mechanism | ATP]] (adenosine triphosphate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. For instance, [[atp_synthase_function_and_mechanism | ATP]] is used to pump out sodium, which in turn aids in the reabsorption of other substances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. A significant amount of water is also reabsorbed here to prevent excessive water loss, as otherwise, gallons of water would be excreted daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

## The Loop of Henle: Concentrating Urine

The loop of Henle is a distinctive U-shaped segment of the [[nephron_structure_and_function | nephron]] that extends from the [[role_of_the_renal_cortex_and_medulla | renal cortex]] deep into the [[role_of_the_renal_cortex_and_medulla | renal medulla]] and then loops back up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. Its unique structure and placement are critical for the efficient reabsorption of water.

### Making the Medulla Salty

A primary function of the loop of Henle is to establish a high salt concentration gradient in the surrounding [[role_of_the_renal_cortex_and_medulla | renal medulla]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. The ascending limb of the loop of Henle actively pumps out salts, including sodium, potassium, and chloride ions, into the [[role_of_the_renal_cortex_and_medulla | interstitial fluid]] of the [[role_of_the_renal_cortex_and_medulla | medulla]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. This process requires [[atp_synthase_function_and_mechanism | ATP]] to move these ions against their [[diffusion_basics | concentration gradient]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. Importantly, the ascending limb is impermeable to water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. By pumping out solutes, the [[role_of_the_renal_cortex_and_medulla | medulla]] becomes progressively saltier and thus [[hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | hypertonic]] relative to the filtrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

### Water Reabsorption via Osmosis

In contrast, the descending limb of the loop of Henle is highly permeable to water but not to salts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. As the filtrate moves down the descending limb into the increasingly salty [[role_of_the_renal_cortex_and_medulla | medulla]], water naturally moves out of the tubule and into the [[role_of_the_renal_cortex_and_medulla | interstitial fluid]] by [[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | osmosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. This is a passive process, driven by the [[hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | hypertonic]] environment created by the ascending limb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. The loop of Henle's length allows sufficient time for this substantial water reabsorption to occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

## Distal Convoluted Tubule and Collecting Ducts

After the loop of Henle, the filtrate enters the distal convoluted tubule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. Here, further selective reabsorption takes place, including additional sodium, calcium, and some water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.

Finally, the processed filtrate, now much more concentrated and containing primarily waste products and excess water, empties into collecting ducts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>. Multiple [[nephron_structure_and_function | nephrons]] drain into these ducts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. The collecting ducts also pass through the salty [[role_of_the_renal_cortex_and_medulla | renal medulla]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>. The permeability of the collecting duct to water is regulated by hormones, such as anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. When permeable, more water can leave the filtrate and be reabsorbed into the body, further concentrating the urine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>. This final fine-tuning ensures that the body retains the optimal amount of water before the urine is sent to the urinary bladder for excretion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.

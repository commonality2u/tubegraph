This article explores various [[methods_for_solving_quadratic_equations | methods for solving quadratic equations]], with a primary focus on the technique known as completing the square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This versatile method is applicable to any [[solving_quadratic_equations | quadratic equation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a> and serves as the foundation for the [[introduction_to_the_quadratic_formula | quadratic formula]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The [[introduction_to_the_quadratic_formula | quadratic formula]] itself can be proven using completing the square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Completing the Square

Completing the square is a technique centered on transforming a [[solving_quadratic_equations | quadratic equation]] into a perfect square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This involves strategically adding and subtracting values from both sides of the equation to achieve the desired perfect square form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

### Steps and Example 1

Consider the [[solving_quadratic_equations | quadratic equation]] $x^2 - 4x = 5$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
The goal is to make the left-hand side a perfect square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. For an expression like $x^2 - 2ax + a^2 = (x - a)^2$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>:
1.  **Identify the coefficient of the x-term:** In $x^2 - 4x$, the coefficient is -4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
2.  **Take half of the x-coefficient:** Half of -4 is -2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. This value represents 'a' in the perfect square binomial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
3.  **Square the result:** $(-2)^2 = 4$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. This is the number needed to complete the square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
4.  **Add this number to both sides of the equation:**
    $x^2 - 4x + 4 = 5 + 4$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>
    $x^2 - 4x + 4 = 9$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>
5.  **Rewrite the left side as a perfect square:**
    $(x - 2)^2 = 9$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>
6.  **Take the square root of both sides:**
    $x - 2 = \pm 3$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>
7.  **Solve for x:**
    $x = 2 \pm 3$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>
    This yields two solutions:
    *   $x = 2 + 3 = 5$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>
    *   $x = 2 - 3 = -1$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>

### Comparison with Factoring

For the example above, [[factoring_quadratic_equations | factoring]] could also be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
Starting with $x^2 - 4x = 5$, subtract 5 from both sides to get $x^2 - 4x - 5 = 0$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
Then, factor the quadratic: $(x - 5)(x + 1) = 0$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
This leads to the solutions $x = 5$ or $x = -1$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

While [[factoring_quadratic_equations | factoring]] might be faster in some cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, completing the square has the advantage of always working, regardless of the coefficients or complexity of the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### Example 2: A More Complex Quadratic

Consider the equation $10x^2 - 30x - 8 = 0$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
1.  **Simplify by dividing by a common factor:** Divide both sides by 2:
    $5x^2 - 15x - 4 = 0$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>
2.  **Make the leading coefficient 1:** Divide the entire equation by 5:
    $x^2 - 3x - \frac{4}{5} = 0$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>
    This form makes [[factoring_quadratic_equations | factoring]] very difficult due to the fraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
3.  **Move the constant term to the right side:** Add $\frac{4}{5}$ to both sides:
    $x^2 - 3x = \frac{4}{5}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>
4.  **Complete the square:**
    *   Take half of the x-coefficient (-3): $-\frac{3}{2}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
    *   Square it: $(-\frac{3}{2})^2 = \frac{9}{4}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
5.  **Add this number to both sides:**
    $x^2 - 3x + \frac{9}{4} = \frac{4}{5} + \frac{9}{4}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>
6.  **Find a common denominator for the right side:**
    $\frac{4}{5} = \frac{16}{20}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>
    $\frac{9}{4} = \frac{45}{20}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>
    So, $\frac{16}{20} + \frac{45}{20} = \frac{61}{20}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
7.  **Rewrite the left side as a perfect square:**
    $(x - \frac{3}{2})^2 = \frac{61}{20}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>
8.  **Take the square root of both sides:**
    $x - \frac{3}{2} = \pm \sqrt{\frac{61}{20}}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>
9.  **Solve for x:**
    $x = \frac{3}{2} \pm \sqrt{\frac{61}{20}}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>

This final expression yields values that would be impossible to find through simple [[factoring_quadratic_equations | factoring]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
The approximate values are:
*   $x \approx 3.246$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>
*   $x \approx -0.246$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>

Completing the square is a powerful [[methods_for_solving_quadratic_equations | method]] for [[solving_quadratic_equations | solving quadratic equations]] because of its universal applicability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. It forms the core understanding needed to derive and use the [[introduction_to_the_quadratic_formula | quadratic formula]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>, which allows for direct "plug and play" [[solving_quadratic_equations | solutions]] to any [[solving_quadratic_equations | quadratic equation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.

SOHCAHTOA is a [[mnemonic_device_for_remembering_trigonometric_functions|mnemonic]] commonly used in trigonometry to remember the definitions of the three basic [[trigonometric_ratios_and_soh_cah_toa_mnemonic|trigonometric functions]]: sine, cosine, and tangent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. The term itself is often repeated when solving [[trigonometric_ratios_and_soh_cah_toa_mnemonic|trigonometry]] problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

The name "SOHCAHTOA" is believed to derive from Ancient Greek, meaning "triangle measure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. It is primarily used in the study of right triangles to understand the relationship between their sides and angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.

## Deciphering SOHCAHTOA

The mnemonic breaks down into three parts, each corresponding to a [[trigonometric_ratios_and_soh_cah_toa_mnemonic|trigonometric ratio]]:

*   **SOH** (Sine = Opposite / Hypotenuse) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>
*   **CAH** (Cosine = Adjacent / Hypotenuse) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>
*   **TOA** (Tangent = Opposite / Adjacent) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>

These ratios tell you the relationship between the sides of a right triangle relative to a specific angle (often denoted as theta, θ) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

## Application in a Right Triangle

Consider a right triangle with sides of lengths 3, 4, and a hypotenuse of 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. Let's define an angle within this triangle as theta (θ) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.

### Sine of Theta (SOH)

To find the sine of theta (sin θ), you use the "SOH" part of the mnemonic: Opposite over Hypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

*   The side opposite angle theta is 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.
*   The hypotenuse (the longest side, opposite the right angle) is 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.

Therefore, sin θ = Opposite / Hypotenuse = 4/5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

### Cosine of Theta (CAH)

To find the cosine of theta (cos θ), you use the "CAH" part of the mnemonic: Adjacent over Hypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.

*   The side adjacent to angle theta is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>.
*   The hypotenuse is 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>.

Therefore, cos θ = Adjacent / Hypotenuse = 3/5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.

### Tangent of Theta (TOA)

To find the tangent of theta (tan θ), you use the "TOA" part of the mnemonic: Opposite over Adjacent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>.

*   The side opposite angle theta is 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>.
*   The side adjacent to angle theta is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>.

Therefore, tan θ = Opposite / Adjacent = 4/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>.

### Importance of Angle Reference

The values of the [[trigonometric_ratios_and_soh_cah_toa_mnemonic|trigonometric functions]] depend on which angle of the right triangle is being referenced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>. For example, if a different angle (let's call it 'x') in the same triangle is chosen:

*   The opposite side for angle x is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>.
*   The adjacent side for angle x is 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>.

Thus, tan x = Opposite / Adjacent = 3/4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>. Notice that tan θ (4/3) is the inverse of tan x (3/4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>.

The SOHCAHTOA mnemonic simplifies the process of identifying the correct sides (opposite, adjacent, hypotenuse) for calculating sine, cosine, and tangent ratios for a given angle in a right triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.

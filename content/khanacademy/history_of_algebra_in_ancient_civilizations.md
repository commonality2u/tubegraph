The word "algebra" and many of its modern ideas originate from a book titled "Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This significant text was written by [[significant_historical_figures_in_algebra | al-Khwarizmi]], a Persian mathematician, around 820 AD in Baghdad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The term "algebra" itself is an Arabic word, "Al-gabr," meaning "restoration or completion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. [[significant_historical_figures_in_algebra | Al-Khwarizmi]] connected this to the operation of moving elements from one side of an [[algebraic_techniques_for_solving_equations | equation]] to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Early Traces of Algebra

While [[significant_historical_figures_in_algebra | al-Khwarizmi]] is credited with coining the term and developing many modern concepts of [[the_abstraction_and_generalization_in_algebra | algebra]], the underlying ideas were explored much earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

### Ancient Babylon
The first known records of algebraic exploration date back to ancient Babylon around 2000 BC (before the common era) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Stone tablets from this period show evidence of people investigating fundamental algebraic concepts, even without using modern symbols or numerical representations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Babylon, located in Mesopotamia, maintained the mathematical traditions of Sumeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

### Diophantus of Alexandria
Between 200 and 300 AD, [[significant_historical_figures_in_algebra | Diophantus]], a Greek mathematician living in Alexandria (then part of the Roman Empire), made significant contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. [[significant_historical_figures_in_algebra | Diophantus]] is sometimes referred to as the "father of algebra," a title also debated with [[significant_historical_figures_in_algebra | al-Khwarizmi]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. While [[significant_historical_figures_in_algebra | Diophantus]] focused more on specific problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>, both he and [[significant_historical_figures_in_algebra | al-Khwarizmi]] introduced unique advancements to what is now known as [[origins_of_algebra | algebra]], building upon but not simply copying Babylonian knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. Many Western historians often associate [[significant_historical_figures_in_algebra | Diophantus]] as the father of [[origins_of_algebra | algebra]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

### Brahmagupta of India
Around 600 AD, another notable mathematician in the [[origins_of_algebra | history of algebra]] was Brahmagupta from India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. He also made significant contributions to the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

## The Modern Foundations
[[significant_historical_figures_in_algebra | Al-Khwarizmi]], appearing around the 8th or 9th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, is definitively credited with the name "algebra" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. He is also considered one of the fathers of [[the_fundamental_role_of_algebra_in_mathematics | algebra]] because he began to conceptualize [[the_abstraction_and_generalization_in_algebra | algebra]] in an abstract sense, moving beyond specific problems to a more general approach, akin to how modern mathematicians approach the discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

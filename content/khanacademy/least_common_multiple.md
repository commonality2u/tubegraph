The [[least_common_multiple_definition_and_explanation | least common multiple]] (LCM) is the smallest number that is a multiple of two or more given numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. It is a fundamental concept in arithmetic, particularly useful when performing operations like adding or subtracting fractions with [[understanding_basic_multiplication | different denominators]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Role in Adding Fractions

When adding fractions that have [[understanding_basic_multiplication | different denominators]], the first step is to find a [[finding_a_common_denominator | common denominator]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This common denominator must be a number that both original denominators can divide into <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The [[least_common_multiple_definition_and_explanation | least common multiple]] serves as the most efficient [[finding_a_common_denominator | common denominator]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## [[brute_force_method_for_finding_least_common_multiple | Methods for Finding the LCM]]

There are various ways to find the [[least_common_multiple_definition_and_explanation | least common multiple]]. One straightforward approach is to list multiples of one of the numbers until a common multiple is found.

### [[brute_force_method_for_finding_least_common_multiple | Listing Multiples Method]]

This method involves checking multiples of one denominator to see if they are divisible by the other denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

#### Example: Finding the LCM of 9 and 12

To find the LCM of 9 and 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>:
1.  Start listing multiples of 9:
    *   9 (not divisible by 12) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>
    *   18 (not divisible by 12) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>
    *   27 (not divisible by 12) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>
    *   36 (is divisible by 12, as 12 × 3 = 36) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>
2.  Since both 9 and 12 divide into 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, 36 is the [[least_common_multiple_definition_and_explanation | least common multiple]] of 9 and 12.

## [[application_of_least_common_multiple_in_problem_solving | Application of LCM in Problem Solving]]

Once the LCM is found, it is used to rewrite the fractions with a [[finding_a_common_denominator | common denominator]], allowing for addition or subtraction.

### Example: Adding 4/9 and 11/12

1.  **Find the LCM**: As determined above, the LCM of 9 and 12 is 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
2.  **Convert 4/9**: To change the denominator from 9 to 36, multiply by 4 (9 × 4 = 36) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. To keep the fraction equivalent, multiply the numerator by the same factor: 4 × 4 = 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. So, 4/9 becomes 16/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
3.  **Convert 11/12**: To change the denominator from 12 to 36, multiply by 3 (12 × 3 = 36) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Multiply the numerator by the same factor: 11 × 3 = 33 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. So, 11/12 becomes 33/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
4.  **Add the new fractions**: Now that they have the same denominator, add the numerators: 16/36 + 33/36 = (16 + 33)/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
5.  **Simplify**: 16 + 33 = 49, so the sum is 49/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. This is an improper fraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
6.  **Convert to a mixed number**: Divide 49 by 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. 36 goes into 49 one time with a remainder of 13 (49 - 36 = 13) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. So, the mixed number is 1 and 13/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

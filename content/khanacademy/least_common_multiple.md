The [[least_common_multiple_of_denominators | Least Common Multiple]] (LCM) is the smallest number that is a multiple of two or more given numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. It is often denoted as LCM(a, b) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Examples

### LCM of 36 and 12

The LCM of 36 and 12 is 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This is because 36 is a multiple of 12 (12 x 3 = 36) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, and 36 is also a multiple of itself (36 x 1 = 36) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

### LCM of 18 and 12

To find the LCM of 18 and 12, there are two primary methods:

### 1. [[prime_factorization | Prime Factorization]] Approach

This method involves finding the [[prime_factorization | prime factorization]] of each number and then constructing the smallest number that contains all the prime factors of both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

*   **Step 1: Find the [[prime_factorization | prime factorization]] of each number.**
    *   For 18: 18 = 2 × 9 = 2 × 3 × 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
    *   For 12: 12 = 2 × 6 = 2 × 2 × 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

*   **Step 2: Construct the LCM using the prime factors.**
    The LCM must contain enough prime factors to be divisible by both numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
    *   To be divisible by 18, it needs at least one '2' and two '3's (2 × 3 × 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
    *   To also be divisible by 12, it needs two '2's and one '3' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Since we already have one '2' and one '3' from the 18's factors, we only need to add one more '2' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
    *   Therefore, the LCM is 2 × 3 × 3 (from 18) × 2 (the missing factor for 12) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

*   **Step 3: Calculate the product.**
    *   LCM(18, 12) = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 = 4 × 3 × 3 = 12 × 3 = 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### 2. Brute Force Method (Listing Multiples)

This method involves listing out the multiples of each number until a common multiple is found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

*   **Step 1: List multiples of each number.**
    *   Multiples of 18: 18, 36, 54, ... <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>
    *   Multiples of 12: 12, 24, 36, ... <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>

*   **Step 2: Identify the smallest common multiple.**
    The smallest number that appears in both lists is 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

## Comparison of Methods

While the brute force method can be quick for smaller numbers, the [[prime_factorization | prime factorization]] method is more systematic and advantageous for finding the LCM of larger or more complex numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. It provides a clear process for decomposing numbers and then building the LCM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

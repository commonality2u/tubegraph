The circle is considered the most fundamental shape in the universe, appearing in the orbits of planets, wheels, and even at the molecular level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Understanding its properties is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Fundamental Properties of a Circle

A circle is defined as all points that are equidistant from a central point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

*   **Radius (r)**: This "equal distance" from the center to any point on the edge of the circle is called the radius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. For example, if a radius is 3 centimeters, all radii of that circle will be 3 centimeters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Diameter (D)**: The widest point of a circle, passing through its center, is called the diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. The diameter is always twice the radius (D = 2r) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   **Circumference (C)**: The distance around the circle is known as its circumference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## The Discovery of Pi (π)

For thousands of years, people measured the circumferences and diameters of various circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Early, less precise measurements often suggested that the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter was approximately 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. This consistent ratio for any circle became a significant observation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

As measurement tools improved, more accurate values emerged, first around 3.1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, and then progressively closer to 3.14159 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Researchers observed that the digits of this ratio never repeated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, indicating it is an [[irrational_numbers_and_their_characteristics | irrational number]].

Recognizing the fundamental and consistent appearance of this "strange fascinating metaphysical number" across all circles, it was given a special name: Pi (π) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. Pi is considered one of the most fascinating numbers in the universe, showing up widely throughout mathematics and suggesting an underlying order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

### Pi as a Number
It is important to remember that pi (π) is simply a number, approximately 3.14159 and continuing indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. Due to its infinite, non-repeating decimal nature, it is often represented by the Greek letter π for simplicity in calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

## Formulas Involving Pi

The fundamental relationship from which pi is derived is:
Circumference / Diameter = π <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>

From this, we can derive the formulas for circumference:
*   **Circumference = π * Diameter** (C = πD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>
*   Since Diameter = 2 * Radius, we can also express circumference as **Circumference = 2 * π * Radius** (C = 2πr) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>

### Practical Examples

**Example 1: Calculating Circumference**
If a circle has a radius of 3 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>:
*   The circumference (C) = 2πr = 2 * π * 3 meters = 6π meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   The diameter (D) = 2r = 2 * 3 meters = 6 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
    *   *Note*: Answers are often left "in terms of pi" (e.g., 6π) for precision, rather than multiplying by the approximate decimal value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

**Example 2: Calculating Diameter and Radius from Circumference**
If a circle has a circumference of 10 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>:
*   Using the formula C = πD, we have 10 meters = πD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   To find the diameter (D), divide both sides by π: D = 10/π meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   To find the radius (r), recall that r = D/2: r = (10/π) / 2 = 5/π meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

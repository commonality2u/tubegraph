Chemistry is a fundamental science that helps humanity understand, model, and predict the nature of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. It provides a framework for comprehending the vast complexity of the universe, from the grand scale of celestial bodies to the intricate processes within living organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### Simplifying Complexity
The world around us, including our planet and the broader universe, presents an overwhelming array of substances and phenomena, such as fire, rock, water, meteorological patterns, and the electrochemical interactions within the human brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. What appears to be an infinite spectrum of differences can be daunting to understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

Over thousands of years, humanity has gradually developed an understanding that this immense complexity stems from a finite number of basic building blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Chemistry reveals that all matter is composed of a finite number of elements, analogous to LEGO bricks, which combine in various ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Common elements like carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen disproportionately appear in many substances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Furthermore, these [[periodic_table_of_elements | elements]] themselves are made of subatomic particles—protons, electrons, and neutrons—arranged differently to give them their distinct properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### [[relation_between_chemistry_and_other_sciences | Chemistry's Place Among Sciences]]
Chemistry is situated within a hierarchy of sciences, each building upon the previous one to explain reality:
*   **Mathematics** forms the purest level, studying logical ideas that can be independent of observed phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   **Physics** builds upon mathematics, exploring the most basic constituents of matter and the mathematical properties governing their interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   **Chemistry** is closely related to physics, utilizing mathematical principles and physical laws to understand how different building blocks interact to explain phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Chemical equations and molecular structures involve quantum mechanical interactions that, while not fully understood at the deepest level, can be used to make predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. For example, chemistry explains combustion, such as hydrogen burning with oxygen to produce energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Biology** is built upon chemistry, as all biological processes, from speaking to thinking, are based on molecular interactions between atoms and molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   Further sciences like psychology and economics then build upon biology, demonstrating a comprehensive framework for explaining the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

Chemistry's ability to create models allows us to understand interactions at scales and speeds that cannot be directly observed, yet enable accurate predictions about the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. The knowledge gained in chemistry represents a significant achievement in [[historical_development_of_chemistry | humanity's quest]] to understand fundamental questions about existence and the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

Cellular respiration is the process by which living organisms derive energy from fuel, primarily glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. This complex process can be broadly divided into stages, some of which do not require oxygen.

## Anaerobic Respiration

The first stage of cellular respiration is [[glycolysis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. This process literally means "breaking up glucose" ("glyco" for glucose and "lysis" meaning to break up) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>. [[glycolysis]] breaks down a 6-carbon glucose molecule into two 3-carbon molecules called pyruvate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>.

A key characteristic of [[glycolysis_process]] is that it does not require oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>. This makes it an *anaerobic process* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>, meaning it can occur whether oxygen is present or absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>.

In terms of energy production, [[glycolysis]] generates a net of two ATP molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>. While it consumes two ATPs, it generates four, resulting in a net gain of two ATPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>.

### Limited Energy Production

When cells are deprived of oxygen, they can still produce a small amount of energy through [[glycolysis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>. However, this is significantly less than the energy produced when oxygen is available for the subsequent stages of cellular respiration, such as the [[krebs_cycle]] and the electron transport chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>.

## Fermentation

When oxygen is not available, the byproducts of [[glycolysis]] (pyruvate) cannot enter the oxygen-dependent [[krebs_cycle]] and electron transport chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>. Instead, they proceed through a different side process called [[fermentation_and_its_products | fermentation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>. This process is crucial because it allows [[glycolysis]] to continue producing ATP by regenerating molecules necessary for its operation.

### Types of Fermentation

Different organisms perform different types of [[fermentation_and_its_products | fermentation]]:

*   **Alcohol Fermentation**
    For some organisms, the byproducts of [[glycolysis]] are converted into alcohol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:00">[10:55:00]</a>. This is how alcohol is produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>. Yeast, for example, performs alcohol fermentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>.
*   **Lactic Acid Fermentation**
    Human muscles, and probably other mammals, do not produce alcohol directly. Instead, they produce lactic acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:00">[11:06:00]</a>. This is known as lactic acid [[fermentation_and_its_products | fermentation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>. The buildup of lactic acid in muscles can cause them to ache during intense activity when oxygen supply is insufficient, such as during a hard sprint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:00">[11:35:00]</a>.

[[fermentation_and_its_products | Fermentation]] serves as a vital pathway when oxygen is scarce, ensuring that [[glycolysis]] can continue to generate a small but immediate supply of ATP for cellular functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>.

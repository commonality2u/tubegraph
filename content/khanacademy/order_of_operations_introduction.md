[[importance_of_a_standardized_order_of_operations | Order of operations]] is a fundamental concept in mathematics, forming the basis for nearly all subsequent mathematical work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Its primary purpose is to ensure a single, consistent way to interpret any [[Mathematical expressions | mathematical statement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## The Problem Without a Standardized Order

Without an agreed-upon [[importance_of_a_standardized_order_of_operations | order of operations]], a single [[Mathematical expressions | mathematical statement]] could lead to different results, which is unacceptable in mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

Consider the [[Mathematical expressions | mathematical statement]]: `7 + 3 * 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

### Interpretation 1: [[difference_between_left_to_right_evaluation_and_proper_operations_order | Left-to-Right Evaluation]]

If one were to simply read the expression from [[difference_between_left_to_right_evaluation_and_proper_operations_order | left to right]], performing [[introduction_to_basic_addition | addition]] before [[arithmetic_operations | multiplication]]:
> 7 plus 3 times 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>
> 7 + 3 = 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>
> 10 * 5 = 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>

### Interpretation 2: Prioritizing [[Arithmetic operations | Multiplication]]

Another approach might prioritize [[arithmetic_operations | multiplication]] before [[introduction_to_basic_addition | addition]]:
> 7 plus (3 times 5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>
> 3 * 5 = 15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>
> 7 + 15 = 22 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>

These two interpretations yield different answers (50 versus 22) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Such ambiguity could lead to significant errors, like a satellite being sent to Mars instead of the moon if computers interpreted calculations differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This highlights the critical need for a standardized [[importance_of_a_standardized_order_of_operations | order of operations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## The Agreed-Upon Order of Operations

The universally agreed-upon [[importance_of_a_standardized_order_of_operations | order of operations]] is as follows:

> [!tip] Order of Operations
> 1.  **Parentheses** first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
> 2.  **Exponents** next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. (Note: Exponents will not be present in examples in this specific video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.)
> 3.  **Multiplication and Division** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. These have the same level of priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
> 4.  **Addition and Subtraction** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. These also have the same level of priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

By following this order, everyone should arrive at the same answer for a given statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

## Applying the Order of Operations

### Example 1: `7 + 3 * 5`

Using the agreed-upon [[importance_of_a_standardized_order_of_operations | order of operations]] for `7 + 3 * 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>:
1.  **Parentheses**: None <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
2.  **Exponents**: None <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
3.  **Multiplication/Division**: Perform the [[arithmetic_operations | multiplication]] `3 * 5` first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
    *   `3 * 5 = 15` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>
4.  **Addition/Subtraction**: Perform the [[introduction_to_basic_addition | addition]].
    *   `7 + 15 = 22` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>

Therefore, the correct interpretation of `7 + 3 * 5` is 22 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

### Example 2: `(7 + 3) * 4 / 2 - 5 * 6`

Let's apply the [[importance_of_a_standardized_order_of_operations | order of operations]] to a more complex expression: `(7 + 3) * 4 / 2 - 5 * 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

1.  **Parentheses**: First, evaluate the expression inside the parentheses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
    *   `(7 + 3) = 10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>
    *   The expression becomes: `10 * 4 / 2 - 5 * 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>

2.  **Exponents**: There are no [[Introduction to Algebra | exponents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

3.  **Multiplication and Division**: Perform [[arithmetic_operations | multiplication]] and [[arithmetic_operations | division]] from [[difference_between_left_to_right_evaluation_and_proper_operations_order | left to right]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
    *   First, `10 * 4 = 40` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
    *   The expression becomes: `40 / 2 - 5 * 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
    *   Next, `40 / 2 = 20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
    *   And simultaneously, perform the other [[arithmetic_operations | multiplication]]: `5 * 6 = 30` <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
    *   The expression becomes: `20 - 30` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

4.  **Addition and Subtraction**: Finally, perform [[arithmetic_operations | addition]] and [[arithmetic_operations | subtraction]] from [[difference_between_left_to_right_evaluation_and_proper_operations_order | left to right]].
    *   `20 - 30 = -10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

The correct interpretation of `(7 + 3) * 4 / 2 - 5 * 6` is -10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

## Operations at the Same Level

When multiple [[arithmetic_operations | operations]] are at the same level of priority (e.g., all [[introduction_to_basic_addition | addition]] and [[arithmetic_operations | subtraction]], or all [[arithmetic_operations | multiplication]] and [[arithmetic_operations | division]]), you should always proceed from [[difference_between_left_to_right_evaluation_and_proper_operations_order | left to right]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

### Example: All [[Arithmetic operations | Addition]] and [[Arithmetic operations | Subtraction]]

`1 + 2 - 3 + 4 - 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>
> 1. `1 + 2 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>
> 2. `3 - 3 = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>
> 3. `0 + 4 = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>
> 4. `4 - 1 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>

### Example: All [[Arithmetic operations | Multiplication]] and [[Arithmetic operations | Division]]

`4 * 2 / 3 * 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>
> 1. `4 * 2 = 8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>
> 2. `8 / 3 = 8/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>
> 3. `8/3 * 2 = 16/3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>

## When Order Doesn't Strictly Matter

The only time you can be flexible with the [[importance_of_a_standardized_order_of_operations | order of operations]] is when an expression contains **only** [[introduction_to_basic_addition | addition]] or **only** [[arithmetic_operations | multiplication]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. In these specific cases, the order of operations does not affect the final result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. However, if there is a mix of [[arithmetic_operations | addition]] and [[arithmetic_operations | subtraction]], or [[arithmetic_operations | multiplication]] and [[arithmetic_operations | division]], it is best to strictly follow the [[difference_between_left_to_right_evaluation_and_proper_operations_order | left-to-right]] rule for operations at the same priority level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

There are many ways to represent a linear equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. For example, the equation `y = 2x + 3` can be rewritten in an infinite number of equivalent forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Equivalent Forms
A single [[introduction_to_linear_equations | linear equation]] can be manipulated using algebraic operations to produce different, but equivalent, representations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

Examples of equivalent forms for `y = 2x + 3` include:
*   `y = 2x + 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>
*   `-2x + y = 3` (obtained by subtracting `2x` from both sides) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   `y - 5 = 2(x - 1)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>

All these forms are equivalent and can be derived from one another through logical algebraic steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Slope-Intercept Form

One particularly useful way to represent a linear equation is the [[slopeintercept_form_of_a_linear_equation | slope-intercept form]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, which is typically written as `y = mx + b` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

In this form:
*   `m` represents the [[slopeintercept_form_of_a_linear_equation | slope]] of the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
*   `b` represents the y-intercept, which is the y-coordinate where the line crosses the y-axis (i.e., when x = 0) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

### Graphing from Slope-Intercept Form

The [[slopeintercept_form_of_a_linear_equation | slope-intercept form]] makes it easy to [[graphing_linear_equations | graph]] a linear equation because it directly reveals the y-intercept and the slope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

#### Example: `y = 2x + 3`

1.  **Identify the y-intercept**:
    *   In `y = 2x + 3`, the y-intercept is `3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
    *   This means the line crosses the y-axis at the point `(0, 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. This is the point where `x = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
    *   Plot the point `(0, 3)` on the coordinate plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

2.  **Identify the slope**:
    *   In `y = 2x + 3`, the slope (`m`) is `2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
    *   Slope is defined as the change in y (`Δy`) over the change in x (`Δx`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. A slope of `2` means for every `1` unit increase in x, y increases by `2` units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
    *   Starting from the y-intercept `(0, 3)`:
        *   If `x` increases by `1` (from `0` to `1`), `y` increases by `2` (from `3` to `5`), leading to the point `(1, 5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
        *   If `x` increases by `1` again (from `1` to `2`), `y` increases by `2` (from `5` to `7`), leading to the point `(2, 7)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
        *   If `x` decreases by `1` (from `0` to `-1`), `y` decreases by `2` (from `3` to `1`), leading to the point `(-1, 1)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

3.  **Draw the line**:
    *   With at least two points, a straight line can be drawn through them to represent the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

#### Example: `y = -x + 2`

*   **y-intercept**: The y-intercept is `2`, meaning the line intersects the y-axis at `(0, 2)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
*   **Slope**: The coefficient of `x` is `-1`, so the slope is `-1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. This means as `x` increases by `1`, `y` decreases by `1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   The line will pass through `(0, 2)` and have a downward slope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

The [[slopeintercept_form_of_a_linear_equation | slope-intercept form]] is often considered the easiest form for understanding and visualizing the [[graphical_representation_of_linear_equations | graph]] of a linear equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

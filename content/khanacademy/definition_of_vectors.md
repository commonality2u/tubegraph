A vector is a concept that possesses both a magnitude (or size) and a direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This contrasts with a [[definition_of_scalars | scalar]], which only has a magnitude or size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Understanding the [[difference_between_vectors_and_scalars | difference between vectors and scalars]] is crucial in physics and mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Key Characteristics of Vectors

*   **Magnitude:** The size or numerical value of the vector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   **Direction:** The orientation or path along which the magnitude is applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Examples of Vector Quantities

[[examples_of_vectors_and_scalars_in_motion | Examples of vectors]] include displacement and velocity.

### Displacement

Displacement is a vector quantity that describes the change in an object's position, including both the distance moved (magnitude) and the direction of that movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

*   **Example:** If a brick is moved 5 meters to the right, "5 meters" represents the magnitude, and "to the right" specifies the direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. This complete description (5 meters to the right) makes it a vector quantity, specifically displacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **Contrast with Distance:** If one only states that the brick moved 5 meters, without specifying direction, it is a scalar quantity known as distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Distance tells you the size of the movement but not its direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

> "Distance is a [[definition_of_scalars | scalar]] quantity... Displacement is a [[definition_of_vectors | vector]] quantity." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>

### Velocity

Velocity is a vector quantity that describes how fast an object is moving and in what direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

*   **Example:** If a brick travels 5 meters to the right in 2 seconds, its velocity would be 2.5 meters per second to the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. Here, 2.5 meters per second is the magnitude, and "to the right" is the direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
*   **Contrast with Speed:** If only "2.5 meters per second" is given without direction, it is a scalar quantity known as speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. Speed only conveys how fast something is going, not its direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

> "If you're talking about how fast something is going, and you give the direction that it's going in, you're talking about velocity. If you don't give the direction you are talking about speed." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>

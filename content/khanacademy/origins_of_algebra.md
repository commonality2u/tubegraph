The term "algebra" and many of the concepts it now represents originate from a book written by a Persian mathematician in Baghdad around 820 AD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Etymology of "Algebra"

The word "algebra" comes from the Arabic title of [[al_khwarizmi_and_the_etymology_of_algebra | Al-Khwarizmi's]] book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The full English translation of the book's title is "The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

The Arabic word "algebra" means "restoration or completion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. In his book, [[al_khwarizmi_and_the_etymology_of_algebra | Al-Khwarizmi]] associated this term with the operation of moving a term from one side of an equation to the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

The components of the Arabic title break down as follows:
*   *Al-kitab*: Book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>
*   *Al-mukhtasar*: Compendious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>
*   *Fihisab*: Calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>
*   *Al-gabr*: Completion (the root of the word algebra) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>
*   *Wa'l-muqabala*: Balancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>

## Early [[historical_development_of_algebra | Historical Development of Algebra]]

While [[al_khwarizmi_and_the_etymology_of_algebra | Al-Khwarizmi's]] book is highly significant for the development and naming of algebra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>, he was not the first to explore algebraic ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. The region of Baghdad, where [[al_khwarizmi_and_the_etymology_of_algebra | Al-Khwarizmi]] lived, frequently appears in the [[historical_development_of_algebra | history of algebra]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

### Ancient Babylon (circa 2000 BCE)

The earliest known records of people exploring ideas foundational to algebra come from ancient Babylon, around 2000 years before the Common Era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Stone tablets from this period show that Babylonians were working on fundamental algebraic concepts, even though they used different symbols and number representations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. This region, also known as Mesopotamia (between two rivers), is recognized as the place where "real, real algebra" first began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

### Diophantus (circa 200-300 AD)

Around 200 to 300 AD, a Greek mathematician named Diophantus, living in Alexandria (part of the Roman Empire at the time), made [[significant_contributions_to_algebra_by_various_cultures | significant contributions to algebra]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Diophantus is sometimes credited as the "father of algebra," although this title is debated with [[al_khwarizmi_and_the_etymology_of_algebra | Al-Khwarizmi]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Diophantus's work focused more on particular problems, whereas [[al_khwarizmi_and_the_etymology_of_algebra | Al-Khwarizmi]] moved towards a more abstract way of thinking about mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. While the Babylonians predated them, both Diophantus and [[al_khwarizmi_and_the_etymology_of_algebra | Al-Khwarizmi]] offered unique contributions to what is now considered algebra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Many Western historians often associate Diophantus as the father of algebra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

### Brahmagupta (circa 600 AD)

Around 600 AD, Brahmagupta, a renowned Indian mathematician, also made [[significant_contributions_to_algebra_by_various_cultures | significant contributions to algebra]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

### Al-Khwarizmi (circa 820 AD)

[[al_khwarizmi_and_the_etymology_of_algebra | Al-Khwarizmi]], active in the 8th or 9th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, is definitively credited with giving the name "algebra" to the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. His book is considered highly important because it marked the first time that algebra began to incorporate many of its modern ideas, such as balancing equations and approaching problems in an abstract manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. He is often regarded as one of the "fathers of algebra" because of his focus on the [[application_of_abstraction_in_algebra | abstract]] nature of the field, separate from specific, one-off problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

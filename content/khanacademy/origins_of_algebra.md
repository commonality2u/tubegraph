The word "algebra" and its associated ideas originate from a book titled "The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This significant work was written by a Persian mathematician known as al-Khwarizmi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, who lived in Baghdad around 820 AD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Many consider this book to be the first instance where [[introduction_to_algebra | algebra]] began to embrace many of its modern concepts, such as the balancing of equations and an abstract approach to problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Etymology of "Algebra"

The term "algebra" comes from the Arabic word "Al-gabr" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, which means "restoration" or "completion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Al-Khwarizmi linked this term in his book to the operation of moving a term from one side of an equation to the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

The full Arabic title of his book can be broken down as follows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>:
*   "Al-kitab" - book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>
*   "Al-mukhtasar" - compendious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>
*   "Fihisab" - calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>
*   "Al-gabr" - restoration or completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>
*   "wa'l-muqabala" - balancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>

## [[historical_timeline_of_algebra | Historical Timeline of Algebra]]

While al-Khwarizmi is credited with the name "algebra" and significant contributions to its modern form, he was not the first to explore algebraic ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. The history of [[introduction_to_algebra | algebra]] spans several civilizations:

### Ancient Babylon (circa 2000 BCE)
The earliest known traces of people exploring fundamental ideas of [[introduction_to_algebra | algebra]] come from ancient Babylon, around 2000 years Before the Common Era (BCE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Stone tablets from this period reveal early explorations of algebraic concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Although they used different symbols and numerical representations, their work is recognized as [[introduction_to_algebra | algebra]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. This region, known as Mesopotamia, was a cradle for these early mathematical developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

### Diophantus (circa 200-300 AD)
Around 200 to 300 AD, a Greek mathematician named Diophantus, who lived in Alexandria (part of the Roman Empire at the time), made notable contributions to [[introduction_to_algebra | algebra]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. He is sometimes regarded as the "father of [[introduction_to_algebra | algebra]]" by Western historians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Diophantus's work was more focused on specific problems, contrasting with al-Khwarizmi's purer, more abstract approach to mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. Despite the earlier Babylonian contributions, Diophantus made unique contributions to what is now considered [[introduction_to_algebra | algebra]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

### [[brahmaguptas_influence_on_algebra | Brahmagupta]] (circa 600 AD)
Around 600 AD, another influential mathematician in the [[historical_timeline_of_algebra | history of algebra]] was [[brahmaguptas_influence_on_algebra | Brahmagupta]] from India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. He also made significant contributions to the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

### Al-Khwarizmi (circa 820 AD)
Al-Khwarizmi, who lived around the 8th or 9th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, is largely credited with giving [[introduction_to_algebra | algebra]] its name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. He is often considered one of the fathers of [[introduction_to_algebra | algebra]] because he began to conceptualize it in an abstract sense, moving beyond specific problems, aligning with how modern mathematicians approach the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. The debate over who truly is the "father of [[introduction_to_algebra | algebra]]" often comes down to Diophantus or al-Khwarizmi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

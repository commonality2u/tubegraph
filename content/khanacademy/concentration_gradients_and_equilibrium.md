The concepts of concentration, diffusion, and osmosis are fundamental to understanding how particles distribute themselves in a system, often leading to a state of [[market_equilibrium_and_equilibrium_price | equilibrium]]. These principles, while seemingly simple, can often be confusing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Basic Concepts: Solvent, Solute, and Solution

Imagine a container of water molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, with some sugar molecules dissolved within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

*   **[[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | Solvent]]**: The component present in greater quantity (e.g., water) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This can be viewed as the substance there is "more of" in terms of the number of molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Water is the most common solvent in biological or chemical systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
*   **[[basic_concepts_of_solvent_and_solute | Solute]]**: The component present in lesser quantity (e.g., sugar) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The solute is dissolved into the solvent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **Solution**: The combination of the solvent and the solute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. The solvent "does the dissolving," while the solute "is dissolved" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### Concentration

Concentration refers to how much of a particular particle exists per unit of space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   **High Concentration**: Many particles per unit space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
*   **Low Concentration**: Few particles per unit space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

## [[diffusion_in_gases_and_liquids | Diffusion]]

[[diffusion_in_gases_and_liquids | Diffusion]] is the process where particles or molecules spread out from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. This phenomenon is driven by the random kinetic energy of molecules, causing them to move and collide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Over time, particles naturally spread out to equalize their distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

### Examples of Diffusion

*   **Gases**: If gaseous oxygen is concentrated in one part of a container, its molecules will randomly move and collide, eventually spreading out to fill the entire container uniformly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Liquids (Solute Diffusion)**: If sugar molecules are dissolved in water on one side of a connected container, and the other side contains only water, the sugar molecules will gradually spread through the connection to the side with lower sugar concentration until concentrations are roughly equal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. This is based on the probability of molecules moving through the connection, favoring movement from higher to lower concentration areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

### [[hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | Hypertonic and Hypotonic Solutions]]

In the context of solute concentration:
*   **[[hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | Hypertonic Solution]]**: A solution with a higher concentration of solute relative to another solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. "Hyper" generally means having a lot of something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
*   **[[hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | Hypotonic Solution]]**: A solution with a lower concentration of solute relative to another solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. "Hypo" means not too much of something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

Therefore, [[diffusion_in_gases_and_liquids | diffusion]] of a solute occurs from a [[hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | hypertonic solution]] to a [[hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | hypotonic solution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

## [[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | Osmosis and Semipermeable Membranes]]

[[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | Osmosis]] is a specific type of [[diffusion_in_gases_and_liquids | diffusion]] involving the **solvent** (typically water) moving across a **semi-permeable membrane** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. A semi-permeable membrane allows certain molecules (like water) to pass through but blocks others (like larger solute molecules, such as sugar) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Permeable membranes allow substances to pass. Semi-permeable membranes are selectively permeable, allowing some substances but not others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

Consider a scenario where:
1.  An inside environment contains a [[hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | hypertonic solution]] (high solute concentration, e.g., sugar in water) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.
2.  An outside environment contains a [[hypotonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | hypotonic solution]] (low solute concentration, e.g., plain water) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.
3.  A semi-permeable membrane separates the two environments, allowing water to pass but blocking sugar molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

In this situation:
*   The solute (sugar) cannot diffuse to equalize concentrations because it is blocked by the membrane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.
*   However, the solvent (water) can move. Because the inside solution has many solute particles, these particles can statistically impede the exit of water molecules through the membrane's pores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.
*   Conversely, water molecules from the outside (hypotonic side) face no such impedance and are more likely to enter the membrane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.

This leads to a **net inward flow of water** from the [[hypotonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | hypotonic solution]] (low solute concentration, high water concentration) to the [[hypertonic_and_hypotonic_solutions | hypertonic solution]] (high solute concentration, low water concentration) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. This movement of water attempts to "equilibriate" the concentrations on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.

> [!INFO] Definition of [[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | Osmosis]]
> [[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | Osmosis]] is the [[diffusion_in_gases_and_liquids | diffusion]] of water (the solvent) through a semi-permeable membrane, typically in a context where the solute cannot pass through the membrane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>. This process aims to make the concentrations more equal by altering the solvent volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.

Ultimately, both [[diffusion_in_gases_and_liquids | diffusion]] and [[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | osmosis]] describe the probabilistic movement of molecules to spread out and achieve a state where concentrations are as balanced as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

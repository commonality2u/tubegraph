A second-degree polynomial, often referred to as a [[quadratic_polynomials | quadratic]] or [[quadratic_polynomials | quadratic expression]], contains a variable raised to the second power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This article focuses on [[factoring_quadratics | factoring]] these expressions, specifically when the leading coefficient (the coefficient of the x-squared term) is positive or negative.

## Understanding the Structure of Factored Quadratics

When a [[quadratic_polynomials | quadratic expression]] is [[factoring_quadratics | factored]] into the product of two binomials, such as `(x + a)` and `(x + b)`, expanding this product yields:
`x * x = x²` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>
`x * b = bx` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>
`a * x = ax` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>
`a * b = ab` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>

Combining like terms, the general form is `x² + (a + b)x + ab` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

From this general form, we can observe key relationships for [[understanding_components_of_a_quadratic_equation | quadratic equations]] in standard form (e.g., `Ax² + Bx + C` where `A=1`):
*   The [[understanding_and_working_with_coefficients | coefficient]] of the `x` term (`B`) is the sum of `a` and `b` (`a + b`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   The constant term (`C`) is the product of `a` and `b` (`a * b`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

To [[factoring_quadratics | factor]] a [[quadratic_polynomials | quadratic]], the goal is to find two numbers, `a` and `b`, that satisfy these conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. It's often assumed that `a` and `b` are integers, especially when beginning to [[factoring_quadratics | factor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## Factoring with a Positive Leading Coefficient (e.g., `x²`)

When the [[understanding_and_working_with_coefficients | coefficient]] of the `x²` term is `1`, the process involves identifying two numbers whose sum equals the `x` [[understanding_and_working_with_coefficients | coefficient]] and whose product equals the constant term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

### Case 1: Positive `x` coefficient and Positive Constant

If the `x` [[understanding_and_working_with_coefficients | coefficient]] and the constant term are both positive, then both `a` and `b` must be positive.
*   **Example:** `x² + 10x + 9` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>
    *   Find two numbers that multiply to `9` and add to `10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
    *   Factors of `9`: (1, 9), (3, 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
    *   (1 + 9) = 10. (1 * 9) = 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
    *   Factored form: `(x + 1)(x + 9)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

*   **Example:** `x² + 15x + 50` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>
    *   Find two numbers that multiply to `50` and add to `15` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
    *   Factors of `50`: (1, 50), (2, 25), (5, 10) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
    *   (5 + 10) = 15. (5 * 10) = 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
    *   Factored form: `(x + 5)(x + 10)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

### Case 2: Negative `x` coefficient and Positive Constant

If the constant term is positive but the `x` [[understanding_and_working_with_coefficients | coefficient]] is negative, both `a` and `b` must be negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. This is because their product is positive, but their sum is negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
*   **Example:** `x² - 11x + 24` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>
    *   Find two numbers that multiply to `24` and add to `-11` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
    *   Consider factors of `24`: (1, 24), (2, 12), (3, 8), (4, 6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
    *   Since `a` and `b` must be negative: (-3 * -8) = 24. (-3 + -8) = -11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
    *   Factored form: `(x - 3)(x - 8)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

### Case 3: Positive `x` coefficient and Negative Constant

If the constant term is negative, one of `a` or `b` must be positive, and the other negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. The sign of the `x` [[understanding_and_working_with_coefficients | coefficient]] indicates which factor (the one with larger or smaller absolute value) is positive or negative.
*   **Example:** `x² + 5x - 14` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>
    *   Find two numbers that multiply to `-14` and add to `5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
    *   Consider factors of `14`: (1, 14), (2, 7) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
    *   Since the sum is positive (`+5`), the larger absolute value should be positive.
    *   (-2 * 7) = -14. (-2 + 7) = 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
    *   Factored form: `(x - 2)(x + 7)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

### Case 4: Negative `x` coefficient and Negative Constant

Similar to the previous case, one of `a` or `b` must be positive and the other negative. The negative `x` [[understanding_and_working_with_coefficients | coefficient]] means the number with the larger absolute value should be negative.
*   **Example:** `x² - x - 56` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>
    *   Find two numbers that multiply to `-56` and add to `-1` (since `-x` is `-1x`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
    *   Consider factors of `56`: (1, 56), (2, 28), (4, 14), (7, 8) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.
    *   Since the sum is negative (`-1`), the larger absolute value should be negative.
    *   (-8 * 7) = -56. (-8 + 7) = -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.
    *   Factored form: `(x - 8)(x + 7)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

## Factoring with a Negative Leading Coefficient (e.g., `-x²`)

When the leading [[understanding_and_working_with_coefficients | coefficient]] is negative, the easiest [[methods_for_solving_quadratic_equations | method]] is to factor out `-1` from the entire [[quadratic_polynomials | quadratic expression]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. This transforms the problem into one with a positive leading [[understanding_and_working_with_coefficients | coefficient]], similar to the cases above.

*   **Example:** `-x² - 5x + 24` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>
    *   Factor out `-1`: `-1(x² + 5x - 24)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.
    *   Now, find two numbers that multiply to `-24` and add to `5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.
    *   Consider factors of `24`: (1, 24), (2, 12), (3, 8), (4, 6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.
    *   Since the product is negative, one factor is positive and one is negative. Since the sum is positive, the larger absolute value is positive.
    *   (-3 * 8) = -24. (-3 + 8) = 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.
    *   Factored form: `-1(x - 3)(x + 8)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

*   **Example:** `-x² + 18x - 72` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>
    *   Factor out `-1`: `-1(x² - 18x + 72)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.
    *   Now, find two numbers that multiply to `72` and add to `-18` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.
    *   Since the product is positive and the sum is negative, both numbers must be negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.
    *   Consider factors of `72`: (1, 72), (2, 36), (3, 24), (4, 18), (6, 12), (8, 9) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.
    *   (-6 * -12) = 72. (-6 + -12) = -18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.
    *   Factored form: `-1(x - 6)(x - 12)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>.

Finding the correct factors can be an "art" that develops with practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. It involves considering all factors, playing with positive and negative signs, and checking which combinations satisfy both the product and sum conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.

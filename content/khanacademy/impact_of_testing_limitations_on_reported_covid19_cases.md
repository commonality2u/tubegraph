The number of COVID-19 cases reported daily on the news represents the *reported* number, based on individuals who receive a test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This reported figure often significantly understates the [[difference_between_reported_and_actual_covid19_cases | actual number of cases]] due to various limitations, primarily insufficient testing capacity and the prevalence of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Discrepancy Between Reported and Actual Cases

The [[difference_between_reported_and_actual_covid19_cases | actual cases]] are likely "far larger" than the number of confirmed cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This discrepancy is evident when examining data from Hubei province, China, where Wuhan is located <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

On January 23rd, 2020, Hubei reported approximately 300 confirmed new cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. However, the estimated actual new cases for that day were close to 2,500, roughly eight times higher than the confirmed count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### How Actual Cases Were Estimated in Hubei

Chinese officials were able to estimate the [[difference_between_reported_and_actual_covid19_cases | actual new cases]] in hindsight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. When individuals tested positive, they were asked about the date their symptoms first appeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. If symptoms began ten days prior to testing, that case would be logged as an actual new case for that earlier date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

### Impact of Shutdown Measures

Wuhan was shut down on January 23rd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. While city officials were beginning to see confirmed cases, the [[difference_between_reported_and_actual_covid19_cases | actual cases]] were already much higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. The implementation of a [[effective_measures_to_control_covid19_spread | serious shutdown]] significantly slowed the virus's spread rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. A few days later, the actual cases, calculated in hindsight, began to flatten and then decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

Despite the decline in actual cases, the confirmed new cases continued to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This is due to a delay between when people show symptoms and when they are actually tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Without the [[effective_measures_to_control_covid19_spread | shutdown]], the [[analysis_of_covid19_spread_rates_and_mortality | exponential growth]] of cases would have continued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

### Cumulative Cases and Lagging Data

By January 22nd, before the city shutdown, the cumulative [[difference_between_reported_and_actual_covid19_cases | actual cases]] in Hubei totaled approximately 12,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. In contrast, the cumulative confirmed cases were only about 444 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. This highlights that even with "reasonably good testing" by Chinese standards at the time, the actual number of cases was far higher than reported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

## Testing Limitations in Other Regions

The ratio of actual to confirmed cases is likely even higher in areas like the United States, where testing was not as widespread or efficient as it was in China during the early stages of the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. As of March 3rd, 2020, the United States was not performing as many tests per million citizens compared to other nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. This means that reported cases in such regions "far understate" the [[difference_between_reported_and_actual_covid19_cases | actual number of cases]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

### Estimating Actual Cases Using Mortality Data

One method for [[estimating_actual_covid19_cases_using_mortality_data | estimating the actual number of cases]] in an area involves using the number of deaths, estimates of the mortality rate, the time from infection to death, and the virus's spread rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

*   **Mortality Rate**: A mortality rate of 1% can be assumed for estimation purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. This rate can vary (e.g., 0.6% in South Korea, 5% in Iran), often increasing where hospital systems are overwhelmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   **Time from Infection to Death**: This is estimated to be approximately 20 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>, comprising:
    *   Roughly 5 days from infection to symptom onset (incubation period) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
    *   Approximately 15 days from symptom onset to death for those who unfortunately succumb to the virus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   **Days to Doubling**: This indicates how quickly the infection doubles in the population, heavily influenced by population density and interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. A conservative estimate for the doubling rate could be five days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

If one death is reported in a region today, it implies the infection likely occurred 20 days ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. Given a 1% mortality rate, this suggests that 100 people were infected on that day 20 days prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. If the infection doubles every five days, the progression of cases would be:
*   20 days ago: 100 infected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>
*   15 days ago (5 days later): 200 cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>
*   10 days ago (another 5 days later): 400 cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>
*   5 days ago (another 5 days later): 800 cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>
*   Today (another 5 days later): Approximately 1600 cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>

This conservative estimate demonstrates how current reported data significantly lags the actual situation on the ground, especially in regions with limited testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

### Importance of Understanding the True Scale

Understanding the true [[difference_between_reported_and_actual_covid19_cases | scale of infection]], despite lagging reported data, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. Taking precautions such as [[effective_measures_to_control_covid19_spread | social isolation]] can lower the spread rate and prevent the overwhelming of hospital systems, which in turn helps keep the mortality rate as low as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. Complacency due to misleadingly low reported numbers could lead to hospital systems being overwhelmed, causing the mortality rate to increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

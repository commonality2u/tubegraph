From: [[khanacademy]] <br/> 
The terms "demand" and "quantity demanded" are distinct concepts in economics, though they are often confused in casual conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Understanding this [[difference_between_expressions_and_equations | distinction]] is crucial for grasping core economic principles.

## The Law of Demand
The [[law_of_demand | law of demand]] is a fundamental concept in [[microeconomics_vs_macroeconomics | microeconomics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. It states that if the price of a product increases, the [[impact_of_price_changes_on_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] for that product will decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Conversely, if the price of a product decreases, the [[impact_of_price_changes_on_quantity_demanded | quantity demanded]] will increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. While generally true, there are some exceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Quantity Demanded
When discussing an actual quantity of a product that people are willing to buy at a specific price, economists use the term "quantity demanded" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. It refers to a single point on a demand curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Changes in price, while holding all other factors constant (`ceteris paribus`), lead to a change in the quantity demanded, which is represented as a movement *along* the existing demand curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

## Demand
In a formal economic sense, "demand" does not refer to a quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Instead, "demand" represents the entire relationship between various prices and the corresponding quantities demanded, assuming all other factors remain constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This comprehensive relationship can be illustrated in two ways:

### Demand Schedule
A [[demand_schedule_and_demand_curve | demand schedule]] is a table that shows how the price of a product relates to its quantity demanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. For example, considering the demand for an ebook called "Space Whatever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>:

| Scenario | Price ($) | Quantity Demanded (Units) |
| :------- | :-------- | :------------------------ |
| A        | 2         | 60,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>         |
| B        | 4         | 40,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>         |
| C        | 6         | 30,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>         |
| D        | 8         | 25,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>         |
| E        | 10        | 23,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>         |

This table itself represents the demand for the ebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>, illustrating the [[law_of_demand | law of demand]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

### Demand Curve
A [[graphing_the_demand_curve | demand curve]] is a graphical representation of the [[demand_schedule_and_demand_curve | demand schedule]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. It plots the relationship between price and quantity demanded on a graph. By convention in economics, price is typically placed on the vertical axis, and quantity demanded is placed on the horizontal axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

For the "Space Whatever" ebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>:
- Price (vertical axis) ranges from $2 to $10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
- Quantity demanded (horizontal axis) ranges from 23,000 to 60,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

When these points are plotted and connected, they form a continuous curve, which is the demand curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. This curve captures all possible price-quantity demanded combinations, not just the specific scenarios listed in the schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

The entire demand curve itself represents the demand for the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. If demand itself were to change (due to factors other than price), the entire curve would shift, resulting in a different relationship between price and quantity demanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

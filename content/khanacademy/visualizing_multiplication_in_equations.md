When solving equations involving multiplication, understanding what the equation represents is key. This article explores how to visualize and systematically solve such equations, particularly those in the form of `ax = b`.

## Understanding the Notation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>

An equation like `7x = 14` is the same as saying "7 times x equals 14" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. In algebra, the multiplication sign is often omitted when a number is written next to a variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This is a shorthand notation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

The traditional multiplication sign (×) is generally avoided in algebra because the variable 'x' is so commonly used, leading to potential confusion (e.g., looking like "xx" or "times times") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Sometimes a dot (·) is used to represent multiplication, like `7 · x = 14` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, but simply writing `7x` is the most common notation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Solving by Inspection

For simple equations, you might be able to solve them by recalling your times tables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. For `7x = 14`, you could think: "7 times 1 is 7, 7 times 2 is 14" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, leading to `x = 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Systematic Approach through [[Visualizing algebraic operations | Visualization]]

While mental math works for simple cases, a systematic approach is crucial as equations become more complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. It's important to understand not just how to manipulate equations but what they represent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

### Example 1: `7x = 14`

To understand how to manipulate this equation, we can [[visual_representation_of_equations | visualize]] it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

*   **Interpreting `7x`**: The term `7x` literally means 'x' added to itself 7 times. This is the fundamental definition of [[multiplication_as_repeated_addition | multiplication]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
    *   `7x` can be visualized as: `x + x + x + x + x + x + x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Equating Sides**: The equation states that `7x` is equal to 14 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. So, `x + x + x + x + x + x + x` is equivalent to 14 individual objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **Solving by Division**: The standard systematic step is to divide both sides by the coefficient (the number multiplying the variable) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. In this case, divide both sides by 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
    *   `(7x) / 7 = 14 / 7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>
    *   The 7s on the left side cancel out, leaving `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
    *   `14 / 7 = 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
    *   Therefore, `x = 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Visualizing the Division**: Dividing both sides by 7 means you're taking the `7x` quantity and splitting it into 7 equal groups, and doing the same for the `14` quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
    *   If 7 'x's combined are equal to 14 objects, then dividing both into 7 groups means each 'x' group corresponds to two objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. This confirms `x = 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **Rule of Equality**: Whatever operation is performed on one side of an equation must also be performed on the other side to maintain equality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

### Example 2: `3x = 15`

Let's apply the systematic approach:
1.  **Identify the coefficient**: The coefficient of `x` is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
2.  **Divide both sides by the coefficient**:
    *   `3x / 3 = 15 / 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>
    *   This simplifies to `x = 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

Alternatively, dividing by 3 is equivalent to multiplying by 1/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
*   Multiply both sides by 1/3:
    *   `(1/3) * 3x = (1/3) * 15` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>
    *   `1x = 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>
    *   `x = 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>

### Example 3: `2y + 4y = 18`

This equation is a bit more complex, but can be simplified first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

*   **Visualize and combine like terms**:
    *   `2y` means `y + y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
    *   `4y` means `y + y + y + y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
    *   Combined, `(y + y) + (y + y + y + y)` gives a total of six `y`'s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
    *   This is analogous to "2 apples plus 4 apples equals 6 apples" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
*   **Simplify the equation**:
    *   The equation becomes `6y = 18` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
*   **Solve by division**:
    *   Divide both sides by the coefficient, 6:
        *   `6y / 6 = 18 / 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>
        *   This yields `y = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
*   **Check the answer**: Always verify your solution by plugging the value back into the original equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
    *   `2 * 3 + 4 * 3 = 6 + 12 = 18` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
    *   Since `18 = 18`, the solution is correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

[[understanding_the_concept_of_slope | Slope]] is a fundamental concept in mathematics that describes how steep a line is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. For a straight line, its [[Slope of a Straight Line | slope]] remains constant throughout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Defining Slope

The most effective way to understand [[understanding_the_concept_of_slope | slope]] is to view it as the ratio of the "change in y" to the "change in x" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

$$ \text{Slope} = \frac{\text{Change in y}}{\text{Change in x}} $$

This relationship can also be expressed using the Greek capital letter delta (Δ), which signifies "change in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>:

$$ \text{Slope} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} $$

This means we are looking at how much the y-value changes for a given change in the x-value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## [[finding_the_slope_of_a_line | Finding the Slope of a Line]] from a Graph

To [[finding_the_slope_of_a_line | find the slope of a line]] from a graph, you can pick any two points on the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. It's often easiest to choose points with integer coordinates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

### Example 1: Calculating Positive Slope

Consider starting at a point (e.g., (-3, -3)) and moving to another point (e.g., (0, -1)) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

1.  **Change in X (Δx)**: Move from the starting x-value to the ending x-value. If starting at -3 and moving to 0, the change in x is +3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This can be seen by counting 3 steps to the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
    *   Δx = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>

2.  **Change in Y (Δy)**: Move from the starting y-value to the ending y-value. If starting at -3 and moving up to -1, the change in y is +2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This can be seen by counting 2 steps up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
    *   Δy = 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>

3.  **Calculate Slope**: Divide the change in y by the change in x.
    *   Slope = Δy / Δx = 2 / 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>

### Example 2: Demonstrating [[consistency_in_calculating_slope | Consistency in Calculating Slope]]

You can choose any two points on the line and still get the same slope, as long as you are [[consistency_in_calculating_slope | consistent]] in your direction of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

Consider starting at a different point (e.g., (3, 1)) and moving to (-3, -3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

1.  **Change in Y (Δy)**: Moving from y=1 down to y=-3. This is a decrease of 4 units.
    *   Δy = -4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>

2.  **Change in X (Δx)**: Moving from x=3 to x=-3. This is a decrease of 6 units (moving to the left).
    *   Δx = -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>

3.  **Calculate Slope**:
    *   Slope = Δy / Δx = -4 / -6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>
    *   The negatives cancel out, resulting in 4/6, which simplifies to 2/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

This demonstrates that regardless of which two points are chosen or the direction of travel along the line, the [[Slope of a line in algebra | slope]] will always be the same value, provided [[consistency_in_calculating_slope | consistency]] is maintained in how changes in x and y are measured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

The goal of analyzing COVID-19 data, particularly from Hubei province, is to better [[estimating_actual_covid_19_cases_based_on_deaths | estimate the actual new COVID-19 cases per day]] in a given area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This analysis draws heavily from work by Thomas Pueyo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. It is crucial to understand the [[difference_between_confirmed_and_actual_covid_19_cases | difference between reported (confirmed) and actual cases]] because reported numbers are based on people who get tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>, while many people might not have severe symptoms or haven't been tested yet, meaning actual cases are likely far larger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.

## Hubei Province Case Study

An [[analysis_of_covid_19_data_from_hubei_province | analysis of COVID-19 data from Hubei province]], where Wuhan is located, provides a clear illustration of the impact of shutdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.

*   **Data Representation**
    *   The vertical axis indicates the number of cases per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.
    *   Yellow bars represent confirmed new cases (people tested positive) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.
    *   Gray bars represent the actual number of new cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.
    *   For example, on January 23rd, confirmed new cases were about 300, but the actual new cases were close to 2,500, roughly eight times higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.
    *   Actual case numbers were determined in hindsight by asking those who tested positive when they first experienced symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

### Impact of Wuhan Shutdown

Wuhan was shut down on January 23rd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.

*   **Pre-Shutdown vs. Post-Shutdown:** Before the shutdown, while city officials were starting to see confirmed cases, the actual number of cases was far higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.
*   **Slowing the Spread:** The city shutdown significantly slowed down the spread rate of the virus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.
*   **Lag in Confirmed Cases:** A few days after the shutdown, the actual cases (calculated in hindsight) began to flatten out and then decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. However, the confirmed new cases continued to rise due to a delay between symptom onset and testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.
*   **Prevention of Exponential Growth:** Wuhan's situation eventually improved due to this "very serious shutdown" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. Without it, the exponential growth of the virus would have continued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.

## Understanding the Lag

It's important to differentiate between new cases per day and the total number of cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. To find the total number of cases at a given point, one would sum up the daily actual or confirmed cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.

*   As of January 22nd (before the shutdown), the total actual cases in Hubei Province were approximately 12,000, while total confirmed cases were only about 444 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.
*   This demonstrates that before the shutdown, even with reasonable testing by Chinese officials, the actual number of cases was far higher than what confirmed numbers suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.
*   The ratio of actual to confirmed cases on a given day was likely even higher in other geographies, such as the United States, which had not been testing as extensively as China did by March 3rd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>. The number of reported cases in areas like the US was significantly understating the actual number of cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

The analysis of Hubei province data underscores the critical role of strong public health measures like shutdowns in controlling the spread of COVID-19. It also highlights the significant lag between the true situation on the ground and the officially reported data, especially in areas with limited testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. Taking all precautions, such as social isolation, can lower the spread rate, prevent the hospital system from being overwhelmed, and help keep the [[factors_influencing_covid_19_mortality_rate | mortality rate as low as possible]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>. Failure to take precautions could lead to hospital systems being overwhelmed, causing the mortality rate to increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:00">[12:25:00]</a>.

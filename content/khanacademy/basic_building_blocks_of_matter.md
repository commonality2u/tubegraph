Chemistry, as a science, helps us understand and make models and predictions about our reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. It addresses the overwhelming complexity observed in the universe, from fire and rock to water, meteorological patterns, and the electrochemical interactions within the human brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## The Underlying Simplicity
Over thousands of years, humanity has begun to make sense of this complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. A key realization is that despite apparent infinite differences in substances, everything is made of basic building blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. These can be imagined as "Legos" that constitute everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Crucially, there isn't an infinite number of these building blocks; there is a finite number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## Elements and Subatomic Particles
These fundamental building blocks are known as [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | elements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. Many seemingly different things in the world are simply different compositions of [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | elements]] like carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

Furthermore, the [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | elements]] themselves are composed of even smaller particles: [[structure_and_components_of_atoms | protons and electrons and neutrons]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. These [[structure_and_components_of_atoms | protons and electrons and neutrons]] are rearranged in different ways to form various [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | elements]], each possessing distinct [[differences_in_substances_and_their_properties | properties]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Significance in Science
Chemistry focuses on understanding how these building blocks interact to explain a wide range of phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. This includes concepts like combustion, where hydrogen and oxygen combine to produce energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Biology, for instance, is built upon chemistry, as biological processes, such as human speech, are based on molecular interactions between [[elements_and_their_basic_units_atoms | atoms]] and molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

Understanding the basic building blocks of matter allows us to create models that describe the complexity of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a> and to make predictions about interactions at scales and speeds that cannot be directly observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

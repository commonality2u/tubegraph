When performing addition or subtraction with fractions that have different denominators, the first crucial step is to find a common denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This means transforming the fractions so they share the same bottom number.

## Why a Common Denominator?
Fractions represent parts of a whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. To accurately add or subtract them, they must represent parts of the *same* whole or of equally sized divisions. For instance, you cannot directly add 4/9 and 11/12 because the "ninths" are not the same size as the "twelfths" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## How to Find a Common Denominator
The goal is to find a number that both of the original denominators can divide into evenly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This number is known as a [[least_common_multiple_of_denominators | least common multiple]] (LCM) of the denominators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The LCM is the smallest common multiple of both numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

### Method: Listing Multiples
One way to find the [[least_common_multiple_of_denominators | least common multiple]] is to list multiples of the larger denominator until you find one that is also divisible by the smaller denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

**Example**: Finding the common denominator for 4/9 and 11/12:
1.  **Identify denominators**: The denominators are 9 and 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
2.  **List multiples of the larger denominator (12)**:
    *   12 (not divisible by 9)
    *   24 (not divisible by 9)
    *   36 (divisible by 9: 9 x 4 = 36; and by 12: 12 x 3 = 36) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>
3.  **The common denominator is 36** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Converting Fractions to the Common Denominator
Once the common denominator is found, each fraction must be rewritten as an equivalent fraction with this new denominator.

To do this, determine what number you multiplied the original denominator by to get the common denominator. Then, multiply the numerator by the exact same number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This ensures the value of the fraction remains unchanged.

**Example**: Converting 4/9 and 11/12 to have a denominator of 36:
*   **For 4/9**:
    *   To change 9 into 36, you multiply by 4 (9 x 4 = 36) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
    *   Multiply the numerator (4) by the same number (4 x 4 = 16) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
    *   So, 4/9 becomes 16/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **For 11/12**:
    *   To change 12 into 36, you multiply by 3 (12 x 3 = 36) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
    *   Multiply the numerator (11) by the same number (11 x 3 = 33) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
    *   So, 11/12 becomes 33/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

Now, both fractions (16/36 and 33/36) have the same denominator and are ready for addition or subtraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## Next Steps
After finding a common denominator and converting the fractions, the process of [[adding_fractions_with_the_same_denominator | adding fractions]] or [[subtracting_fractions_with_the_same_denominator | subtracting fractions]] becomes straightforward:

1.  **Add/Subtract Numerators**: Add or subtract the new numerators, keeping the common denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
2.  **Simplify**: If the resulting fraction is an [[finding_common_factors_in_fractions | improper fraction]] (numerator larger than denominator) or can be reduced, convert it to a mixed number or simplify it to its lowest terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

When performing operations like [[adding_fractions_with_different_denominators | adding fractions]] or [[subtracting_fractions_with_different_denominators | subtracting fractions]] that have different denominators, the first crucial step is to make their denominators the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This new, shared denominator is called a common denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Why is a Common Denominator Needed?

Fractions represent parts of a whole. To add or subtract parts, they must be of the same "type" or "size," meaning they must refer to the same total number of equal parts. For example, you cannot directly add 4/9 and 11/12 because the "ninths" and "twelfths" are different sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. By finding a common denominator, you convert both fractions into equivalent forms that share the same denominator, allowing for direct addition or subtraction of their numerators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## How to Find a Common Denominator

A common denominator is a number that both original denominators will divide into <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The most efficient common denominator to find is the [[least_common_multiple | least common multiple]] (LCM) of the denominators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The LCM is the smallest multiple common to both numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

### Method: Listing Multiples

One way to find the [[least_common_multiple | least common multiple]] (and thus the [[least_common_multiple | least common denominator]]) is by listing the multiples of each denominator until a common one is found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

**Example: Finding a common denominator for 4/9 and 11/12** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>

1.  **List multiples of 9:**
    *   9 (not divisible by 12) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>
    *   18 (not divisible by 12) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>
    *   27 (not divisible by 12) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>
    *   36 (divisible by 12; 12 × 3 = 36) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>

    Since 36 is the first multiple of 9 that is also a multiple of 12, 36 is the [[least_common_multiple | least common denominator]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

2.  **Rewrite fractions with the common denominator:**
    *   To change 4/9 to a denominator of 36, multiply the denominator (9) by 4 (9 × 4 = 36) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. To keep the fraction equivalent, you must also multiply the numerator (4) by the same factor (4 × 4 = 16) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
        > So, 4/9 becomes 16/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
    *   To change 11/12 to a denominator of 36, multiply the denominator (12) by 3 (12 × 3 = 36) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Multiply the numerator (11) by the same factor (11 × 3 = 33) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
        > So, 11/12 becomes 33/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

Now, both fractions, 16/36 and 33/36, have the same denominator and can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
```
16/36 + 33/36 = (16 + 33) / 36 = 49/36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>
```

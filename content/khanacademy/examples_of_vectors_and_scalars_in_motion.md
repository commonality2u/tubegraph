Understanding the [[difference between vectors and scalars | difference between vectors and scalars]] is fundamental in physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. While they might sound complex, these are actually simple ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Definitions

*   A [[definition of vectors | vector]] is a quantity that possesses both a magnitude (size) and a direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   A [[definition of scalars | scalar]] is a quantity that only has a magnitude, or size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

Examples often make these concepts clearer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Examples in Motion

Consider moving a brick on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### Distance (Scalar)

If a brick is moved 5 meters, and no direction is specified, this measurement of "5 meters" represents the **distance** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   Distance is a [[definition of scalars | scalar quantity]] because it only indicates the size or magnitude of the movement (5 meters) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   It does not specify whether the brick moved left, right, up, or down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

### Displacement (Vector)

If the brick is moved 5 meters **to the right**, this is a measure of **displacement** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   Displacement is a [[definition of vectors | vector quantity]] because it includes both the magnitude (5 meters) and the direction (to the right) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   It precisely describes the change in position, including the path's orientation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### Speed (Scalar)

If the brick travels 5 meters in 2 seconds, its rate of movement is 2.5 meters per second (5m / 2s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
*   This quantity, 2.5 meters per second, is **speed** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   Speed is a [[definition of scalars | scalar quantity]] because it tells you "how fast" something is going (magnitude) without specifying a direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

### Velocity (Vector)

If the brick travels 5 meters to the right in 2 seconds, its rate of movement is 2.5 meters per second to the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.
*   This quantity is **velocity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   Velocity is a [[definition of vectors | vector quantity]] because it includes both the magnitude of the speed (2.5 meters per second) and the direction (to the right) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

[[introduction_to_geometry_terms | Geometry]] is the study and understanding of how shapes and space relate to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The word "geometry" itself originates from "geo" (earth) and "metry" (measurement), effectively meaning "earth measurement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This field explores concepts like lines, triangles, circles, and angles, and also encompasses patterns and [[twodimensional_and_threedimensional_space | three-dimensional shapes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Fundamental Concepts

### Point
A point is a basic starting block in [[introduction_to_geometry_terms | geometry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. It represents a specific position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   **Properties**: A point has [[understanding_points_and_dimensions | zero dimensions]], meaning one cannot move on a point; if movement occurs in any direction, it's no longer the same point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Labeling**: Points are typically labeled with capital letters (e.g., Point A, Point B) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### Line Segment
A [[line_segments_and_their_properties | line segment]] consists of all points that connect two specific points along a straight path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **Properties**: A [[line_segments_and_their_properties | line segment]] is a [[twodimensional_and_threedimensional_space | one-dimensional]] object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. It has a definable length but no width <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Movement is only possible back and forth along its path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
*   **Endpoints**: The two points connecting the [[line_segments_and_their_properties | line segment]] are called its endpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Labeling**: A [[line_segments_and_their_properties | line segment]] is labeled using its two endpoints with a line drawn over them (e.g., $\overline{AB}$ or $\overline{BA}$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. The length of the segment is denoted by simply writing the endpoints (e.g., $AB = 5$ units) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

### Ray
A ray starts at a specific point (its vertex) and extends infinitely in one direction through another point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   **Properties**: Like a [[line_segments_and_their_properties | line segment]], a ray is a [[twodimensional_and_threedimensional_space | one-dimensional]] figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   **Vertex**: The starting point of a ray is called its vertex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   **Labeling**: A ray is denoted by its vertex and another point it passes through, with an arrow drawn over them indicating the direction of infinite extension (e.g., $\overrightarrow{AD}$). The order of letters matters, as $\overrightarrow{DA}$ would represent a different ray starting at D and going past A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

### Line
A line extends infinitely in both directions through two given points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   **Properties**: A line is a [[twodimensional_and_threedimensional_space | one-dimensional]] concept that never ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   **Labeling**: A line is specified by two points it passes through, with arrows drawn over them to indicate infinite extension in both directions (e.g., $\overleftrightarrow{EF}$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

## Related Concepts

### Collinear Points
Points are considered **collinear** if they all lie on the same straight line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. For example, if X, Y, and Z are on the same line, they are collinear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

### Midpoint
The midpoint of a [[line_segments_and_their_properties | line segment]] is the point that lies exactly halfway between its two endpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. If point Z is the midpoint of [[line_segments_and_their_properties | line segment]] XY, then the distance from X to Z is equal to the distance from Z to Y (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>).

## Dimensions

*   **Zero Dimensions**: A point has [[understanding_points_and_dimensions | zero dimensions]] as no movement is possible while staying on the point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   **One Dimension**: [[line_segments_and_their_properties | Line segments]], rays, and lines are [[twodimensional_and_threedimensional_space | one-dimensional]] objects, allowing movement only back and forth along a single direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.
*   **Two Dimensions**: A [[twodimensional_and_threedimensional_space | two-dimensional]] object, like a screen or a plane, allows movement in two different directions (e.g., left/right and up/down) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. A geometrical plane is a flat surface that extends infinitely in every direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.
*   **Three Dimensions**: [[twodimensional_and_threedimensional_space | Three-dimensional]] space includes movement in three distinct directions (e.g., left/right, up/down, and in/out of a screen) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. Beyond three dimensions, visualization becomes difficult, but higher dimensions are studied in advanced mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

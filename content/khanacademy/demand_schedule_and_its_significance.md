A demand schedule is a fundamental concept in microeconomics, serving as a table that illustrates the relationship between the price of a product and its quantity demanded, assuming all other factors remain equal (ceteris paribus) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:02">[02:02:02]</a>. It is a core component for understanding the [[law_of_demand_in_microeconomics | law of demand]] and for [[drawing_and_interpreting_the_demand_curve | drawing demand curves]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.

## What is a Demand Schedule?

In economics, the term "demand" formally refers to the entire relationship between price and quantity demanded, not just a specific quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. A demand schedule captures this relationship in a tabular format, showing how many units of a product consumers are willing and able to purchase at various price points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. It highlights how the [[impact_of_price_changes_on_supply_and_demand | quantity demanded]] changes relative to the price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.

## Illustrative Example: 'Space Whatever' Ebook

Consider a hypothetical science fiction ebook titled "Space Whatever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. A demand schedule for this ebook might look like this:

| Scenario | Price (USD) | Quantity Demanded (Units) |
| :------- | :---------- | :------------------------ |
| A        | $2          | 60,000                    |
| B        | $4          | 40,000                    |
| C        | $6          | 30,000                    |
| D        | $8          | 25,000                    |
| E        | $10         | 23,000                    |

This table, a demand schedule, explicitly shows the relationship between price and the number of ebooks consumers are willing to download at each price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

## Connecting to the [[law_of_demand_in_microeconomics | Law of Demand]]

The data presented in a demand schedule directly demonstrates the [[law_of_demand_in_microeconomics | law of demand]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. This law states that:
*   If the price of a product is raised, the quantity demanded for that product will generally decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
*   Conversely, if the price of a product is lowered, the quantity demanded of that product will generally increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.

As seen in the "Space Whatever" example:
*   When the price increased from $2 to $4, the quantity demanded dropped from 60,000 to 40,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.
*   Further increases in price to $6, $8, and $10 correspond to further decreases in quantity demanded to 30,000, 25,000, and 23,000 respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.

## From Schedule to [[drawing_and_interpreting_the_demand_curve | Demand Curve]]

A demand schedule can be used to [[drawing_and_interpreting_the_demand_curve | draw a demand curve]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>. By plotting the price on the vertical axis and the quantity demanded on the horizontal axis, each scenario from the schedule becomes a point on a graph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. Connecting these points forms the demand curve, which represents the continuous relationship between price and quantity demanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>. This curve allows for the visualization of quantities demanded at prices not explicitly listed in the discrete demand schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.

## Key Distinction: [[difference_between_quantity_demanded_and_demand | Demand vs. Quantity Demanded]]

It is crucial to differentiate between "demand" and "quantity demanded" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>:
*   **Quantity Demanded** refers to a specific amount of a product that consumers are willing to buy at a particular price, holding all other factors constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. When only the price changes, causing movement along the demand curve, it is the quantity demanded that changes, not the demand itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>.
*   **Demand** refers to the entire relationship between price and quantity demanded, as represented by the entire demand schedule or the entire demand curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. If factors other than price change (e.g., income, tastes, prices of related goods), the entire demand relationship shifts, meaning the entire demand curve would shift or the entries in the demand schedule would change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.

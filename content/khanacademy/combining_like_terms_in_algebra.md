When solving algebraic equations, it's often necessary to simplify [[mathematical_expressions|mathematical expressions]] by [[combining_like_terms|combining like terms]]. This process involves grouping terms that contain the same variable raised to the same power.

## Understanding the Concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>
Consider the equation:
`2y + 4y = 18` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>

This equation means "2 times some number 'y' plus 4 times that same number 'y' equals 18" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. While it might be harder to solve this in your head initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>, a systematic approach involves [[combining_like_terms|combining like terms]].

## Visualizing Like Terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>
To better [[visualizing_algebraic_operations|visualize algebraic operations]], consider what `2y` and `4y` represent:
*   `2y` literally means `y + y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   `4y` literally means `y + y + y + y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

So, the expression `2y + 4y` can be seen as `(y + y) + (y + y + y + y)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
If you count all the 'y' terms, you have six 'y's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

## How to Combine Like Terms
The fundamental principle of [[combining_like_terms|combining like terms]] is straightforward: if you have 2 apples plus 4 apples, you get 6 apples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. Similarly, if you have 2 'y's plus 4 'y's, you will have 6 'y's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

Applying this to the equation:
`2y + 4y = 18`
can be simplified to:
`6y = 18` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>

## Solving After Combining Terms
Once like terms are combined, the equation becomes simpler to solve using standard [[using_algebraic_steps_to_solve_equations|algebraic steps]]. To isolate 'y' in `6y = 18`, you divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient (the number multiplying the variable), which is 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>:

`6y / 6 = 18 / 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>
`y = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>

You can always check your answer by substituting the value back into the original equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>:
`2(3) + 4(3) = 6 + 12 = 18` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>
This confirms the solution is correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

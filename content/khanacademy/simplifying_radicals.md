[[Simplifying Radicals | Simplifying radicals]] involves rewriting radical expressions in their simplest form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## What is a Radical?

A radical is typically represented by the square root symbol (âˆš) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. It's often referred to as the square root symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Understanding Radical Simplification

[[Simplifying Radicals | Simplifying radicals]] is an extension of [[using_exponents_in_radical_simplification | exponent rules]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The square root of a number is equivalent to raising that number to the 1/2 power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

For example, the square root of 72 can be written as `(36 * 2)^(1/2)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. According to [[using_exponents_in_radical_simplification | exponent rules]], `(A * B)^n` is equal to `A^n * B^n` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Therefore, `(36 * 2)^(1/2)` is the same as `36^(1/2) * 2^(1/2)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, which translates back to the square root of 36 times the square root of 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

Since the square root of 36 is 6, the expression [[Simplifying Radicals | simplifies]] to `6 * sqrt(2)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Method for Simplifying

The key to [[Simplifying Radicals | simplifying radicals]] is to find the largest factor of the number under the radical sign that is a perfect square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

**Common Perfect Squares:**
Perfect squares are numbers that result from squaring an integer. Some common perfect squares include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>:
*   1 (`1*1`)
*   4 (`2*2`)
*   9 (`3*3`)
*   16 (`4*4`)
*   25 (`5*5`)
*   36 (`6*6`)
*   49 (`7*7`)
*   64 (`8*8`)

If any of these numbers are a factor of the number under the radical, you should factor them out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

### Example 8: 7 times the Square Root of 320 (Multi-step simplification)
*   **Problem:** `7 * sqrt(320)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>
*   **Solution:**
    *   Break down 320. Although 64 is the largest perfect square factor, you can start with a smaller one you recognize, like 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
    *   Rewrite as `7 * sqrt(16 * 20)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
    *   Separate into `7 * sqrt(16) * sqrt(20)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
    *   [[Simplifying Radicals | Simplify]] `sqrt(16)` to 4, so `7 * 4 * sqrt(20) = 28 * sqrt(20)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
    *   The number under the radical, 20, can be further factored: `4 * 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.
    *   Rewrite as `28 * sqrt(4 * 5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
    *   Separate into `28 * sqrt(4) * sqrt(5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
    *   [[Simplifying Radicals | Simplify]] `sqrt(4)` to 2, so `28 * 2 * sqrt(5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
    *   Final result: `56 * sqrt(5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
    *   This process continues until the number under the radical cannot be reduced anymore by a perfect square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

## What is a Radical?

A radical is typically referred to as the square root symbol (√) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## What Does it Mean to Simplify a Radical?

Simplifying a radical involves rewriting it in a form where the number under the radical sign has no perfect square factors other than 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. While some might argue it makes the expression more complicated, it's a standard process in mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## The Core Principle: Exponent Rules

[[exponent_rules_and_radicals | Simplifying radicals]] is an extension of [[exponent_rules_and_radicals | exponent rules]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. The square root of a number is equivalent to raising that number to the 1/2 power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

For example:
*   The square root of (36 * 2) can be written as (36 * 2)^(1/2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   According to [[exponent_rules_and_radicals | exponent rules]], when two numbers multiplied together are raised to a power, it's the same as raising each number to that power and then multiplying them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   So, (36 * 2)^(1/2) = 36^(1/2) * 2^(1/2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   This translates back to the square root of 36 times the square root of 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## How to Simplify Radicals

The key to [[step_by_step_radical_simplification_examples | simplifying radicals]] is to identify perfect square factors within the number under the radical sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

### Steps:
1.  **Find a perfect square factor:** Look for the largest factor of the number under the radical that is a perfect square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Common perfect squares include 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, etc. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
2.  **Rewrite the expression:** Express the number under the radical as a product of the perfect square and another factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
3.  **Separate the radicals:** Use the rule √ab = √a * √b <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
4.  **Simplify the perfect square:** Take the square root of the perfect square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
5.  **Multiply:** Multiply the result by any number already outside the radical and the remaining radical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

### [[step_by_step_radical_simplification_examples | Simplification Examples]]

#### Example 1: Square root of 36
*   √36 = 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>

#### Example 2: Square root of 72
*   √72 = √(36 * 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>
*   = √36 * √2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>
*   = 6 * √2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>

#### Example 3: Square root of 50
*   √50 = √(25 * 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>
*   = √25 * √2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>
*   = 5 * √2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>

#### Example 4: 7 times the square root of 27
*   7√27 = 7 * √(9 * 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>
*   = 7 * √9 * √3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>
*   = 7 * 3 * √3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>
*   = 21√3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>

#### Example 5: 9 times the square root of 18
*   9√18 = 9 * √(2 * 9) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>
*   = 9 * √2 * √9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>
*   = 9 * √2 * 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>
*   = 27√2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>

#### Example 6: 4 times the square root of 25
*   Since 25 is a perfect square, √25 = 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   4√25 = 4 * 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>
*   = 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>

#### Example 7: 3 times the square root of 29
*   29 is a prime number, with only factors 1 and 29 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   Neither 1 nor 29 are perfect squares (other than 1, which doesn't simplify the expression) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   Therefore, 3√29 is already in its completely simplified form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

#### Example 8: 7 times the square root of 320 (Multi-step Simplification)
For larger numbers, you can simplify in steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
*   7√320
*   Recognize that 16 is a factor of 320 (320 = 16 * 20) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
*   = 7 * √(16 * 20) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>
*   = 7 * √16 * √20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>
*   = 7 * 4 * √20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>
*   = 28√20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>

*   Now, look at √20. It can be factored further because 20 = 4 * 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   = 28 * √(4 * 5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>
*   = 28 * √4 * √5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>
*   = 28 * 2 * √5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>
*   = 56√5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>

The process continues until the number under the radical can no longer be divided by a perfect square (other than 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. This often results in a prime number under the radical, but not always <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

Simplifying radicals relies on understanding [[exponent_rules_and_radicals | exponent rules]] and recognizing perfect squares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

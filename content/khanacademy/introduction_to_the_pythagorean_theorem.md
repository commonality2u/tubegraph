The [[introduction_to_the_pythagorean_theorem | Pythagorean theorem]] is a fundamental concept in mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. It is particularly useful in [[introduction_to_geometry_terms | geometry]] and serves as the backbone of [[introduction_to_basic_trigonometry | trigonometry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Additionally, it can be used to calculate distances between points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Definition of the Pythagorean Theorem

The [[introduction_to_the_pythagorean_theorem | Pythagorean theorem]] applies specifically to **right triangles** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. If two sides of a right triangle are known, the theorem allows you to calculate the length of the third side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

The theorem is stated as:
`A² + B² = C²` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>

Where:
*   **A** and **B** represent the lengths of the two shorter sides of the right triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   **C** represents the length of the **hypotenuse** (the longest side) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

## Key Terminology

*   **Right Triangle**: A triangle that contains one angle measuring 90 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
    *   A 90-degree angle is also referred to as a **right angle** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
    *   In diagrams, a right angle is indicated by drawing a small square box at the vertex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **Hypotenuse**: The longest side of a right triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
    *   It is always the side located directly opposite the 90-degree (right) angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## Applying the Pythagorean Theorem

When [[applying_the_pythagorean_theorem | applying the Pythagorean Theorem]], the first step is always to identify the hypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

### Example: Finding the Hypotenuse (C)

Consider a right triangle with sides of length 3 and 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. The unknown side is the hypotenuse, 'C' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

1.  **Set up the equation**: A² + B² = C²
    *   4² + 3² = C² <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>
2.  **Calculate the squares**:
    *   16 (from 4 * 4) + 9 (from 3 * 3) = C² <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>
3.  **Sum the values**:
    *   25 = C² <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>
4.  **Solve for C**: Take the positive square root of both sides (since distance cannot be negative) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
    *   C = 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>
    Therefore, the length of the hypotenuse is 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

### Example: Finding a Shorter Side (A or B)

Consider a right triangle where the hypotenuse is 12 and one of the shorter sides is 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. The unknown side is one of the shorter sides, let's call it 'B' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

1.  **Identify values for A, B, C**:
    *   C = 12 (hypotenuse) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>
    *   A = 6 (one shorter side) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>
    *   B = ? (the unknown shorter side) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>
2.  **Set up the equation**: A² + B² = C²
    *   6² + B² = 12² <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>
3.  **Calculate the squares**:
    *   36 + B² = 144 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>
4.  **Isolate B²**: Subtract 36 from both sides.
    *   B² = 144 - 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>
    *   B² = 108 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>
5.  **Solve for B**: Take the principal (positive) root of both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
    *   B = √108 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>
6.  **Simplify the radical** (if possible):
    *   Find prime factorization of 108: 2 * 54 = 2 * 2 * 27 = 2 * 2 * 3 * 9 = 2 * 2 * 3 * 3 * 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>
    *   B = √(2 * 2 * 3 * 3 * 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>
    *   B = √(4 * 9 * 3) = √36 * √3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>
    *   B = 6√3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>

The length of the unknown side B is 6√3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

[[understanding_chemical_equations | Balancing chemical equations]] is a fundamental concept taught in first-year chemistry that describes [[chemical_reactions_and_equations | chemical reactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. While seemingly straightforward, it can be challenging due to its "art" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## What is a Chemical Equation?
A [[chemical_reactions_and_equations | chemical equation]] is a symbolic representation that describes a [[chemical_reactions | chemical reaction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. It illustrates the transformation of substances, showing what reacts and what is produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

### Components of a Chemical Equation
*   **Reactants**: These are the initial substances that react together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. They are typically shown on the left side of the equation.
*   **Products**: These are the new substances formed as a result of the reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. They are typically shown on the right side of the equation.

For example, in the reaction of aluminum with oxygen gas to form aluminum oxide:
> Aluminum + Oxygen Gas → Aluminum Oxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>

Here, aluminum and oxygen gas are the reactants, and aluminum oxide is the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## The Importance of [[balancing_chemical_equations | Balancing Chemical Equations]]
A fundamental principle in chemistry is the law of conservation of mass, which states that matter cannot be created or destroyed. This means that in a [[chemical_reactions | chemical reaction]], the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both the reactant and product sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

An unbalanced equation, such as:
> Al + O₂ → Al₂O₃ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>

Presents a problem:
*   **Aluminum**: One atom on the reactant side, two atoms on the product side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Oxygen**: Two atoms on the reactant side, three atoms on the product side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

[[the_process_and_importance_of_balancing_chemical_equations | Balancing chemical equations]] involves adjusting the number of molecules (or formula units) of each substance so that the atom count for every element is equal on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### Key Rules for [[the_process_and_importance_of_balancing_chemical_equations | Balancing Chemical Equations]]
1.  **Do Not Change Molecular Ratios**: You cannot alter the subscripts within a chemical formula (e.g., Al₂O₃ must remain Al₂O₃). This would change the chemical identity of the substance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
2.  **Use Coefficients**: Only adjust the whole number coefficients in front of the chemical formulas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This changes the number of molecules involved in the reaction.
3.  **[[whole_number_convention_in_chemical_equations | Whole Number Convention]]**: Coefficients must always be [[whole_number_convention_in_chemical_equations | whole numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. If fractions are used during the balancing process, multiply the entire equation by the smallest whole number to eliminate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## [[detailed_examples_of_balancing_chemical_equations | Detailed Examples of Balancing Chemical Equations]]

### Example 1: Aluminum and Oxygen
Initial unbalanced equation:
> Al + O₂ → Al₂O₃ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>

1.  **Balance Aluminum (Al)**:
    *   Reactants: 1 Al <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
    *   Products: 2 Al <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>
    *   Add a coefficient of 2 in front of Al on the reactant side:
        > 2Al + O₂ → Al₂O₃ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>
    *   Now, both sides have 2 Al atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

2.  **Balance Oxygen (O)**:
    *   Reactants: 2 O (from O₂) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>
    *   Products: 3 O (from Al₂O₃) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>
    *   To find a common multiple for 2 and 3, we can consider 6. To get 3 oxygen atoms on the right to 6, you'd multiply the Al₂O₃ by 2. This would change the Aluminum, so let's aim for 3 on the right using a fraction first, to illustrate the rule.
    *   Multiply O₂ by 1.5 to get 3 oxygen atoms (1.5 * 2 = 3):
        > 2Al + 1.5O₂ → Al₂O₃ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>
    *   Now, both sides have 2 Al and 3 O <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

3.  **Eliminate Fractions**:
    *   Since fractions of atoms or molecules are not allowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, multiply the entire equation by 2 to remove the 1.5 coefficient:
        > (2Al + 1.5O₂ → Al₂O₃) * 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>
        > 4Al + 3O₂ → 2Al₂O₃ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>

4.  **Final Check**:
    *   Al: 4 on left, 4 on right (2 * 2 = 4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>
    *   O: 6 on left (3 * 2 = 6), 6 on right (2 * 3 = 6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>
    *   The equation is balanced.

### Example 2: Methane Combustion
Initial unbalanced equation:
> C₂H₄ (g) + O₂ (g) → CO₂ (g) + H₂O (l) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>

Strategy: Balance complicated molecules first, then single-atom molecules (like O₂) last, as they are easier to adjust without affecting other elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

1.  **Balance Carbon (C)**:
    *   Reactants: 2 C (from C₂H₄) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>
    *   Products: 1 C (from CO₂) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>
    *   Add a coefficient of 2 in front of CO₂:
        > C₂H₄ + O₂ → 2CO₂ + H₂O <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>
    *   Now, both sides have 2 C atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

2.  **Balance Hydrogen (H)**:
    *   Reactants: 4 H (from C₂H₄) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>
    *   Products: 2 H (from H₂O) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>
    *   Add a coefficient of 2 in front of H₂O:
        > C₂H₄ + O₂ → 2CO₂ + 2H₂O <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>
    *   Now, both sides have 4 H atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

3.  **Balance Oxygen (O)**:
    *   Reactants: 2 O (from O₂) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>
    *   Products: 4 O (from 2CO₂) + 2 O (from 2H₂O) = 6 O <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>
    *   Add a coefficient of 3 in front of O₂ on the reactant side (3 * 2 = 6):
        > C₂H₄ + 3O₂ → 2CO₂ + 2H₂O <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>

4.  **Final Check**:
    *   C: 2 on left, 2 on right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>
    *   H: 4 on left, 4 on right (2 * 2 = 4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>
    *   O: 6 on left (3 * 2 = 6), 6 on right (2 * 2 + 2 * 1 = 4 + 2 = 6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>
    *   The equation is balanced.

### Example 3: Ethane Combustion (with fraction handling)
Initial unbalanced equation:
> C₂H₆ + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>

1.  **Balance Carbon (C)**:
    *   Reactants: 2 C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>
    *   Products: 1 C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>
    *   Add a coefficient of 2 in front of CO₂:
        > C₂H₆ + O₂ → 2CO₂ + H₂O <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>

2.  **Balance Hydrogen (H)**:
    *   Reactants: 6 H <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>
    *   Products: 2 H <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>
    *   Add a coefficient of 3 in front of H₂O:
        > C₂H₆ + O₂ → 2CO₂ + 3H₂O <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>
    *   Now, both sides have 6 H atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

3.  **Balance Oxygen (O)**:
    *   Reactants: 2 O (from O₂) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>
    *   Products: (2 * 2) O (from 2CO₂) + (3 * 1) O (from 3H₂O) = 4 + 3 = 7 O <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>
    *   To get 7 O on the left from O₂, we need 3.5 O₂ molecules (3.5 * 2 = 7):
        > C₂H₆ + 3.5O₂ → 2CO₂ + 3H₂O <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>

4.  **Eliminate Fractions**:
    *   Multiply the entire equation by 2 to remove the 3.5 coefficient:
        > (C₂H₆ + 3.5O₂ → 2CO₂ + 3H₂O) * 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>
        > 2C₂H₆ + 7O₂ → 4CO₂ + 6H₂O <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>

5.  **Final Check**:
    *   C: 4 on left (2 * 2 = 4), 4 on right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>
    *   H: 12 on left (2 * 6 = 12), 12 on right (6 * 2 = 12) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>
    *   O: 14 on left (7 * 2 = 14), 14 on right (4 * 2 + 6 * 1 = 8 + 6 = 14) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>
    *   The equation is balanced.

### Example 4: Iron Oxide and Sulfuric Acid (Grouping Polyatomic Ions)
Initial unbalanced equation:
> Fe₂O₃ + H₂SO₄ → Fe₂(SO₄)₃ + H₂O <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>

Strategy: When a polyatomic ion (like sulfate, SO₄) remains intact on both sides of the equation, treat it as a single unit or "atom" for balancing purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
Let X = SO₄ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
Rewritten equation:

1.  **Balance Iron (Fe)**:

    *   Iron is already balanced.

2.  **Balance Oxygen (O) (not part of the polyatomic ion)**:

    *   Products: 1 O (from H₂O) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>
    *   Add a coefficient of 3 in front of H₂O:
        > Fe₂O₃ + H₂X → Fe₂X₃ + 3H₂O <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>

    *   Add a coefficient of 3 in front of H₂X:
        > Fe₂O₃ + 3H₂X → Fe₂X₃ + 3H₂O <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>

4.  **Balance the Polyatomic Ion (X)**:
    *   Reactants: 3 X (from 3H₂X) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>

    *   The X (SO₄) group is now balanced.

5.  **Re-substitute X (SO₄)**:
    > Fe₂O₃ + 3H₂SO₄ → Fe₂(SO₄)₃ + 3H₂O <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>

6.  **Final Check**:
    *   Fe: 2 on left, 2 on right.
    *   O (not in SO₄): 3 on left, 3 on right.
    *   H: 6 on left (3 * 2 = 6), 6 on right (3 * 2 = 6).
    *   SO₄: 3 on left, 3 on right.
    *   The equation is balanced.

From: [[khanacademy]] <br/> 

[[NAD reduction to NADH during glycolysis | NADH]] and FADH2 are crucial molecules produced during cellular respiration, particularly from [[glycolysis_and_its_role_in_cellular_respiration | glycolysis]], pyruvate oxidation, and the Krebs cycle. While [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]] is the direct energy currency, [[NAD reduction to NADH during glycolysis | NADH]] and FADH2 serve as vital inputs for the electron transport chain, where the bulk of [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]] is generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

## Production of NADH and FADH2

These electron carrier molecules are generated in various stages of glucose catabolism:

*   **Glycolysis**: The process of [[glycolysis_and_its_role_in_cellular_respiration | glycolysis]], which splits a glucose molecule, produces a net of two [[role_of_atp_in_glycolysis | ATPs]] and two [[role_of_nad_and_nadh_in_glycolysis | NADHs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. [[glycolysis_and_its_role_in_cellular_respiration | Glycolysis]] occurs in the cytoplasm and does not require oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   **Pyruvate Oxidation (Preparatory Stage)**: Before entering the Krebs cycle, each pyruvate molecule undergoes oxidation, producing one [[NAD reduction to NADH during glycolysis | NADH]] per pyruvate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Since two pyruvates are produced from one glucose molecule, this stage yields two [[NAD reduction to NADH during glycolysis | NADHs]] per glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
*   **Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle)**: The Krebs cycle itself produces [[NAD reduction to NADH during glycolysis | NADHs]] and FADH2s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. For each turn of the cycle (per pyruvate), three [[NAD reduction to NADH during glycolysis | NADHs]] and one FADH2 are generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. Since the cycle runs twice for every glucose molecule, a total of six [[NAD reduction to NADH during glycolysis | NADHs]] and two FADH2s are produced from the Krebs cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

## Role in the Electron Transport Chain

The primary function of [[NAD reduction to NADH during glycolysis | NADH]] and FADH2 is to deliver high-energy electrons to the electron transport chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. In this final stage of cellular respiration, these molecules are oxidized, losing their hydrogens (and associated electrons) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. This process is where the majority of [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATP]] is produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

### ATP Yield from Electron Carriers

For every molecule of glucose, the cumulative production of these electron carriers is:
*   **10 [[NAD reduction to NADH during glycolysis | NADHs]]**: Two from [[functional_steps_and_enzymes_involved_in_glycolysis | glycolysis]], two from pyruvate oxidation, and six from the Krebs cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.
*   **2 FADH2s**: Both from the Krebs cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

When these molecules enter the electron transport chain:
*   Each [[NAD reduction to NADH during glycolysis | NADH]] is estimated to produce three [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATPs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. Therefore, 10 [[NAD reduction to NADH during glycolysis | NADHs]] yield 30 [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATPs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
*   Each FADH2 is estimated to produce two [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATPs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. Therefore, 2 FADH2s yield 4 [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATPs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

These 34 [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATPs]] from the electron transport chain, combined with the 4 [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATPs]] directly produced from [[glycolysis_and_its_role_in_cellular_respiration | glycolysis]] (2 net) and the Krebs cycle (2), contribute to a theoretical maximum of 38 [[role_of_atp_in_cellular_respiration | ATPs]] per glucose molecule in a super-efficient cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

[[understanding_basic_multiplication|Multiplication]] is a mathematical operation that can be understood as a simplified way of performing [[introduction_to_basic_addition|addition]] repeatedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Multiplication as Repeated Addition

Consider the expression "2 times 3" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Unlike [[introduction_to_basic_addition|addition]] where 2 plus 3 equals 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, [[understanding_basic_multiplication|multiplication]] involves adding a number to itself multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

There are two common ways to interpret "2 times 3":

1.  **Adding 2 to itself three times**: This means 2 + 2 + 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. The number 3 indicates how many times the number 2 is added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
    2 + 2 = 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>
    4 + 2 = 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>
    Therefore, 2 times 3 equals 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

2.  **Adding 3 to itself two times**: This means 3 + 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. In this case, the number 2 indicates how many times the number 3 is added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
    3 + 3 = 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>

Both interpretations yield the same result of 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. This concept, where the order of the numbers in [[understanding_basic_multiplication|multiplication]] does not change the result, is a fundamental [[multiplication_properties_and_concepts|property of multiplication]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. For example, "four 3's" (3 + 3 + 3 + 3) equals 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>, just as "three 4's" (4 + 4 + 4) also equals 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

## Efficiency in Counting

[[understanding_basic_multiplication|Multiplication]] is particularly useful for [[using_multiplication_for_efficient_counting|efficiently counting]] large groups of items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. For instance, to count lemons arranged in rows:
If there are 3 lemons in each row and 4 rows of lemons, the total number of lemons can be found by [[understanding_basic_multiplication|multiplying]] 4 times 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

4 times 3 = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>

While it might initially seem faster to count each item individually, [[understanding_basic_multiplication|multiplication]] becomes invaluable when dealing with much larger numbers, such as 100 lemons in 100 rows, where direct counting would be impractical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

## Special Cases: Multiplication by 1 and 0

### Multiplying by 1

When a number is [[understanding_basic_multiplication|multiplied]] by 1, the result is the original number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
For example, 3 times 1 means "three 1's" (1 + 1 + 1), which equals 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.
Alternatively, it can be seen as "3 one time," which is simply 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

*   3 times 1 = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>
*   1 times 3 = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>
*   100 times 1 = 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>
*   1 times 39 = 39 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>

### Multiplying by 0

When a number is [[understanding_basic_multiplication|multiplied]] by 0, the result is always 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.
For example, 4 times 0 can be interpreted as "0 four times" (0 + 0 + 0 + 0), which equals 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.
It can also be thought of as "4 zero times," meaning there are no 4s at all, resulting in nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

*   5,493,692 times 0 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>
*   0 times 17 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>

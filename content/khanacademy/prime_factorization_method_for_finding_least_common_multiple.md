From: [[khanacademy]] <br/> 

The [[least_common_multiple | least common multiple]] (LCM) of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. For example, the LCM of 36 and 12 is 36, because 36 is a multiple of 12 (12 x 3 = 36) and also a multiple of 36 (36 x 1 = 36) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Using Prime Factorization to Find the LCM

One systematic way to find the [[least_common_multiple | least common multiple]] is through the [[Prime factorization method for finding least common multiple | prime factorization approach]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This method involves:
1.  Taking the prime factorization of each number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
2.  Constructing the smallest number whose prime factorization includes all the prime factors (with their highest powers) present in either of the original numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### Example: Finding the LCM of 18 and 12

Let's find the [[least_common_multiple | least common multiple]] of 18 and 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

#### Step 1: Prime Factorization of 18
*   18 can be broken down as 2 times 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   9 can be broken down as 3 times 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   So, the prime factorization of 18 is 2 × 3 × 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

#### Step 2: Prime Factorization of 12
*   12 can be broken down as 2 times 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   6 can be broken down as 2 times 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   So, the prime factorization of 12 is 2 × 2 × 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

#### Step 3: Construct the Least Common Multiple
The [[least_common_multiple | LCM]] must contain all the prime factors required by both 18 and 12, but no more than necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

1.  **For 18 (2 × 3 × 3):** The LCM must include one 2 and two 3s (3 × 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
2.  **For 12 (2 × 2 × 3):**
    *   The LCM already has one 3, so no additional 3 is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
    *   The LCM already has one 2, but 12 requires two 2s. Therefore, one additional 2 is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

So, the prime factors for the LCM are 2 (from 18) × 3 (from 18) × 3 (from 18) × 2 (additional 2 for 12) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

LCM (18, 12) = 2 × 3 × 3 × 2 = 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Comparison to Other Methods

While the [[brute_force_method_for_finding_least_common_multiple | brute force method]] (listing multiples) also works, the [[Prime factorization method for finding least common multiple | prime factorization method]] is more systematic and efficient, especially when dealing with very large numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. It allows for a clearer understanding of how the [[least_common_multiple | LCM]] is constructed from the prime components of the numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

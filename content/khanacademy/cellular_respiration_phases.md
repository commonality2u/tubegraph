[[introduction_to_cellular_respiration|Cellular respiration]] is broadly divided into three main phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>:

1.  **[[glycolysis_process|Glycolysis]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>
2.  **[[krebs_cycle|Krebs Cycle]]** (also known as the citric acid cycle) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>
3.  **Electron Transport Chain** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>

The presence or absence of [[role_of_oxygen_in_cellular_respiration|oxygen]] dictates the pathway after [[glycolysis_process|glycolysis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>:
*   **Without [[role_of_oxygen_in_cellular_respiration|oxygen]]:** The process moves to fermentation, which in humans produces lactic acid, and in other organisms, may produce alcohol or ethanol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   **With [[role_of_oxygen_in_cellular_respiration|oxygen]]:** The process continues to the [[krebs_cycle|Krebs cycle]] and then the electron transport chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The electron transport chain is where the bulk of ATP is produced, utilizing raw materials from the earlier phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Glycolysis

[[glycolysis_process|Glycolysis]] literally means "the breaking down of glucose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This process starts with glucose, which has the chemical formula C6H12O6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Glucose is a six-carbon molecule, often drawn as a ring or as six carbons in a row <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

[[glycolysis_process|Glycolysis]] is divided into two important [[investment_and_payoff_phases_of_glycolysis|phases]]: the investment phase and the payoff phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

### Investment Phase

The investment phase requires an input of [[energy production through cellular respiration|energy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>:
*   **ATP Consumption:** Two ATP molecules are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. This means that although the purpose of [[cellular respiration]] is to generate ATP, the initial step of [[glycolysis_process|glycolysis]] actually consumes it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Glucose Breakdown:** The glucose molecule is broken down into two 3-carbon compounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. These compounds, also known as PGAL (phosphoglyceraldehyde or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate), have a phosphate group attached to them, derived from the consumed ATPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

### Payoff Phase

The payoff phase follows the investment phase, with each of the two PGAL molecules proceeding independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>:
*   **Pyruvate Production:** Each PGAL molecule is transformed into pyruvate (or pyruvic acid), which is another 3-carbon compound but reconfigured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Pyruvate is the end product of [[glycolysis_process|glycolysis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. For every molecule of glucose, two molecules of pyruvate are produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   **ATP Generation:** Each PGAL produces two ATPs during this phase, resulting in a total of four ATPs from the initial glucose molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **NADH Generation:** Each PGAL also produces one NADH molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. NADH is formed when NAD+ is reduced by gaining a hydrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. These NADH molecules will later be used in the electron transport chain to produce more ATPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

### Overall Summary of Glycolysis

The net output of [[glycolysis_process|glycolysis]] from one glucose molecule is summarized as follows:

*   **Inputs:**
    *   1 Glucose molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>
    *   2 NAD+ molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>
    *   2 ATP molecules (consumed in the investment phase) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>
    *   4 ADP molecules and 4 phosphate groups (to produce 4 ATPs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>

*   **Outputs:**
    *   2 Pyruvate molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>
    *   2 NADH molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>
    *   **Net of 2 ATPs** (4 produced minus 2 used) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>
    *   2 ADP molecules (from the used ATPs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>

The two NADHs produced can later contribute to [[energy efficiency and ATP yield of cellular respiration|energy production through cellular respiration]] in the electron transport chain, each yielding approximately three ATPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. The two pyruvate molecules are then re-engineered into acetyl-CoAs, which serve as raw materials for the [[krebs_cycle|Krebs cycle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

### Glycolysis Mechanism

The detailed mechanism shows glucose, a six-carbon ring, undergoing several steps. In the investment phase, one ATP is used to modify the glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. The molecule then splits into two 3-carbon compounds (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate or PGAL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

In the payoff phase, for each glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate molecule:
*   Two ATPs are produced as it transforms into pyruvate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.
*   One NAD+ is reduced to NADH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

The final product, pyruvate, is a 3-carbon structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. During [[glycolysis_process|glycolysis]], the glucose molecule is split in half and undergoes oxidation, losing some hydrogens and having its carbons bond more strongly with [[role_of_oxygen_in_cellular_respiration|oxygen]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

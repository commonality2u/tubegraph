## The Universal Language of Mathematics

Galileo Galilei asserted that "Philosophy is written in that great book which ever lies before our eyes-- I mean the universe-- but we cannot understand it if we do not first learn the language and grasp the symbols in which is written" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. He further stated that this book is written in the "mathematical language, without which one wanders in vain through a dark labyrinth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. This perspective highlights the core purpose of [[introduction_to_algebra | algebra]] and mathematics: to abstract fundamental ideas that reveal the structure of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. These foundational concepts are applicable across diverse domains, including economics, finance, physics, and chemistry, underscoring their pure and fundamental nature beyond specific applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.

## From Concrete Examples to Abstract Equations

To illustrate the process of abstraction, consider a common scenario: calculating a discount at a store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

### Specific Calculation

For a $20 pair of pants with a 30% discount, the calculation is straightforward: `Discount = 30% * $20` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. In decimal form, this is `0.30 * $20`, resulting in a $6 discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.

### Generalizing the Product Price

The first step in abstraction involves using a variable to represent any product price. If `x` denotes the non-discounted price of any item, the discount can be expressed as `Discount = 30% * x` or `Discount = 0.30 * x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>. This allows for [[using_substitution_to_verify_algebraic_solutions | substitution]]; for example, a $10 product would yield a $3 discount (`0.30 * 10 = 3`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>. This represents an initial step into the abstraction of [[introduction_to_algebra | algebra]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.

### Generalizing Both Percentage and Product

The abstraction can be further extended by using a variable for the percentage off. Let `p` represent the percentage off, and `x` remain the product price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>. The general formula for the discount becomes `Discount = p * x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.

We can introduce another variable, `y`, to represent the discount itself. This results in the general [[understanding_equality_in_algebra | equation]]: `y = p * x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>. The choice of letters or symbols for these variables is arbitrary, as long as their representation is consistently tracked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.

## Cross-Domain Applications of Abstract Equations

This abstract relationship, `y = p * x`, is not limited to retail discounts. It can be applied to vastly different fields. For instance, in physics, the formula for force is `Force = Mass * Acceleration` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>. While the labels differ, the underlying mathematical structure is identical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>. One could equate `y` to force, `p` to mass, and `x` to acceleration, demonstrating the same fundamental relationship across domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>.

This single equation, `y = p * x`, possesses an infinite number of applications across economics, finance, computer science, logic, electrical engineering, and accounting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>.

## Manipulating Abstractions to Discover Truths

The power of [[introduction_to_algebra | algebra]] lies in its ability to focus on and manipulate these abstractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>. Discoveries made through manipulating these abstract ideas can then be universally reapplied to all their specific applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>. This process unveils the underlying structure of the universe, stripped of specific human definitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>.

For example, starting with `y = p * x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>, if we want to determine what `y` divided by `x` equals, we perform the same operation on both sides of the [[understanding_equality_in_algebra | equation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>.

`y / x = (p * x) / x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>

Since multiplying by `x` and then dividing by `x` cancels out, the `x` terms on the right side are eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>. This leaves us with the manipulated abstract relationship:

`y / x = p` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>

This newly derived relationship has implications for every application of the original equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>. Algebra allows us to discover fundamental truths about the universe, largely independent of specific applications, which can then be reapplied to countless existing and yet-to-be-discovered scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>.

This demonstrates why mathematics is considered the language for understanding the universe's philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:00">[09:45:00]</a>. It is often posited that if alien life forms were to contact humans, mathematics would likely serve as their first common ground for communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>.

[[introduction_to_trigonometry | Trigonometry]] is the study of right triangles and the relationships between their sides and angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This article demonstrates how to calculate the [[basic_trigonometric_functions_sine_cosine_and_tangent | basic trigonometric functions]]—sine, cosine, and tangent—using a right triangle example. These calculations reveal the ratios of a triangle's sides relative to a specific angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## The SOHCAHTOA Mnemonic

A helpful mnemonic for remembering the definitions of sine, cosine, and tangent is [[sohcahtoa_mnemonic_for_trigonometric_functions | SOHCAHTOA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>:

*   **SOH**: **S**ine = **O**pposite / **H**ypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>
*   **CAH**: **C**osine = **A**djacent / **H**ypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>
*   **TOA**: **T**angent = **O**pposite / **A**djacent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>

## Example Right Triangle

Consider a right triangle with sides of length 3, 4, and a hypotenuse of 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Let's label one of the acute angles as theta (θ) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

```
       /|
      / |
     /  | 4 (Opposite to θ)
    /   |
   /θ___|
  3 (Adjacent to θ)
```

In this triangle:
*   The side opposite angle θ is 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   The side adjacent to angle θ is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
*   The hypotenuse (the longest side, opposite the right angle) is 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

## Calculating Trigonometric Functions for Angle Theta (θ)

### Sine of Theta (sin θ)

Using SOH (Sine = Opposite / Hypotenuse):
*   Opposite side = 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>
*   Hypotenuse = 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>

Therefore, sin(θ) = 4 / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

### Cosine of Theta (cos θ)

Using CAH (Cosine = Adjacent / Hypotenuse):
*   Adjacent side = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>
*   Hypotenuse = 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>

Therefore, cos(θ) = 3 / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

### Tangent of Theta (tan θ)

Using TOA (Tangent = Opposite / Adjacent):
*   Opposite side = 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>
*   Adjacent side = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>

Therefore, tan(θ) = 4 / 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

## Calculating Trigonometric Functions for Another Angle (x)

The choice of angle is critical when [[applying_trigonometry_to_different_angles_in_a_triangle | applying trigonometry to different angles in a triangle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Let's consider the other acute angle in the same triangle, labeled 'x':

```
       /|
      / | 3 (Opposite to x)
     /  |
    / x |
   /____|
  4 (Adjacent to x)
```

In this case:
*   The side opposite angle x is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
*   The side adjacent to angle x is 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
*   The hypotenuse remains 5.

### Tangent of X (tan x)

Using TOA (Tangent = Opposite / Adjacent):
*   Opposite side = 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>
*   Adjacent side = 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>

Therefore, tan(x) = 3 / 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

This demonstrates that the tangent of angle x is the inverse of the tangent of angle theta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

The ability to calculate these ratios allows for determining unknown angles from side lengths, or unknown side lengths from an angle and one side, often with the aid of a calculator or trigonometric tables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

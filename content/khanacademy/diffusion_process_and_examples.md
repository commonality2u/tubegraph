This article covers topics related to [[diffusion_basics | diffusion]], which, while seemingly simple, can often be confusing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Core Concepts

### Solvent, Solute, and Solution

Imagine a container filled with water molecules, representing liquid water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Within this water, there are also sugar molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. In this scenario, there are significantly more water molecules than sugar molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

*   **Solvent**: The substance that there is more of in a mixture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. In this example, water is the solvent because it has more molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The solvent is the substance that does the dissolving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Water is a very common solvent in biological and chemical systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
*   **Solute**: The substance that there is less of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. In this case, sugar is the solute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. It is the substance that is dissolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Solution**: The combination of the solvent and the solute molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. The sugar is said to be "dissolved" into the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Understanding Diffusion

[[diffusion_basics | Diffusion]] is the process where particles or molecules spread out from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. This occurs due to the random movement and bumping of molecules that possess kinetic energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

### How Diffusion Works

Consider a container with gaseous oxygen molecules initially concentrated in one area, with the rest of the container being a vacuum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. These molecules move randomly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Over time, due to the probability of moving into unoccupied space, the molecules will spread out to fill the entire container, reaching a state of equilibrium where they are relatively spread out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

### Concentration

**Concentration** measures how much of a particle you have per unit space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   A **high concentration** means there are many particles per unit space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
*   A **low concentration** means there are very few particles per unit space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

### Diffusion in Solutions

In a solution, if you have a higher concentration of solute in one area connected to an area of lower concentration (e.g., sugar dissolved only on one side of a container with a connecting pipe), the solute molecules will eventually spread out to make their concentrations roughly equal across both areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. This happens because individual molecules are more likely to move from where they are crowded to where they are less crowded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. This process of spreading from high to low concentration is diffusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

## Related Terminology

### Hypertonic and Hypotonic Solutions

When discussing solutions in the context of diffusion, specific terms are used to describe their relative concentrations:

*   **Hypertonic solution**: A solution with a higher concentration of solute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. The prefix "hyper-" implies having a lot or too much of something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
*   **Hypotonic solution**: A solution with a lower concentration of solute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. The prefix "hypo-" implies not enough or a low amount (e.g., hypoglycemic means low sugar in the bloodstream) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

In general, without barriers, solutes will diffuse from a hypertonic solution to a hypotonic solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

## Diffusion vs. Osmosis

While [[diffusion_basics | diffusion]] refers to any particle spreading from high to low concentration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>, [[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | osmosis]] is a specific type of diffusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.

[[osmosis_and_semipermeable_membranes | Osmosis]] is the diffusion of water (the solvent) through a semi-permeable membrane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. A **semi-permeable membrane** allows water molecules to pass through but blocks larger solute molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. In this scenario, water will flow from an area where its concentration is effectively higher (a hypotonic solute solution) to an area where its concentration is effectively lower (a hypertonic solute solution) in an attempt to equalize the solute concentrations on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. This movement is also driven by probabilities, as water molecules are less likely to be "blocked" from entering the side with more solute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.

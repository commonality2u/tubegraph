Welcome to the introduction to grammar on Khan Academy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## What is Grammar?
Grammar is defined as a set of [[difference_between_conventions_and_rules_in_grammar | conventions and rules]] that govern language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

### Rules vs. Conventions
The distinction between a rule and a convention is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>:
*   A **rule** is the fundamental minimum required for language to be understandable by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. For example, for a car to move as intended, its wheels must be on the bottom, not the roof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   A **convention** is a shared agreement that is not strictly necessary for functionality, such as the idea that all cars should be painted teal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Grammar is Context Dependent
Grammar is also [[context_dependency_of_grammar | context dependent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The type of grammar used varies throughout the day based on who is being spoken to, what is being communicated, and how it is being expressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. People utilize multiple forms of grammar in their daily lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Preexisting Grammar Knowledge
Everyone already possesses significant [[preexisting_grammar_knowledge | grammar knowledge]] simply from living and interacting in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. If you can understand spoken English, you already know a great deal about grammar, including how to construct sentences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. The purpose of these videos is to provide formal names to the linguistic concepts you already intuitively understand, thereby enhancing your command of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Focus of the Videos
This video series focuses exclusively on **Standard American English** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. It is important to note that many different "Englishes" exist, all of which are valid, vibrant, and important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. The goal is not to dictate what is "right" or "wrong" in language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Instead, the aim is to equip you with the tools to master and utilize English in any way you choose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. The focus is on ensuring the fundamental structure is sound, like making sure a car's wheels are on straight, regardless of its "color" or stylistic choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

You are considered a grammarian, having studied grammar throughout your entire speaking and reading life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. You can learn anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

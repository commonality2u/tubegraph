Grammar refers to the collection of conventions and rules that govern language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Rules vs. Conventions

*   **Rules** are the fundamental requirements for making language understandable to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. For example, for a car to move forward as intended, its wheels must be on the bottom, not the roof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Conventions** are practices or agreements that are not strictly necessary for understanding but are widely adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. An example of a convention would be if all cars were expected to be painted teal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Characteristics of Grammar

### Context-Dependent

Grammar is [[contextdependent_grammar | context dependent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The type of grammar used varies throughout the day depending on who is being spoken to, what is being conveyed, and how it is being communicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This means people utilize multiple kinds of grammar in their daily lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### Existing Knowledge

Individuals already possess a significant amount of grammar knowledge simply by existing in the world and interacting with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The ability to understand a speaker demonstrates a deep existing knowledge of grammar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### Purpose of Study

The purpose of grammar videos is to assign names to the concepts that individuals already instinctively know, thereby providing greater command over them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### Focus and Inclusivity

These particular videos primarily focus on "standard American English" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. However, it's important to recognize that many "Englishes" exist, and all are considered great, wonderful, vibrant, important, and special <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. The aim is not to dictate what is "right" or "wrong" in language; if one's English differs from the standard, that is perfectly acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. The goal is to equip learners with tools to harness English and use it in any way they desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

Ultimately, everyone is considered a grammarian who has made a study of grammar throughout their entire speaking and reading life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

When working with fractions, finding common factors is a crucial step for simplifying expressions to their lowest terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. A common factor is a number that divides evenly into two or more numbers.

## Identifying Common Factors

In the multiplication of fractions, such as 5/6 times 2/3, the resulting fraction might not be in its simplest form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. For example, 5/6 multiplied by 2/3 yields 10/18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Observing the numerator (10) and the denominator (18), it becomes apparent that they share common factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. In this case, both 10 and 18 are divisible by 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Simplifying Fractions

There are two primary methods for simplifying fractions using common factors:

### 1. Simplifying After Multiplication

After performing the multiplication, divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common factor to reduce the fraction to its lowest terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

For the example of 10/18:
*   Divide the numerator (10) by 2: 10 ÷ 2 = 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   Divide the denominator (18) by 2: 18 ÷ 2 = 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
The simplified answer is 5/9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

### 2. Simplifying Before Multiplication

Simplifying can also be done before the actual multiplication takes place, which can make the numbers smaller and easier to work with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This involves identifying common factors between any numerator and any denominator in the multiplication problem.

Consider 5/6 multiplied by 2/3:
1.  Observe the numerator 2 and the denominator 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Both are divisible by 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
2.  Divide the numerator 2 by 2, which results in 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
3.  Divide the denominator 6 by 2, which results in 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
4.  The expression effectively becomes 5/3 multiplied by 1/3.
5.  Multiply the new numerators (5 × 1 = 5) and the new denominators (3 × 3 = 9) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
The result is 5/9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

This method is essentially [[factoring numerators and denominators | factoring numerators and denominators]] and canceling out common terms before multiplying.

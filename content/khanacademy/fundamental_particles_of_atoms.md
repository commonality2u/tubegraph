For thousands of years, humans have observed that different [[properties_of_substances|substances]] in the environment have varying [[properties_of_substances|properties]] and react differently with each other under certain circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This observation led to the question of whether there is a smallest, indivisible unit of any given [[elements_and_the_periodic_table|substance]] that still retains its [[properties_of_substances|properties]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## The Atom

The smallest unit of a pure [[elements_and_the_periodic_table|substance]] that maintains its specific [[properties_of_substances|properties]] (like carbon, lead, or gold) is called an [[elements_and_the_periodic_table|element]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. All known [[elements_and_the_periodic_table|elements]] are listed in the [[periodic_table_of_elements|Periodic Table of Elements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

The most basic unit of any of these [[elements_and_the_periodic_table|elements]] is the [[atoms_as_the_smallest_unit_of_elements|atom]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. If you continue to break down an [[elements_and_the_periodic_table|element]] into smaller and smaller chunks, you eventually reach an [[atoms_as_the_smallest_unit_of_elements|atom]] of that [[elements_and_the_periodic_table|element]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Breaking an [[atoms_as_the_smallest_unit_of_elements|atom]] down further would cause it to lose the [[properties_of_substances|properties]] of its original [[elements_and_the_periodic_table|element]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

Atoms are unimaginably small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. For example, a single human hair is approximately one million carbon [[atoms_as_the_smallest_unit_of_elements|atoms]] wide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

## Components of an Atom

While the [[atoms_as_the_smallest_unit_of_elements|atom]] is the most basic building block of an [[elements_and_the_periodic_table|element]], it is itself composed of even more fundamental particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. The type and arrangement of these fundamental particles define the [[properties_of_substances|properties]] of the [[elements_and_the_periodic_table|element]] and how it will react <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Changing the number of these particles can change the [[properties_of_substances|properties]] or even the [[elements_and_the_periodic_table|element]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

The three primary fundamental particles within an [[atoms_as_the_smallest_unit_of_elements|atom]] are:

### Protons
*   **Location**: Protons are located in the center of the [[atoms_as_the_smallest_unit_of_elements|atom]], forming the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **Charge**: Protons carry a positive charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
*   **Defining Characteristic**: The number of protons in an [[atoms_as_the_smallest_unit_of_elements|atom]]'s nucleus is what defines the [[elements_and_the_periodic_table|element]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. This is known as the atomic number, which is literally the number of protons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. For example, hydrogen always has one proton, carbon always has six protons, and oxygen always has eight protons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. If an [[atoms_as_the_smallest_unit_of_elements|atom]]'s proton count changes, it becomes a different [[elements_and_the_periodic_table|element]] (e.g., adding a proton to oxygen makes it fluorine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

### Neutrons
*   **Location**: Neutrons are also found in the nucleus of the [[atoms_as_the_smallest_unit_of_elements|atom]], alongside protons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **Charge**: Neutrons are neutral, meaning they have no electrical charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
*   **Variability**: The number of neutrons in an [[atoms_as_the_smallest_unit_of_elements|atom]] can vary without changing the [[elements_and_the_periodic_table|element]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. For instance, Carbon-12 has six protons and six neutrons, while Carbon-14 still has six protons but eight neutrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. The total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus can be used to identify specific versions of an [[elements_and_the_periodic_table|element]] (e.g., Carbon-12) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

### Electrons
*   **Location**: Electrons are not located in the nucleus but rather "buzz around" or "jump around" the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. While sometimes imagined as orbiting like planets around a sun, this model is not entirely accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   **Charge**: Electrons carry a negative charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
*   **Attraction**: Due to their opposite charges, electrons are attracted to the positively charged protons in the nucleus, which keeps them bound to the [[atoms_as_the_smallest_unit_of_elements|atom]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
*   **Role in [[introduction_to_chemistry|Chemistry]]**: The number and configuration of electrons dictate much of an [[atoms_as_the_smallest_unit_of_elements|atom]]'s [[properties_of_substances|properties]] and how it engages in [[interaction_of_atoms_and_molecules|chemical reactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. Electrons can be gained or lost by an [[atoms_as_the_smallest_unit_of_elements|atom]], affecting its net electrical charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. If an [[atoms_as_the_smallest_unit_of_elements|atom]] has an equal number of protons and electrons, it is considered electrically neutral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

## The Nucleus

The **nucleus** is the dense central core of an [[atoms_as_the_smallest_unit_of_elements|atom]], composed of protons and neutrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. The number of protons in the nucleus defines the [[elements_and_the_periodic_table|element]], while the number of neutrons can vary to form different isotopes of that same [[elements_and_the_periodic_table|element]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

Understanding these fundamental particles and their [[electron_behavior_and_chemical_reactions|behavior]] is key to predicting how [[elements_and_the_periodic_table|elements]] interact and bond, forming the basis of [[introduction_to_chemistry|chemistry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

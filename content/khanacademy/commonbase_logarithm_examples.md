A [[Logarithm notation | logarithm]] is a mathematical operation that represents the [[Inverse relationship between logarithms and exponents | inverse relationship]] to exponentiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. When asked "What is a logarithm?", it's essentially asking "To what power must a specific base be raised to get a certain number?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

The word "logarithm" is often shortened to "log" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Understanding Logarithms

A logarithmic expression like `log base b of x = y` can be rewritten as an exponential equation: `b to the power of y = x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. The answer to a [[Evaluating logarithmic expressions | logarithm expression]] is the exponent to which the base must be raised to obtain the given number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Examples of Logarithms

Here are several [[Examples of logarithmic calculations | examples of common base logarithm calculations]]:

*   **Example 1: log base 2 of 8**
    *   The exponential equivalent is `2 to the what power = 8?` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>
    *   Since `2 to the third power = 8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>,
    *   `log base 2 of 8 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

*   **Example 2: log base 4 of 64**
    *   This asks `4 to what power = 64?` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>
    *   We know that `4 to the third power = 64` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
    *   Therefore, `log base 4 of 64 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

*   **Example 3: log base 10 of 1,000,000**
    *   This asks `10 to what power = 1,000,000?` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>
    *   `10 to the sixth power = 1,000,000` (1 followed by six zeros) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
    *   So, `log base 10 of 1,000,000 = 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

*   **Example 4: log base 1/2 of 1/8**
    *   This means `1/2 to the x power = 1/8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
    *   Since `1/2 to the third power = 1/8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
    *   `log base 1/2 of 1/8 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

*   **Example 5: Solving for the base (log base x of 27 = 3)**
    *   This translates to `x to the third power = 27` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
    *   To find x, we need the cubed root of 27 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
    *   `x = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, because `3 * 3 * 3 = 27` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
    *   So, `log base 3 of 27 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

*   **Example 6: log base 8 of 1/64**
    *   This asks `8 to what power = 1/64?` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
    *   Knowing that `8 squared = 64` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a> and applying [[Logarithm properties and rules | negative exponent rules]], `8 to the negative 2 power = 1/8 squared = 1/64` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
    *   Therefore, `log base 8 of 1/64 = -2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

## [[Special cases in logarithms | Special Cases in Logarithms]]

### Logarithm of 1

*   **log base 100 of 1**
    *   This means `100 to the question mark power = 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
    *   Any non-zero number raised to the 0-th power is equal to 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
    *   Thus, `log base 100 of 1 = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

### Logarithm of Zero

*   **log base 2 of 0**
    *   This asks `2 to some power x = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
    *   There is no number that 2 can be raised to the power of to get 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
    *   Therefore, `log base 2 of 0` is **undefined** or has no solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

### Logarithm of a Negative Number

*   **log base 3 of -1**
    *   This asks `3 to some power x = -1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
    *   Assuming real numbers, there is nothing that 3 can be raised to the power of to get a negative number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
    *   Therefore, `log base 3 of -1` is **undefined** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

> [!INFO] Important Rule
> For a logarithm `log base b of x` to be defined (in real numbers) when the base `b` is positive, the number `x` must be greater than 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. It cannot be 0 and it cannot be negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

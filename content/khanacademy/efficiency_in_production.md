Efficiency in production can be understood by analyzing the [[tradeoffs_in_resource_allocation | tradeoffs]] involved when allocating time or resources to produce different goods or services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This concept can be illustrated through a simple hunter-gatherer model, where an individual decides how to spend their time hunting rabbits or gathering berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Production Scenarios

To analyze the production possibilities, various scenarios are considered, assuming that all other factors remain constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### The Ceteris Paribus Assumption

When examining different production scenarios, economists often use the term [[ceteris_paribus_in_economic_analysis | ceteris paribus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This Latin phrase literally means "all other things equal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

> "When you're going from Scenario A to Scenario B you're not changing the amount of time you're sleeping. You're not changing somehow the geography where you are in a dramatic way. You're not changing the tools you use or the technology. Everything else is equal. The only variable you're changing is how much time you allocate to finding rabbits versus finding berries." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>

This assumption ensures that the only variable affecting the outcome is the one being studied â€“ in this case, the allocation of time between hunting and gathering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### Hunter-Gatherer Possibilities

The following table outlines various hypothetical production scenarios for a hunter-gatherer over a day, under the [[ceteris_paribus_in_economic_analysis | ceteris paribus]] assumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>:

| Scenario | Rabbits (per day) | Berries (per day) |
| :------- | :---------------- | :---------------- |
| A        | 5                 | 0                 |
| B        | 4                 | 100               |
| C        | 3                 | 180               |
| D        | 2                 | 240               |
| E        | 1                 | 280               |
| F        | 0                 | 300               |

*   **Scenario A**: Spending all available time on hunting yields 5 rabbits and 0 berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Scenario F**: Dedicating all time to gathering results in 0 rabbits and 300 berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   **Intermediate Scenarios (B-E)**: These represent different allocations of time, leading to varying combinations of rabbits and berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## The Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF)

The data from these scenarios can be used for [[graphing_and_interpreting_production_possibilities | graphing]] to create a visual representation of production capabilities. The number of rabbits can be plotted on one axis (e.g., vertical), and the number of berries on the other (e.g., horizontal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

Connecting these plotted points creates a curve known as the [[production_possibilities_frontier | production possibilities frontier]] (PPF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

### What the PPF Represents

The [[production_possibilities_frontier | production possibilities frontier]] is a curve that shows all the possible combinations of two goods that can be produced given available resources and technology, assuming efficient use of those resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

*   **Points on the PPF**: Any point *on* the curve (like scenarios A through F) represents an **efficient** allocation of resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. At these points, the hunter-gatherer is doing "the most you can do" with their time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. They are making the most use of their time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

*   **Points Outside the PPF**: Any point *beyond* or *to the right* of the curve is **impossible** to achieve with current resources and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. For instance, obtaining 5 rabbits and 200 berries simultaneously is impossible because if one is getting 5 rabbits, all time is spent on rabbits, leaving no time for berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

    > [00:09:17] "So this point is impossible. This point would be impossible. Any point that's on this side of the curve is impossible."

*   **Points Inside the PPF**: Any point *inside* or *to the left* of the curve is **possible** but represents an **inefficient** use of resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. For example, producing 1 rabbit and 200 berries is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. However, it is not optimal, as more berries or more rabbits could be obtained by utilizing time more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

    > [00:10:07] "But they aren't optimal. They are not efficient."

In essence, the [[production_possibilities_frontier | production possibilities frontier]] visually demonstrates the maximum output combinations of two goods that can be produced efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

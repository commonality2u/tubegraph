[[balancing_chemical_equations | Balancing chemical equations]] is a concept in chemistry that can initially confuse people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, by working carefully and methodically, and appreciating the "art" of [[balancing_chemical_equations | balancing chemical equations]], it becomes manageable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## What is a Chemical Equation?
A chemical equation describes a reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. For example, if an atom of aluminum is added to a dioxygen molecule (O₂), under appropriate conditions, they will react to form aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The aluminum oxide molecule contains two aluminum atoms and three oxygen atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This represents an example of [[understanding_chemical_equations_and_reactions | understanding chemical equations and reactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The initial equation might look like this:
```
Al + O₂ → Al₂O₃
```
In this equation, aluminum (Al) and dioxygen (O₂) are the [[understanding_reactants_and_products_in_chemical_reactions | reactants]], and aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) is the [[understanding_reactants_and_products_in_chemical_reactions | product]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

## Why Balance Chemical Equations?
The necessity for [[balancing_chemical_equations | balancing chemical equations]] arises because the number of each type of atom must be the same on both sides of the reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Atoms cannot simply appear or disappear out of thin air during a reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

Consider the example above:
*   **Aluminum (Al):** On the left side, there is one aluminum atom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. On the right side, there are two aluminum atoms in Al₂O₃ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **Oxygen (O):** On the left side, there are two oxygen atoms (in one O₂ molecule) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. On the right side, there are three oxygen atoms (in one Al₂O₃ molecule) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

Since the numbers are not equal, the equation is unbalanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## An Example of Balancing with Fractional Coefficients
One approach to [[steps_to_balance_chemical_equations | balancing chemical equations]] involves adjusting the coefficients of the molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

1.  **Balance Aluminum:** To balance the aluminum atoms, since there are two on the right and one on the left, a coefficient of `2` can be placed in front of the aluminum on the left side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
    ```
    2Al + O₂ → Al₂O₃
    ```
    Now there are two aluminum atoms on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

2.  **Balance Oxygen (Initial Attempt):** With aluminum balanced, attention turns to oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. There are two oxygen atoms on the left and three on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. To get three oxygens on the left, one might multiply the O₂ molecule by `1.5` (since 1.5 * 2 = 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
    ```
    2Al + 1.5O₂ → Al₂O₃
    ```
    This results in three oxygen atoms on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

## [[dealing_with_fractional_coefficients_in_chemical_equations | Dealing with Fractional Coefficients]]
A [[common_mistakes_in_balancing_chemical_equations | common mistake]] or issue is that chemical equations are typically written with whole-number coefficients, as the notion of "1.5 molecules" is not standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

To resolve this, all coefficients in the equation can be multiplied by a number that eliminates the fraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. In this case, multiplying all coefficients by `2` will convert `1.5` into a whole number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

Starting with the equation `2Al + 1.5O₂ → 1Al₂O₃` (implicitly, Al₂O₃ has a coefficient of 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>:

*   `2Al * 2 = 4Al` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>
*   `1.5O₂ * 2 = 3O₂` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>
*   `1Al₂O₃ * 2 = 2Al₂O₃` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>

The resulting balanced equation is:
```
4Al + 3O₂ → 2Al₂O₃
```

## Verification
To verify the final balanced equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>:

*   **Aluminum (Al):**
    *   Left side: `4` aluminum atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
    *   Right side: `2` (coefficient) * `2` (atoms in Al₂O₃) = `4` aluminum atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   **Oxygen (O):**
    *   Left side: `3` (coefficient) * `2` (atoms in O₂) = `6` oxygen atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
    *   Right side: `2` (coefficient) * `3` (atoms in Al₂O₃) = `6` oxygen atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

Both types of atoms are now balanced on both sides, making this an example of [[examples_of_balancing_chemical_equations | balancing chemical equations]] correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

[[introduction_to_trigonometry | Trigonometry]] is the study of the ratios of sides of triangles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The word "trig" in trigonometry literally means "triangle", and "metry" means "measure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This article provides an [[introduction_to_basic_trigonometry | introduction to basic trigonometry]] by explaining its core functions within the context of right triangles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Right Triangles

A [[application_of_trigonometry_in_right_triangles | right triangle]] is defined by having one angle that measures 90 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This angle is often marked with a square symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

In a right triangle:
*   The **hypotenuse** is the side opposite the right angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. It is always the longest side of a right triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Hypotenuses only exist in right triangles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   The sides of a right triangle satisfy the Pythagorean theorem (a² + b² = c²), where 'c' is the hypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. For example, a triangle with sides 3, 4, and 5 satisfies 3² + 4² = 5² <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Basic Trigonometric Functions and Definitions

The core [[trigonometric_functions_and_their_definitions | trigonometric functions]] are:
*   **Sine** (sin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>
*   **Cosine** (cos) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>
*   **Tangent** (tan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>

These functions specify the ratios of certain sides for any given angle within a right triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

### SOHCAHTOA Mnemonic

A useful mnemonic for remembering the definitions of these functions is [[sohcahtoa_mnemonic_for_trigonometric_functions | SOHCAHTOA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

> [!INFO] SOHCAHTOA
> **SOH**: **S**ine = **O**pposite / **H**ypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>
> **CAH**: **C**osine = **A**djacent / **H**ypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>
> **TOA**: **T**angent = **O**pposite / **A**djacent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>

When applying these definitions, "opposite" and "adjacent" refer to the sides relative to a specific angle in the triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. The hypotenuse remains constant for the triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

## Examples of Calculating Sine, Cosine, and Tangent

Let's use a right triangle with sides 3, 4, and hypotenuse 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Example 1: Angle Theta (θ)

Consider an angle, theta (θ), formed by the sides of length 4 and 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

*   **Opposite side to θ**: The side across from the angle, which is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **Adjacent side to θ**: The side next to the angle that is not the hypotenuse, which is 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   **Hypotenuse**: The side opposite the right angle, which is 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

Using these values, we can calculate the [[calculating_trigonometric_functions_sine_cosine_tangent | trigonometric functions]]:

*   **Sine (sin θ)**: Opposite / Hypotenuse = 3 / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>
*   **Cosine (cos θ)**: Adjacent / Hypotenuse = 4 / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>
*   **Tangent (tan θ)**: Opposite / Adjacent = 3 / 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>

### Example 2: Angle X

Now, let's consider another angle, x, in the same triangle, located at the top vertex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. This demonstrates [[applying_trigonometry_to_different_angles_in_a_triangle | how the opposite and adjacent sides change]] depending on the angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

*   **Opposite side to x**: The side across from angle x, which is 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   **Adjacent side to x**: The side next to angle x that is not the hypotenuse, which is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   **Hypotenuse**: Still 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

The [[examples_of_calculating_sine_cosine_and_tangent | trigonometric functions]] for angle x are:

*   **Sine (sin x)**: Opposite / Hypotenuse = 4 / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>
*   **Cosine (cos x)**: Adjacent / Hypotenuse = 3 / 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>
*   **Tangent (tan x)**: Opposite / Adjacent = 4 / 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>

### Beyond Right Triangles

The SOHCAHTOA definition is very useful for angles between 0 and 90 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. For angles approaching or exceeding 90 degrees, a more generalized definition of sine, cosine, and tangent is introduced, which is derived from the SOHCAHTOA definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

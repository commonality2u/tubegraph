The [[understanding_mode | mode]] is one of the ways to measure the [[mean_median_and_mode | central tendency]] of a set of numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## What is the Mode?

The [[understanding_mode | mode]] is defined as the number that appears most frequently in a given data set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Unlike the [[understanding_mean | mean]] or median, the [[understanding_mode | mode]] specifically identifies the value with the highest frequency of occurrence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## How to Identify the Mode

To identify the [[understanding_mode | mode]] in a set of numbers, simply count how many times each number appears. The number that occurs more often than any other number is the [[understanding_mode | mode]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

> All numbers show up once, except for 23, which shows up twice. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>

## Example

Consider the following set of numbers:
`23, 29, 20, 32, 23, 21, 33, 25` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>

To find the [[understanding_mode | mode]]:
1.  List the numbers: 23, 29, 20, 32, 23, 21, 33, 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>
2.  Count the occurrences of each number:
    *   20: 1 time
    *   21: 1 time
    *   23: 2 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>
    *   25: 1 time
    *   29: 1 time
    *   32: 1 time
    *   33: 1 time
3.  Identify the number that appears most frequently: The number 23 appears twice, while all other numbers appear only once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

Therefore, 23 is the [[understanding_mode | mode]] of this data set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

> [!INFO] A data set can have more than one [[understanding_mode | mode]] (multimodal) if multiple numbers share the highest frequency, or no [[understanding_mode | mode]] if all numbers appear with the same frequency. This specific example only shows one mode.

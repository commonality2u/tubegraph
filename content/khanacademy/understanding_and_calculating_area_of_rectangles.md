## What is Area?
[[basics_of_perimeter_and_area | Area]] is a measure of how much space a two-dimensional figure occupies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. It can be thought of as the number of 1-by-1 squares that can fit within a given figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

### Area vs. Perimeter
While [[basics_of_perimeter_and_area | perimeter]] is the distance around something, area measures the space it takes up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Rectangles
A rectangle is a four-sided figure with four right angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. In a rectangle, opposite sides are equal in length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### Calculating the Area of a Rectangle
To find the area of a rectangle, you multiply its length by its width <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. The formula is:

Area = Length × Width <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>

This concept is derived from how many [[explaining_area_using_1by1_squares | 1-by-1 squares]] can fit inside the rectangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

### Example: Area of Rectangle ABCD
Consider a rectangle ABCD with the following dimensions:
*   Side AB = 7 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>
*   Side BC = 5 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>

Since it's a rectangle, we know:
*   CD = AB = 7 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>
*   DA = BC = 5 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>

To calculate the area:
1.  Identify the length (7) and the width (5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
2.  Multiply these dimensions: 7 × 5 = 35 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

Therefore, the area of rectangle ABCD is 35 square units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. This means 35 [[explaining_area_using_1by1_squares | 1-by-1 squares]] can fit within the rectangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

### Fractional Dimensions
The principle applies even if dimensions are not whole numbers. For a rectangle with dimensions 1/2 by 2:
Area = 1/2 × 2 = 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
This indicates that the rectangle can fit one whole [[explaining_area_using_1by1_squares | 1-by-1 square]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

### Squares as Special Rectangles
A square is a special type of rectangle where all four sides are equal in length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. To find the area of a square, you multiply its side length by itself, which is also known as squaring the side length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
For example, a square with a side length of 2 has an area of 2 × 2 = 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

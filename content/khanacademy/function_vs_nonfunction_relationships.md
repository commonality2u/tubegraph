A function is a mathematical concept that takes an input, processes it, and produces a single, specific output based on that input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This means for every given input, there is only one possible output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

## [[definition_of_a_function | Definition of a Function]]

Abstractly, a [[definition_of_a_function | function]] takes an input, "munches" on it, does something to it, and produces a single, given output based on what the input is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The core rule is that a [[definition_of_a_function | function]] must produce only one possible output for any given input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

### [[function_notation | Function Notation]]

[[function_notation | Function notation]] typically uses `f(x)` where `f` is the name of the [[definition_of_a_function | function]] and `x` is the variable representing the input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. While `f` and `x` are common, other variables like `h` and `a` can also be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

To denote inputting a value into a [[definition_of_a_function | function]], you write the value inside the parentheses, such as `f(2)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This means you are asked to [[evaluating_functions | evaluate]] the [[definition_of_a_function | function]] `f` when its input is `2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Examples of Functions

Functions can be defined in various ways, not just through simple algebraic equations.

### Piecewise Function Example

Consider a [[definition_of_a_function | function]] `f(x)` defined as:
*   `x squared` if `x` is even <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>
*   `x plus 5` if `x` is odd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>

To [[evaluating_functions | evaluate]] this [[definition_of_a_function | function]]:
*   If the input `x` is 2 (`f(2)`), since 2 is even, `f(2) = 2² = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   If the input `x` is 3 (`f(3)`), since 3 is odd, `f(3) = 3 + 5 = 8` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

### Abstract Function Example

A [[definition_of_a_function | function]] doesn't have to operate on numbers in a purely mathematical sense. For instance, `h(a)` could be defined as "the next largest number that starts with the same letter as variable `a`" (assuming English numbers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

*   If the input `a` is 2 (`h(2)`), since "two" starts with 'T', the next largest number starting with 'T' is three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. So, `h(2) = 3`.
*   If the input `a` is 8 (`h(8)`), since "eight" starts with 'E', the next largest number starting with 'E' is eleven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. So, `h(8) = 11`.

This demonstrates that functions are a very general tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

### Common Equation as a Function

Many relationships expressed as [[difference_between_expressions_and_equations | equations]] are also functions. For example, the [[difference_between_expressions_and_equations | equation]] `y = x + 1` can be viewed as a [[definition_of_a_function | function]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. It can be written using [[function_notation | function notation]] as `f(x) = x + 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

*   If `x` is 0, `f(0) = 0 + 1 = 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   If `x` is 2, `f(2) = 2 + 1 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

Using [[function_notation | function notation]] makes it clear that the [[definition_of_a_function | function]] takes an input (`x`), processes it (`x + 1`), and produces an output (one more than the input) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

## What is Not a Function?

A relationship is *not* a [[definition_of_a_function | function]] if a single input can lead to more than one possible output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

### Circle Equation Example

Consider a circle with a radius of 2, centered at the origin, whose [[difference_between_expressions_and_equations | equation]] is `x² + y² = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

Visually, if you pick an `x` value (e.g., `x = 1`), there are two corresponding `y` values on the circle: one above the x-axis and one below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

Algebraically, if `x = 1` in the [[difference_between_expressions_and_equations | equation]] `x² + y² = 4`:
1.  `1² + y² = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>
2.  `1 + y² = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>
3.  `y² = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>
4.  `y = √3` or `y = -√3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>

Since the input `x = 1` yields two different outputs (`√3` and `-√3`), this relationship is not a [[definition_of_a_function | function]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. A [[definition_of_a_function | function]] cannot associate two different outputs with the same input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

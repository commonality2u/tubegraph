[[Solving algebraic equations | Solving more involved algebraic equations]] often requires [[isolating variables in algebraic equations | isolating the variable]] on one side of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The ultimate goal is to reach a state where the variable (e.g., 'x') is by itself, expressed as "x equals something" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This process involves applying a series of operations to both sides of the equation until the variable is isolated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Example: Solving 2x + 3 = 5x - 2

Consider the equation:
> 2x + 3 = 5x - 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>

This type of equation has variables on both sides and involves both addition and subtraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

### The Importance of Visualization

While performing [[algebraic techniques for solving equations | algebraic steps]], it can be helpful to visualize what is occurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This helps in understanding *why* certain operations are allowed and makes the process more intuitive, rather than just memorizing rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

For example, 2x + 3 can be visualized as two 'x' units and three '+1' units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Similarly, 5x - 2 is five 'x' units and two '-1' units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

### Step 1: Consolidate Variables (Subtract 2x from both sides)

The first step in [[solving equations with variables on both sides | solving equations with variables on both sides]] is often to gather all the variable terms on one side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. A common strategy is to subtract the smaller variable term from both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. In this case, subtracting 2x from both sides is reasonable because it will leave a positive number of x's on the right-hand side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

Algebraic Step:
> 2x + 3 = 5x - 2
> - 2x     - 2x
> ----------------
> 3 = 3x - 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>

Visualization: Removing two 'x' units from both sides of the visualized equation maintains balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. On the left, 2x is removed, leaving only +3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. On the right, 5x minus 2x leaves 3x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

### Step 2: Isolate the Variable Term (Add 2 to both sides)

Now that the variable terms are on one side, the next goal is to get rid of any constants on that same side to [[isolating variables in algebraic equations | isolate the variable term]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. To eliminate the -2 on the right side, add 2 to both sides of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

Algebraic Step:
> 3 = 3x - 2
> + 2      + 2
> ---------------
> 5 = 3x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>

Visualization: Adding two '+1' units to both sides of the equation. On the right, the two '+1' units cancel out the two '-1' units (negative 2), leaving only the '3x' units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. On the left, 3 + 2 results in 5 '+1' units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

### Step 3: Solve for the Variable (Divide by 3)

The equation is now in the form "constant = coefficient * variable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. To [[isolating variables in algebraic equations | isolate the variable]], divide both sides by its coefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. The coefficient is the number multiplying the variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

Algebraic Step:
> 5 = 3x
> 5 / 3 = 3x / 3
> ---------------
> 5/3 = x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>

The solution can be written as x = 5/3 or as a mixed number, x = 1 2/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Both forms are completely equivalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

Visualization: Dividing both sides by 3 means separating the units into three equal groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. If 5 units are divided into 3 groups, each group contains 1 2/3 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. On the right, 3x divided into 3 groups yields one 'x' per group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Thus, x = 1 2/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

The final answer, x = 1 2/3, can be substituted back into the original equation to verify its correctness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

The term "ceteris paribus" is a general term used in economics to signify that "all other things are equal" or "all other things being held equal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. The Latin phrase literally translates to "all other things equal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. It is used to simplify economic analysis by focusing on the relationship between specific variables while assuming other factors remain constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Application in Analysis

When economists discuss changes in one variable, they often assume "ceteris paribus" to isolate the effect of that specific change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. For example, in a scenario involving a hunter-gatherer deciding how to allocate their time between hunting rabbits and gathering berries, various possibilities or "scenarios" can be analyzed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

In this context, when moving from one scenario to another (e.g., from Scenario A to Scenario B) where the allocation of time changes, the assumption of ceteris paribus means that:
*   The amount of sleep remains unchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   The geography or environment does not dramatically change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   The tools or technology used for hunting or gathering do not change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   The total amount of time available for hunting or gathering stays the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   No other activities are being pursued with the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

Essentially, the *only* variable being changed is the time allocation between hunting rabbits and gathering berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This isolation of variables allows for a clearer understanding of the tradeoffs involved and how different combinations of outputs can be achieved given fixed resources and technology. These combinations form a [[efficiency_in_production | production possibilities frontier]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

> [!info] The term "ceteris" is related to "et cetera," which also means "and other things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

This concept is fundamental in [[role_of_mathematics_and_assumptions_in_economics | economic modeling and prediction]], allowing economists to make specific predictions about the impact of one variable without needing to account for every possible influencing factor simultaneously.

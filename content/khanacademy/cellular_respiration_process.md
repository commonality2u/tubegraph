Cellular respiration is considered the single most important biochemical reaction, especially for living organisms, because it is the primary way to derive energy from consumed food or fuel, specifically glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Most carbohydrates consumed are eventually converted into glucose, which then fuels this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Chemical Equation

The overall chemical reaction for cellular respiration, while a gross simplification of a highly involved mechanism, illustrates the basic inputs and outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>:

One mole of glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆) combines with six moles of molecular oxygen (O₂) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Through the process of [[cellular_respiration_process | cellular respiration]], this yields six moles of carbon dioxide (CO₂), six moles of water (H₂O), and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This energy is vital for various bodily functions, including useful work, heating the body, and providing electrical impulses in the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

```
C₆H₁₂O₆ (Glucose) + 6O₂ (Oxygen) → 6CO₂ (Carbon Dioxide) + 6H₂O (Water) + Energy
```

## Energy Production (ATP)

While cellular respiration produces energy directly, this energy is primarily used to produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. ATP is considered the energy currency for biological systems, readily used by cells for functions like muscle contraction, nerve impulse generation, growth, and division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

A portion of the energy produced is released as heat, which helps warm the cell and maintain body temperature, essential for proper cell operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Textbooks often state that cellular respiration produces 38 ATP molecules from one mole of glucose under ideal circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. However, in reality, depending on cellular efficiency, the yield is typically closer to 29 to 30 ATPs, and this number is still under study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

## [[stages_of_cellular_respiration | Stages of Cellular Respiration]]

[[cellular_respiration_process | Cellular respiration]] is broken down into constituent parts:

### 1. [[glycolysis_process_and_phases | Glycolysis]]
The first stage is [[glycolysis_process_and_its_role_in_breaking_down_glucose | glycolysis]], which literally means "breaking up glucose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. This process takes a 6-carbon glucose molecule and breaks its carbon backbone into two 3-carbon molecules called pyruvate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

*   **ATP Yield**: [[glycolysis_process_and_phases | Glycolysis]] consumes 2 ATPs but generates 4 ATPs, resulting in a net gain of 2 ATPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   **Oxygen Requirement**: This stage is an [[anaerobic_vs_aerobic_processes_in_cells | anaerobic process]], meaning it does not require oxygen to occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **NADH Production**: Glycolysis also produces NADH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) molecules, which are crucial for later stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

### 2. Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle)
After [[glycolysis_process_and_phases | glycolysis]], the pyruvate byproducts are re-engineered and enter the [[enzymecatalyzed_reactions_in_the_Krebs_cycle | Krebs cycle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

*   **ATP Yield**: The [[enzymecatalyzed_reactions_in_the_Krebs_cycle | Krebs cycle]] generates an additional 2 ATPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   **Oxygen Requirement**: This is an [[anaerobic_vs_aerobic_processes_in_cells | aerobic process]], meaning it requires oxygen to be present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.
*   **NADH/FADH Production**: The [[enzymecatalyzed_reactions_in_the_Krebs_cycle | Krebs cycle]] produces a significant amount of NADH and FADH (reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide), which are vital for the electron transport chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.

### 3. Electron Transport Chain
The [[electron_transport_chain_process | electron transport chain]] typically follows the [[enzymecatalyzed_reactions_in_the_Krebs_cycle | Krebs cycle]] and is responsible for producing the bulk of ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

*   **ATP Yield**: This stage is credited with producing about 34 ATPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
*   **Oxygen Requirement**: This is also an [[anaerobic_vs_aerobic_processes_in_cells | aerobic process]], requiring oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
*   **Role of NADH/FADH**: The NADH and FADH molecules produced in [[glycolysis_process_and_phases | glycolysis]] and the [[enzymecatalyzed_reactions_in_the_Krebs_cycle | Krebs cycle]] are what drive the [[electron_transport_chain_process | electron transport chain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

## Anaerobic Respiration (Fermentation)

When oxygen is not available, the subsequent stages of cellular respiration (Krebs cycle and electron transport chain) cannot proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. In this scenario, the byproducts of [[glycolysis_process_and_phases | glycolysis]] enter a side process called fermentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. This pathway allows for the continued, albeit limited, production of energy (the 2 net ATPs from [[glycolysis_process_and_phases | glycolysis]]).

*   **Alcohol Fermentation**: Some organisms, like yeast, undergo alcohol fermentation, where [[glycolysis_process_and_phases | glycolysis]] byproducts are converted into alcohol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
*   **Lactic Acid Fermentation**: Human muscles, when oxygen becomes scarce (e.g., during intense sprinting), perform lactic acid fermentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. The buildup of lactic acid can lead to muscle ache <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

In summary, [[cellular_respiration_process | cellular respiration]] is the process of repackaging the energy from glucose into ATP, primarily through the three main [[stages_of_cellular_respiration | stages of cellular respiration]]: [[glycolysis_process_and_phases | glycolysis]], the [[enzymecatalyzed_reactions_in_the_Krebs_cycle | Krebs cycle]], and the [[electron_transport_chain_process | electron transport chain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.# Cellular Respiration Process

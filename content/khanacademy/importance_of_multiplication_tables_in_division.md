To effectively divide into larger numbers, a foundational understanding and memorization of [[importance_and_utility_of_multiplication | multiplication tables]] are essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This includes knowing tables from 1x1 up to at least 10x10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, or even up to 12x12 as traditionally taught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Division as Inverse of Multiplication

Division problems can often be quickly solved by reframing them as [[basics_of_multiplication | multiplication]] questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

For example:
*   **25 divided by 5**: This can be thought of as "5 times what equals 25?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Knowing the 5-multiplication tables reveals that 5 times 5 is 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, so 25 divided by 5 is 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **49 divided by 7**: This is equivalent to "7 times what equals 49?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. The [[importance_and_utility_of_multiplication | multiplication tables]] confirm that 7 times 7 is 49 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **54 divided by 9**: To solve this, one asks "9 times what equals 54?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. By recalling or incrementally calculating (e.g., 9 times 5 is 45, so 9 times 6 is 9 more, or 54) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, it's found that 9 goes into 54 six times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

Knowing these basic [[importance_and_utility_of_multiplication | multiplication tables]] allows for quick solutions to fundamental division problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Division with Remainders

Not all division problems result in a clean whole number. In these cases, [[importance_and_utility_of_multiplication | multiplication tables]] help identify the largest multiple that fits, and the remainder is then calculated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

For example, to divide 23 by 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>:
1.  List multiples of 3: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
2.  Notice that 23 is not a multiple of 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
3.  The largest multiple of 3 that goes into 23 is 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
4.  Since 3 times 7 is 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, 3 goes into 23 seven times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
5.  Subtracting 21 from 23 leaves a remainder of 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
6.  Thus, 23 divided by 3 is 7 with a remainder of 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## Long Division with Larger Numbers

For larger numbers, [[importance_and_utility_of_multiplication | multiplication tables]] are critical for breaking down the problem into manageable steps, often utilizing [[understanding_place_value_in_division | place value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

### Example: 344 divided by 4

1.  **Start with the leftmost digit**: Determine how many times 4 goes into 3. It goes in 0 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
2.  **Consider the first two digits**: How many times does 4 go into 34? Using the 4-multiplication tables:
    *   4 times 8 is 32 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
    *   4 times 9 is 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a> (too large for 34) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
    *   So, 4 goes into 34 eight times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
3.  **Place the quotient**: Write the 8 above the 4 in the tens place (since we divided into 34 tens, or 340) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
4.  **Multiply and subtract**: 8 times 4 is 32. Subtract 32 from 34, leaving a remainder of 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. This 2 is actually 2 tens, or 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
5.  **Bring down the next digit**: Bring down the 4, making the new number 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
6.  **Divide again**: How many times does 4 go into 24? From the [[importance_and_utility_of_multiplication | multiplication tables]], 4 times 6 is 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
7.  **Place the quotient**: Write the 6 in the ones place above the 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
8.  **Multiply and subtract**: 6 times 4 is 24. Subtract 24 from 24, leaving 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
9.  The result is 86 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

### Example: 91 divided by 7

1.  **Divide the first digit**: 7 goes into 9 one time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
2.  **Place the quotient**: Write 1 above the 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
3.  **Multiply and subtract**: 1 times 7 is 7. Subtract 7 from 9, resulting in 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. (This 1 is in the tens place, so 10 times 7 is 70, and 91 minus 70 is 21) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
4.  **Bring down the next digit**: Bring down the 1, forming 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
5.  **Divide again**: How many times does 7 go into 21? From [[importance_and_utility_of_multiplication | multiplication tables]], 7 times 3 is 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
6.  **Place the quotient**: Write 3 in the ones place next to the 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
7.  **Multiply and subtract**: 3 times 7 is 21. Subtract 21 from 21, resulting in 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
8.  The result is 13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

### Example: 608 divided by 8

1.  **Divide the first digit**: 8 goes into 6 zero times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
2.  **Consider the first two digits**: How many times does 8 go into 60?
    *   8 times 7 is 56 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
    *   8 times 8 is 64 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a> (too large) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
    *   So, 8 goes into 60 seven times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.
3.  **Place the quotient**: Write 7 above the 0 in 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
4.  **Multiply and subtract**: 7 times 8 is 56. Subtract 56 from 60, leaving 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
5.  **Bring down the next digit**: Bring down the 8, forming 48 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
6.  **Divide again**: How many times does 8 go into 48? From [[importance_and_utility_of_multiplication | multiplication tables]], 8 times 6 is exactly 48 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.
7.  **Place the quotient**: Write 6 next to the 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.
8.  **Multiply and subtract**: 6 times 8 is 48. Subtract 48 from 48, leaving 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
9.  The result is 76 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

In summary, having [[importance_and_utility_of_multiplication | multiplication tables]] memorized up to at least 10x10 or 12x12 is a fundamental requirement for efficiently tackling basic and larger [[basic_steps_in_long_division | long division]] problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

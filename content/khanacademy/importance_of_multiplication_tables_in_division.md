To effectively [[division_with_larger_numbers | divide into larger numbers]], a foundational knowledge of multiplication tables is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This means memorizing tables from 1 times 1 up to at least 10 times 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, or even 12 times 12 as was traditionally taught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This mastery allows for quick and accurate solutions to various [[multiplication_and_division_in_equations | division problems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## Division as Inverse Multiplication

Understanding the relationship between [[understanding_basic_multiplication | multiplication]] and division is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. A division problem, such as 25 divided by 5, can be rephrased as asking, "5 times what number equals 25?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. If you know your 5-multiplication tables, you can quickly identify that 5 times 5 is 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, making the division result immediately apparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

Similarly:
*   To solve 49 divided by 7, one can think "7 times what equals 49?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. The answer, from multiplication tables, is 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   For 54 divided by 9, the question becomes "9 times what equals 54?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Knowledge of multiplication tables reveals that 9 times 6 is 54 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Applying Multiplication Tables in Long Division

Even when a number does not divide perfectly, or when dealing with [[division_with_larger_numbers | larger numbers]] beyond basic multiplication facts, multiplication tables are indispensable for [[introduction_to_long_division | long division]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

### Division with Remainders

When dividing a number that is not a direct multiple of the divisor, multiplication tables help find the closest multiple and the remainder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. For example, to divide 23 by 3:
1.  List multiples of 3: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
2.  Identify the largest multiple of 3 that is less than or equal to 23, which is 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
3.  Recall that 3 times 7 equals 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
4.  Subtracting 21 from 23 leaves a remainder of 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
5.  Thus, 23 divided by 3 is 7 with a remainder of 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

### Step-by-Step Long Division

For [[stepbystep_process_for_basic_division_problems | basic division problems]] with larger numbers, the process relies on breaking down the dividend and applying multiplication facts repeatedly:

**Example: 344 divided by 4** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>
1.  Start by seeing how many times 4 goes into the first digit, 3. It goes in 0 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
2.  Consider the first two digits, 34. Using the 4-multiplication tables, find the largest multiple of 4 less than or equal to 34 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
    *   4 times 8 equals 32 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
    *   4 times 9 equals 36 (too large) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
3.  So, 4 goes into 34 eight times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Write "8" in the tens place above the 34 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
4.  Multiply 8 by 4 (which is 32) and subtract it from 34, leaving 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
5.  Bring down the next digit (4) to form 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
6.  Determine how many times 4 goes into 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
    *   From multiplication tables, 4 times 6 equals 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
7.  Write "6" in the ones place above the 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
8.  Multiply 6 by 4 (which is 24) and subtract it from 24, leaving 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
9.  The final answer is 86, with no remainder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

This [[stepbystep_process_for_basic_division_problems | step-by-step process]] fundamentally relies on knowing multiplication tables to perform the "how many times does it go in?" and "what's left over?" calculations at each stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

Within eukaryotic cells, specific [[organelle_functions_such_as_ribosomes_endoplasmic_reticulum_and_golgi_bodies | organelles]] are responsible for vital energy processes such as cellular respiration and photosynthesis. These include mitochondria and chloroplasts. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>

## Mitochondria

Mitochondria are [[organelle_functions_such_as_ribosomes_endoplasmic_reticulum_and_golgi_bodies | organelles]] found in cells, playing a central role in [[Energy production through cellular respiration | energy production through cellular respiration]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>

### Structure and Function
Mitochondria possess distinct inner and outer membranes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a> They are the site where [[Introduction to Cellular Respiration | cellular respiration]] occurs, converting sugars into [[Electron transport chain and ATP production | ATP]] for energy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>

### Endosymbiotic Theory
A notable characteristic of mitochondria is that they contain their own DNA and can reproduce independently within the cell. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a> This has led to the belief that their ancestors were once independent prokaryotic organisms. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a> Over time, these prokaryotes are thought to have developed a symbiotic relationship, living inside larger eukaryotic cells. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>

## Chloroplasts

Chloroplasts are [[organelle_functions_such_as_ribosomes_endoplasmic_reticulum_and_golgi_bodies | organelles]] found exclusively in plant cells and other non-animal cells. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>

### Structure and Function
Chloroplasts are a type of plastid and are the primary site for photosynthesis. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a> Their internal structure includes thylakoids and grana, which are essential for the photosynthetic process. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>

### Endosymbiotic Theory
Similar to mitochondria, chloroplasts also possess their own DNA and ribosomes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a> This suggests that their ancestors were once independent prokaryotes that eventually formed a symbiotic relationship within larger eukaryotic cells. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>

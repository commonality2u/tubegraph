The [[right_triangles_and_the_pythagorean_theorem | Pythagorean theorem]] is a fundamental concept used to define the relationship between the sides of a [[right_triangles_and_trigonometry | right triangle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Definition and Scope

The [[right_triangles_and_the_pythagorean_theorem | Pythagorean theorem]] specifically applies to [[right_triangles_and_trigonometry | right triangles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. If an angle is not part of a [[right_triangles_and_trigonometry | right triangle]], it is often necessary to construct a [[right_triangles_and_trigonometry | right triangle]] to apply trigonometric functions or the [[right_triangles_and_the_pythagorean_theorem | Pythagorean theorem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

The theorem states that the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. If 'h' represents the hypotenuse and 'a' and 'b' represent the other two sides, the formula is:
`h² = a² + b²` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>

## Examples

### Finding the Hypotenuse

Consider a [[right_triangles_and_trigonometry | right triangle]] with sides of length 7 and 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. To find the hypotenuse 'h':
*   Apply the [[right_triangles_and_the_pythagorean_theorem | Pythagorean theorem]]: `h² = 7² + 4²` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   Calculate the squares: `h² = 49 + 16` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   Sum the values: `h² = 65` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   Take the square root of both sides: `h = √65` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   The square root of 65 cannot be simplified further as it is `13 × 5`, and both 13 and 5 are prime numbers and not perfect squares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### Verifying a Right Triangle

To verify if a given triangle with sides 2, `2√3`, and 4 is a [[right_triangles_and_trigonometry | right triangle]], check if the sides satisfy the [[right_triangles_and_the_pythagorean_theorem | Pythagorean theorem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. The longest side, 4, would be the hypotenuse.
*   Square the two shorter sides and sum them: `(2√3)² + 2²` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   Calculate the squares: `(4 × 3) + 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   Simplify: `12 + 4 = 16` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
*   Compare to the square of the hypotenuse: `4² = 16` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   Since `16 = 16`, the triangle satisfies the [[right_triangles_and_the_pythagorean_theorem | Pythagorean theorem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. This specific triangle is also recognizable as a [[trigonometric_functions_in_30_60_90_triangles | 30-60-90 triangle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

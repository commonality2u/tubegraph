From: [[khanacademy]] <br/> 

The [[properties_of_right_triangles | Pythagorean theorem]] is a fundamental principle in geometry, specifically applied to [[properties_of_right_triangles | right triangles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. It establishes a relationship between the lengths of the sides of a [[properties_of_right_triangles | right triangle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.

## Definition

A [[properties_of_right_triangles | right triangle]] is defined by having one angle that measures exactly 90 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>, also known as a right angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. The side opposite the 90-degree angle is called the hypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. The hypotenuse is always the longest side of a [[properties_of_right_triangles | right triangle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.

The [[properties_of_right_triangles | Pythagorean theorem]] states that the square of the length of the two shorter sides (legs) of a [[properties_of_right_triangles | right triangle]], when added together, is equal to the square of the length of the hypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. If 'a' and 'b' represent the lengths of the legs, and 'c' represents the length of the hypotenuse, the theorem can be expressed as:
a² + b² = c²

## Example

Consider a [[properties_of_right_triangles | right triangle]] with sides of length 3, 4, and 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.
*   One side (height) is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.
*   The base of the triangle is 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.
*   The hypotenuse is 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.

To verify that these sides satisfy the [[properties_of_right_triangles | Pythagorean theorem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>:
*   3² + 4² = 5² <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>
*   9 + 16 = 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>
*   25 = 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>

This confirms that the side lengths 3, 4, and 5 form a [[properties_of_right_triangles | right triangle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

From: [[khanacademy]] <br/> 

The [[introduction_to_the_quadratic_formula | quadratic formula]] is considered one of the top five most useful formulas in mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. While memorization is generally discouraged, it is recommended to memorize this formula, with the caveat that one also understands its proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Its primary purpose is to [[solving_quadratic_equations | solve for the roots]], or zeroes, of [[solving_quadratic_equations | quadratic equations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## The Quadratic Equation Standard Form

A general [[solving_quadratic_equations | quadratic equation]] is typically expressed in the form:
`ax² + bx + c = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>

In this form:
*   `a` is the coefficient of the x-squared term (second-degree term) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   `b` is the coefficient of the x-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   `c` is the constant term (or coefficient of x to the zero term) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## The Quadratic Formula

Given a general [[solving_quadratic_equations | quadratic equation]] in the form `ax² + bx + c = 0`, the [[introduction_to_the_quadratic_formula | quadratic formula]] states that the solutions for `x` are:

`x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>

This formula is derived by [[quadratic_equations_transformation | completing the square]] on the general [[solving_quadratic_equations | quadratic equation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Application Examples

The [[introduction_to_the_quadratic_formula | quadratic formula]] is a powerful [[solving_techniques_for_quadratic_equations | solving technique]] because it works even for problems that are difficult or impossible to [[factoring_quadratic_equations | factor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

### Example 1: Factorable Quadratic Equation

Let's [[solving_quadratic_equations | solve]] the equation `x² + 4x - 21 = 0` using the [[introduction_to_the_quadratic_formula | quadratic formula]] and compare it to [[factoring_quadratic_equations | factoring]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

1.  **Identify a, b, c**:
    *   `a = 1` (coefficient of x²) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>
    *   `b = 4` (coefficient of x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>
    *   `c = -21` (constant term) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>

2.  **Plug values into the formula**:
    `x = (-4 ± √(4² - 4 * 1 * -21)) / (2 * 1)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>

3.  **Simplify**:
    *   `x = (-4 ± √(16 - (-84))) / 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>
    *   `x = (-4 ± √(16 + 84)) / 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>
    *   `x = (-4 ± √100) / 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>
    *   `x = (-4 ± 10) / 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>
    *   `x = -2 ± 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>

4.  **Find the two solutions**:
    *   `x = -2 + 5 = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>
    *   `x = -2 - 5 = -7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>

**Comparison with Factoring**:
To [[factoring_quadratic_equations | factor]] `x² + 4x - 21 = 0`:
*   Find two numbers that multiply to -21 and add to 4 (these are 7 and -3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
*   `(x + 7)(x - 3) = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>
*   `x + 7 = 0` or `x - 3 = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>
*   `x = -7` or `x = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>

Both [[methods_for_solving_quadratic_equations | methods]] yield the same answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

### Example 2: Quadratic Equation with No Real Solutions

Consider the equation `3x² + 6x = -10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

1.  **Transform to standard form**: Add 10 to both sides to get `3x² + 6x + 10 = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

2.  **Identify a, b, c**:
    *   `a = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>
    *   `b = 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>
    *   `c = 10` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>

3.  **Plug values into the formula**:
    `x = (-6 ± √(6² - 4 * 3 * 10)) / (2 * 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>

4.  **Simplify**:
    *   `x = (-6 ± √(36 - 120)) / 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>
    *   `x = (-6 ± √(-84)) / 6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>

**Interpretation of Result**:
The presence of a negative number under the square root (`√(-84)`) means there are no real solutions for this equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. This `b² - 4ac` term is called the discriminant. If the discriminant is negative, there are no real solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. In more advanced mathematics, solutions involving [[applications_of_the_quadratic_formula_in_solving_complex_equations | imaginary numbers]] can be found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

**Graphical Verification**:
Graphing the function `y = 3x² + 6x + 10` shows that the parabola never intersects the x-axis, confirming there are no real roots (where `y=0`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

### Example 3: Quadratic Equation with Irreducible Radical

Let's [[solving_quadratic_equations | solve]] ` -3x² + 12x + 1 = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

1.  **Identify a, b, c**:
    *   `a = -3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>
    *   `b = 12` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>
    *   `c = 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>

2.  **Plug values into the formula**:
    `x = (-12 ± √(12² - 4 * -3 * 1)) / (2 * -3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>

3.  **Simplify**:
    *   `x = (-12 ± √(144 - (-12))) / -6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>
    *   `x = (-12 ± √(144 + 12)) / -6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>
    *   `x = (-12 ± √156) / -6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>

4.  **Simplify the radical (√156)**:
    *   Prime factorization of 156: `156 = 2 * 78 = 2 * 2 * 39` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>
    *   `√156 = √(2² * 39) = 2√39` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>

5.  **Substitute simplified radical back and finalize**:
    *   `x = (-12 ± 2√39) / -6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>
    *   Divide numerator and denominator by 2:
        `x = (-6 ± √39) / -3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>
    *   Separate the terms:
        `x = -6/-3 ± √39/-3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>
        `x = 2 ± (√39 / -3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>
    *   The `±` sign absorbs the negative in the denominator, so the final form is:
        `x = 2 ± (√39 / 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>

**Graphical Verification**:
Graphing `y = -3x² + 12x + 1` shows that it intersects the x-axis at two points, one a little more than 4, and another a little less than 1, consistent with the calculated values (since √39 is slightly more than 6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.

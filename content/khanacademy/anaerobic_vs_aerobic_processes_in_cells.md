[[cellular_respiration_process | Cellular respiration]] is described as the single most important biochemical reaction, especially for humans, as it's how living organisms derive energy from fuel, specifically glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Most carbohydrates consumed by organisms ultimately become glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The overall chemical reaction for [[cellular_respiration_process | cellular respiration]] involves one mole of glucose (C6H12O6) and six moles of molecular oxygen (O2) to produce six moles of carbon dioxide (CO2), six moles of water (H2O), and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

This energy is used for various biological functions, such as muscle contraction, nerve impulses, body heat, growth, and cell division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. While [[cellular_respiration_process | cellular respiration]] produces energy directly, this energy is primarily used to produce [[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | ATP]], which is considered the energy currency for biological systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. A typical ideal yield is 38 [[atp_production_in_glycolysis | ATPs]] per glucose molecule, although in reality, it's often closer to 29 to 30 [[atp_production_in_glycolysis | ATPs]] due to cellular efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

[[cellular_respiration_process | Cellular respiration]] is a complex process broken down into several [[stages_of_cellular_respiration | stages]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

### Anaerobic Processes

Anaerobic processes do not require oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

*   **[[glycolysis_process_and_phases | Glycolysis]]**
    The first [[stages_of_cellular_respiration | stage]] of [[cellular_respiration_process | cellular respiration]] is [[glycolysis_process_and_phases | glycolysis]], which literally means "breaking up glucose" ("glyco" for glucose, "lysis" for break up) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. In [[glycolysis_process_and_phases | glycolysis]], a 6-carbon glucose molecule is broken down into two 3-carbon molecules called pyruvate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. This process occurs in the absence of oxygen and is therefore considered an anaerobic process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
    *   **[[atp_production_in_glycolysis | ATP Production]]**: [[glycolysis_process_and_phases | Glycolysis]] requires two [[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | ATPs]] to start and generates four [[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | ATPs]], resulting in a net gain of two [[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | ATPs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
    *   **[[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | NAD]]H Production**: [[glycolysis_process_and_phases | Glycolysis]] also produces [[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | NADH]] by taking [[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | NAD]]+ and adding hydrogens to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. These [[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | NADH]] molecules are crucial for later [[stages_of_cellular_respiration | stages]] that occur in the presence of oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

*   **Fermentation**
    If oxygen is not available, the byproducts of [[glycolysis_process_and_phases | glycolysis]] do not proceed to the [[enzymecatalyzed_reactions_in_the_krebs_cycle | Krebs cycle]] or the electron transport chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. Instead, they enter an alternative anaerobic process called fermentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
    *   **Alcohol Fermentation**: Some organisms, like yeast, perform alcohol fermentation, producing alcohol from the byproducts of [[glycolysis_process_and_phases | glycolysis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
    *   **Lactic Acid Fermentation**: Human muscles, when deprived of sufficient oxygen (e.g., during intense sprinting), perform lactic acid fermentation, leading to lactic acid buildup that can cause muscle aches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. Fermentation allows for a small amount of [[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | ATP]] production but is nowhere near as efficient as aerobic processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

### Aerobic Processes

Aerobic processes require oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

*   **[[enzymecatalyzed_reactions_in_the_krebs_cycle | Krebs Cycle]]**
    Following [[glycolysis_process_and_phases | glycolysis]], the pyruvate molecules are further processed before entering the [[enzymecatalyzed_reactions_in_the_krebs_cycle | Krebs cycle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. The [[enzymecatalyzed_reactions_in_the_krebs_cycle | Krebs cycle]] is an aerobic process, meaning it requires oxygen to proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.
    *   **[[atp_production_in_glycolysis | ATP Production]]**: The [[enzymecatalyzed_reactions_in_the_krebs_cycle | Krebs cycle]] directly generates another two [[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | ATPs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
    *   **[[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | NAD]]H and FADH Production**: Critically, the [[enzymecatalyzed_reactions_in_the_krebs_cycle | Krebs cycle]] (along with [[glycolysis_process_and_phases | glycolysis]]) produces a significant number of [[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | NADH]] and FADH2 molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. These molecules are essential for the final and most energy-productive [[stages_of_cellular_respiration | stage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

*   **Electron Transport Chain**
    The electron transport chain is the final and most productive [[stages_of_cellular_respiration | stage]] of [[cellular_respiration_process | cellular respiration]] and is also an aerobic process, requiring oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
    *   **[[atp_production_in_glycolysis | ATP Production]]**: This [[stages_of_cellular_respiration | stage]] is responsible for producing the bulk of [[atp_production_in_glycolysis | ATPs]], approximately 34 [[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | ATPs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
    *   **Driven by [[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | NAD]]H and FADH**: The electron transport chain is primarily driven by the [[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | NADH]] (around 10 molecules from [[glycolysis_process_and_phases | glycolysis]] and the [[enzymecatalyzed_reactions_in_the_krebs_cycle | Krebs cycle]]) and FADH2 molecules produced in the earlier [[stages_of_cellular_respiration | stages]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

### Summary of [[stages_of_cellular_respiration | Stages]] and Energy Yield

| [[stages_of_cellular_respiration | Stage]]              | Oxygen Requirement | Net [[atp_production_in_glycolysis | ATP]] (direct) | Other Products |
| :----------------------- | :----------------- | :----------------- | :------------- |
| [[glycolysis_process_and_phases | Glycolysis]]       | Anaerobic          | 2 [[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | ATPs]]             | [[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | NADH]], Pyruvate |
| [[enzymecatalyzed_reactions_in_the_krebs_cycle | Krebs Cycle]]        | Aerobic            | 2 [[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | ATPs]]             | [[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | NADH]], FADH2, CO2 |
| Electron Transport Chain | Aerobic            | 34 [[role_of_atp_and_nad_in_glycolysis | ATPs]]            | Water          |

The presence of oxygen allows for a much greater yield of [[atp_production_in_glycolysis | ATP]] from glucose compared to anaerobic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. While [[glycolysis_process_and_phases | glycolysis]] can provide a small amount of energy without oxygen, the bulk of the energy is derived when oxygen is available for the aerobic [[stages_of_cellular_respiration | stages]] of the [[enzymecatalyzed_reactions_in_the_krebs_cycle | Krebs cycle]] and the electron transport chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

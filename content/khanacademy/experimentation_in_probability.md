In probability, an **experiment** refers to any random event being observed or performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. This differs from the common understanding of an experiment in chemistry or physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. In probability, each instance of performing a random event, such as flipping a coin or rolling a die, is considered a single trial of an experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.

## Conceptualizing Probability through Experimentation

One way to conceptualize [[probability_calculation | probability]] is to imagine running an experiment many, many times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. By observing the outcomes over a large number of trials, one can determine the percentage of times a specific outcome or "event" occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. The more times the experiment is run, the closer the observed percentage will get to the theoretical probability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.

### Coin Flip Experiment

Consider flipping a [[understanding_fair_coins_and_probability | fair coin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. A fair coin has an equal chance of landing on heads or tails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.
*   **Equally Likely Possibilities**: There are two equally likely possibilities: heads or tails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
*   **Probability of Heads**: The [[probability_calculation | probability]] of getting heads in a single flip is 1 out of 2, or 1/2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. This can also be expressed as 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

If one were to flip a coin a million or a billion times, approximately 50% of those flips would result in heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. While there's always a small chance of unusual outcomes (like all tails in a million flips), the more trials conducted, the more the results will "trend towards 50%" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>.

### Die Roll Experiment

Another common example is rolling a [[calculating_probability_with_dice | fair die]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.
*   **Equally Likely Possibilities**: A standard die has six equally likely possibilities: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>.
*   **Probability of Rolling a 1**: The [[probability_calculation | probability]] of getting a 1 is 1 out of 6, or 1/6, because only one outcome meets the condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.
*   **Probability of Rolling a 1 or a 6**: The [[probability_calculation | probability]] of getting a 1 or a 6 is 2 out of 6, or 1/3, as two outcomes meet the condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>.
*   **Probability of Rolling a 2 and a 3 (in one roll)**: This is 0, because getting a 2 and a 3 on a single roll are [[mutually_exclusive_events_in_probability | mutually exclusive events]] and cannot happen simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>.
*   **Probability of Rolling an Even Number**: The [[probability_calculation | probability]] of rolling an even number is 3 out of 6 (2, 4, or 6), or 1/2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>.

By repeating these experiments many times, the observed frequency of an [[events_and_outcomes_in_probability | event]] will converge on its theoretical [[probability_calculation | probability]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. This concept of running experiments multiple times is a helpful way to understand [[introduction_to_probability | probability]] in general <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.

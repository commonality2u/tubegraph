A function is an abstract concept that takes an input, processes it, and produces a single, given output based on that input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Defining a Function

Typically, the variable 'x' is used for the input into a function, and 'f' is often used as the name of the function, though other variables can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

### Examples of Functions

A function can be defined with conditional rules. For instance, `f(x)` could be defined as:
*   `x` squared if `x` is even <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>
*   `x` plus 5 if `x` is odd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>

To evaluate such a function:
*   If the input is 2 (even), `f(2)` is 2 squared, resulting in 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   If the input is 3 (odd), `f(3)` is 3 plus 5, resulting in 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

Functions can also be defined in highly abstract or "wacky" ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. For example, `h(a)` could be defined as the next largest number that starts with the same letter as variable `a`, assuming English number names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   `h(2)`: Since '2' starts with 'T', the next largest number starting with 'T' is 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   `h(8)`: Since '8' starts with 'E', the next largest number starting with 'E' is 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. This demonstrates the very general nature of functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## Functions in Familiar Equations

Many familiar equations are, in fact, functions. For example, `y = x + 1` can be viewed as a function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This can be written as `y = f(x) = x + 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

We can use [[visualization_techniques_in_solving_equations | visualization techniques in solving equations]] through tables to represent such functions:

| x (Input) | y (Output) |
| :-------- | :--------- |
| 0         | 1          |
| 2         | 3          |
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>

Using function notation (e.g., `f(x) = x + 1`) clarifies that the function takes an input (`x`), processes it (adds 1), and produces an output (1 more than the input) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## What is Not a Function?

A relationship is not a function if a single input can produce more than one possible output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

### Visual Representation of Circles

A common example of a relationship that is not a function is a circle. Consider a circle centered at the origin with a radius of 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   The [[properties_of_a_circle | properties of a circle]] define its equation as `x² + y² = r²` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   For this specific circle, the equation is `x² + y² = 2²`, or `x² + y² = 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

Visually, using [[graphical_representation_of_solutions | graphical representation of solutions]], we can determine if this relationship is a function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>:
*   If we pick an `x` value, such as `x = 1`, there are two corresponding `y` values on the circle: one positive and one negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   Solving the equation for `x = 1`: `1² + y² = 4` leads to `y² = 3`, meaning `y = √3` or `y = -√3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

This demonstrates that for a single input (`x=1`), there are two different outputs (`√3` and `-√3`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Therefore, this relationship is not a function because a function can only have one output for a given input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

A "radical" is another term for the square root symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. When simplifying radicals, the goal is often to extract perfect square factors from beneath the radical sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## What is a Perfect Square?

A perfect square is a number that is the result of squaring an integer (multiplying an integer by itself) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. For example, 36 is a perfect square because it is 6 times 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Examples of Perfect Squares

Common perfect squares include:
*   1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>
*   4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>
*   9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>
*   16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>
*   25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>
*   36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>
*   49 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>
*   64 <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>

## Identifying Perfect Squares in Radical Simplification

When simplifying a radical, the key strategy is to find the largest factor of the number under the radical sign that is a perfect square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

### Steps for Identification
1.  **Factorization**: Consider the factors of the number inside the radical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
2.  **Look for Perfect Square Factors**: Determine if any of these factors are perfect squares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
3.  **Extract**: If a perfect square factor is found, take its square root and move it outside the radical sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

### Example: Simplifying $\sqrt{72}$
*   72 can be factored as 36 × 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   36 is a perfect square (6 × 6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   Therefore, $\sqrt{72} = \sqrt{36 \times 2} = \sqrt{36} \times \sqrt{2} = 6\sqrt{2}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### Example: Simplifying $\sqrt{50}$
*   50 can be factored as 25 × 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   25 is the largest perfect square factor of 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   Thus, $\sqrt{50} = \sqrt{25 \times 2} = \sqrt{25} \times \sqrt{2} = 5\sqrt{2}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
    *   Choosing factors like 5 and 10 would not simplify the radical because neither 5 nor 10 are perfect squares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

### Working with Larger Numbers
For larger numbers, it's possible to identify perfect square factors in multiple steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
For instance, to simplify $7\sqrt{320}$:
1.  Identify a perfect square factor of 320. One might initially see that 16 goes into 320 (320 = 16 × 20) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
2.  Extract the square root of 16: $7\sqrt{16 \times 20} = 7 \times \sqrt{16} \times \sqrt{20} = 7 \times 4 \times \sqrt{20} = 28\sqrt{20}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
3.  Continue to look for perfect square factors in the remaining radical. 20 is equal to 4 × 5, and 4 is a perfect square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
4.  Extract the square root of 4: $28\sqrt{4 \times 5} = 28 \times \sqrt{4} \times \sqrt{5} = 28 \times 2 \times \sqrt{5} = 56\sqrt{5}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
The process continues until the number remaining under the radical can no longer be divided by a perfect square (other than 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

### Recognizing Perfect Squares
There isn't a single "mechanical" way to recognize perfect squares; it often comes with practice and familiarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Regularly working with these numbers helps in more readily identifying them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. If any of the perfect square numbers (e.g., 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64) are a factor of the number under the radical, they should be factored out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

> [!INFO] Connection to Exponent Rules
> Simplifying radicals is an extension of exponent rules. The square root of a number is equivalent to raising that number to the 1/2 power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. For example, $\sqrt{36 \times 2}$ is the same as $(36 \times 2)^{1/2}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. According to exponent rules, this can be written as $36^{1/2} \times 2^{1/2}$, which is $\sqrt{36} \times \sqrt{2}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This demonstrates that radical simplification is not a new concept, but rather an application of existing exponent principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

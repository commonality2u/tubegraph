A linear equation can be represented in an infinite number of ways through algebraic manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. For example, the equation `y = 2x + 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a> can also be written as `-2x + y = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a> or `y - 5 = 2(x - 1)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. All these forms are algebraically equivalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

However, one particularly useful representation for understanding the [[properties of slope in linear equations | properties]] of a linear equation is the **slope-intercept form** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Slope-Intercept Form

The slope-intercept form of a linear equation is `y = mx + b` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>, where:
*   `y` and `x` are the variables.
*   `m` represents the [[understanding slope as rate of change | slope]] of the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
*   `b` represents the y-intercept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

This form is named "slope-intercept form" because it makes it very easy to determine both the slope and the y-intercept of the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

### Identifying the Y-Intercept

To find the y-intercept, set `x = 0` in the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
Consider the example `y = 2x + 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>:
*   If `x = 0`, then `y = 2(0) + 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   This simplifies to `y = 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   So, the y-intercept is the point `(0, 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This is the point where the line crosses the y-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. In the slope-intercept form `y = mx + b`, the value of `b` directly gives the y-coordinate of the y-intercept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

### [[finding the slope of a line | Determining Slope]]

The slope `m` in the equation `y = mx + b` represents the [[understanding slope as rate of change | rate of change]] of `y` with respect to `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. It is the ratio of the change in `y` (delta y) to the change in `x` (delta x): `slope = Δy / Δx` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

Let's use the equation `y = 2x + 3` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a> to demonstrate [[finding the slope of a line using two points | slope calculation]]:
1.  We found the point `(0, 3)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
2.  Let's find another point by increasing `x` by 1 (`Δx = 1`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>:
    *   If `x = 1`, then `y = 2(1) + 3 = 5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
    *   The new point is `(1, 5)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
    *   The change in `y` (`Δy`) from `(0, 3)` to `(1, 5)` is `5 - 3 = 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
    *   The [[finding the slope of a line | slope]] is `Δy / Δx = 2 / 1 = 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

This pattern holds true for any change in `x`:
*   If `x = 2`, then `y = 2(2) + 3 = 7` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   From `(1, 5)` to `(2, 7)`, `Δx = 1` and `Δy = 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. The [[finding the slope of a line | slope]] remains `2 / 1 = 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

When an equation is in slope-intercept form (`y = mx + b`), the coefficient of `x` (`m`) directly represents the [[finding the slope of a line | slope]] of the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

### Example: Graphing from Slope-Intercept Form

Let's consider `y = -x + 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>:
*   **Y-intercept**: The `b` value is `2`, so the y-intercept is `(0, 2)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   **Slope**: The coefficient of `x` is `-1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. This means for every increase of 1 in `x`, `y` will decrease by 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> [[understanding slope of a straight line | Slope of a line in algebra]] is defined as the change in `y` divided by the change in `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. [[graph interpretation for slope calculation | Graphing a linear equation]] from its slope-intercept form is often the easiest method for visualizing the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. This form is particularly useful for [[plotting distance versus time and slope interpretation | interpreting the slope as a rate of change]].

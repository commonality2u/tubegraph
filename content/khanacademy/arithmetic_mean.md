The [[calculating_the_mean|arithmetic mean]] is the most common type of average people refer to in everyday language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. It is one of several [[central_tendency|measures of central tendency]] used in statistics to describe data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## Understanding Data with Statistics

Statistics is a field focused on understanding and interpreting data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. A key area is [[descriptive_statistics|descriptive statistics]], which aims to summarize a large set of data using a smaller set of numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This allows for a simplified description without needing to present all the raw data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Once descriptive statistics are understood, inferential statistics can be used to draw conclusions and make judgments about the data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

A common question in descriptive statistics is how to represent a dataset with a single, typical number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This search for a "typical number," a "middle number," the "most frequent number," or a "center" leads to the concept of an average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. In statistics, "average" is a more general term for a measure of [[central_tendency|central tendency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## Defining and Calculating the Arithmetic Mean

The [[calculating_the_mean|arithmetic mean]] is a human-constructed definition that has proven useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. It is calculated by summing all the numbers in a dataset and then dividing that sum by the total count of numbers in the dataset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

### Example Calculation

Consider a dataset representing the heights of six plants in inches: 4, 3, 1, 6, 1, 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

To find the [[calculating_the_mean|arithmetic mean]]:
1.  **Sum the numbers**: 4 + 3 + 1 + 6 + 1 + 7 = 22 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
2.  **Count the numbers**: There are 6 data points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
3.  **Divide the sum by the count**: 22 / 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

The arithmetic mean is 3 and 4/6, which simplifies to 3 and 2/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. This can also be expressed as a repeating decimal, 3.666... (or 3.6 repeating) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

## Other Measures of Central Tendency

While the [[calculating_the_mean|arithmetic mean]] is widely used, other measures like the [[median]] and mode also describe the [[central_tendency|center]] or typical value of a dataset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

*   The [[median]] is the middle number in an ordered dataset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. If there's an even number of data points, it's the [[calculating_the_mean|arithmetic mean]] of the two middle numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
*   The mode is the most frequently occurring number in a dataset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. A dataset might not have a mode if all numbers appear with equal frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

Each of these measures offers a different perspective on the "average" and is suitable for different types of data analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. The [[median]] is particularly useful when a dataset contains extreme values that could "skew" the [[calculating_the_mean|arithmetic mean]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

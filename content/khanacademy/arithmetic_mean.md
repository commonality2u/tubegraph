Statistics is a field dedicated to understanding and interpreting data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. A significant part of statistics involves [[descriptive_statistics | descriptive statistics]], which aims to summarize large datasets with a smaller set of numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This allows for describing the data without presenting every single data point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Describing Data with a Single Number

When faced with a set of data, like the heights of six plants (4, 3, 1, 6, 1, 7 inches) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>, one might want to represent all these numbers with a single, typical value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. This representative number is often sought to describe the "middle" or "center" of the data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. This concept is broadly referred to as an "average" in statistics, which is an attempt to find a measure of [[central_tendency_in_statistics | central tendency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.

There are multiple types of averages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>, including the [[mean_in_statistics | mean]], [[median | median]], and [[mean_median_and_mode | mode]].

## What is the Arithmetic Mean?

The **arithmetic mean** is the most common type of average in everyday terminology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. It is defined as the sum of all numbers in a dataset divided by the total number of numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. This definition is a human-constructed concept that has proven useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>.

### Calculating the Arithmetic Mean

To calculate the arithmetic mean for a given data set:
1.  Sum all the numbers in the set.
2.  Divide the sum by the count of numbers in the set.

**Example: Plant Heights**
Consider the plant height data: 4, 3, 1, 6, 1, 7 inches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>.

1.  **Sum of numbers**: 4 + 3 + 1 + 6 + 1 + 7 = 22 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>
2.  **Number of data points**: There are 6 plants, so 6 data points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.
3.  **Arithmetic Mean**: 22 / 6 = 3 and 4/6 = 3 and 2/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>.

This can also be expressed as a repeating decimal, 3.6 repeating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>. This value, 3 and 2/3, is considered a representative number and a measure of the central tendency for this dataset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>.

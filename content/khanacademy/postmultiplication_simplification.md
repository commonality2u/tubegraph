When [[multiplying_fractions | multiplying fractions]], the result often needs to be simplified to its lowest terms. This process is known as postmultiplication simplification, as it occurs *after* the initial multiplication has been completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Steps for Postmultiplication Simplification

1.  **Multiply the fractions**: To [[multiplying_fractions | multiply two fractions]], the new numerator is the product of the original numerators, and the new denominator is the product of the original denominators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
    *   For example, to multiply 5/6 by 2/3:
        *   Multiply numerators: 5 x 2 = 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>
        *   Multiply denominators: 6 x 3 = 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>
        *   The product is 10/18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

2.  **Identify Common Factors**: After finding the product, examine the new numerator and denominator for any common factors greater than 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
    *   In the example of 10/18, both numbers are divisible by 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

3.  **Divide by Common Factors**: To express the fraction in its [[simplifying_fractional_representations | lowest terms]], divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
    *   For 10/18:
        *   10 รท 2 = 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>
        *   18 รท 2 = 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>
        *   The simplified answer is 5/9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Alternative: Premultiplication Simplification

While simplifying after multiplication is effective, it is also possible to [[premultiplication_simplification | simplify the fractions *before* multiplying]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This can often make the numbers smaller and easier to work with.

For example, with 5/6 times 2/3:
*   Identify common factors between any numerator and any denominator. Here, the '2' in the numerator of 2/3 and the '6' in the denominator of 5/6 share a common factor of 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   Divide 2 by 2 to get 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   Divide 6 by 2 to get 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   The expression becomes 5/3 times 1/3.
*   Now, [[multiplying_fractions | multiply]] the new numbers: 5 x 1 = 5, and 3 x 3 = 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   The result is 5/9, the same answer obtained through postmultiplication simplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

Both methods lead to the same correct answer, but [[premultiplication_simplification | premultiplication simplification]] can sometimes make it easier to recognize common factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

Area is a fundamental concept in geometry that measures the extent of a two-dimensional surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. It quantifies how much space a figure occupies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. For an [[introduction_to_area | Introduction to area]], one common way to conceptualize area is by determining how many 1-by-1 squares can fit within a given figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. A 1-by-1 square is a square with sides of length 1 unit each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

Area is often contrasted with [[calculating_perimeter_of_rectangles_and_squares | perimeter]], which is the distance around the outside of a shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Calculating Area of Rectangles

A rectangle is a four-sided figure with four right angles, where opposite sides are equal in length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

To find the area of a rectangle, you can multiply one dimension (often called length or width) by the other dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. The result tells you how many 1-by-1 squares fit inside the rectangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

### Example: 7 by 5 Rectangle

Consider a rectangle named ABCD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   Side AB is 7 units long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   Side BC is 5 units long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

To calculate the area, you would multiply these two dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>:
Area of ABCD = Length × Width <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>
Area of ABCD = 7 × 5 = 35 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>

This means you can fit 35 1-by-1 squares within this rectangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

### Example: Rectangle with Fractional Dimensions

The same principle applies to rectangles with fractional dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
If a rectangle has dimensions of 1/2 by 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>:
Area = 1/2 × 2 = 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>

This means that even with fractional dimensions, the total space covered is equivalent to one whole 1-by-1 square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

## Calculating Area of Squares

A square is a special type of rectangle where all four sides are equal in length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a> and it has four right angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

To find the area of a square, you can multiply the length of one side by itself, which is also known as "squaring" the side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. This is why the mathematical operation of raising a number to the power of two is called "squaring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. For more information, see [[calculating_area_of_squares | Calculating area of squares]].

### Example: 2 by 2 Square

Consider a square named XYZS where one side, XS, is 2 units long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Since it's a square, all sides are 2 units long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
Area of XYZS = Side × Side
Area of XYZS = 2 × 2 = 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>

You can visually confirm this by fitting four 1-by-1 squares onto a 2-by-2 square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

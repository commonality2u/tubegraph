Algebra serves as a fundamental language for understanding the universe and has widespread applications across various fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. According to Galileo Galilei, philosophy is written in the "mathematical language," without which one wanders through a "dark labyrinth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. This highlights [[the_fundamental_role_of_algebra_in_mathematics | the fundamental role of algebra in mathematics]] and mathematics in general, as it allows for [[the_abstraction_and_generalization_in_algebra | abstraction]] and the explanation of how the universe is structured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>.

## Core Purpose of Algebra

The true essence of algebra lies in its ability to abstract concepts, enabling the study of core ideas that explain the structure of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. These abstract ideas are more fundamental and pure than any single application, even when applied to specific domains like economics, finance, physics, or chemistry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>. [[Philosophical perspectives on mathematics and algebra | Philosophical perspectives on mathematics and algebra]] emphasize that mathematics, particularly algebra, serves as a universal language, potentially acting as a common ground for communication with alien life forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>.

## Everyday Applications: Calculating Discounts

Algebra provides a way to generalize calculations beyond specific instances. Consider calculating a discount at a store:
*   **Specific Calculation**
    A 30% discount on a $20 pair of pants is calculated by multiplying 30% (or 0.30) by $20, resulting in a $6 discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.
*   **Generalizing for Any Product Price**
    By introducing a variable, `x`, to represent the non-discount price of any product, the discount can be expressed as:
    `Discount = 0.30 * x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>
    This allows one to find the discount for any product price by simply substituting the value for `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.
*   **Generalizing for Any Percentage Off and Product Price**
    To further generalize, another variable, `p`, can be introduced to represent the percentage off (as a decimal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>. The general equation for discount becomes:
    `Discount = p * x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>
    Or, using `y` for discount:
    `y = p * x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>
    This equation allows for calculating a discount for any given percentage off and any product price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>. This demonstrates [[understanding_relationships_and_equations_in_algebra | understanding relationships and equations in algebra]].

## Scientific Applications: Physics

The abstract relationships in algebra apply universally, regardless of the specific context. For instance, the general equation `y = p * x` is fundamentally the same as Newton's second law of motion:
`Force = Mass * Acceleration` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>

In this context:
*   `y` (discount) can represent `Force` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>
*   `p` (percentage off) can represent `Mass` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>
*   `x` (product price) can represent `Acceleration` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>

Thus, `F = m * a` is the "same exact idea" as `y = p * x`, demonstrating how a single algebraic structure underlies different phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>.

## Wide-Ranging Impact of Algebraic Abstraction

The power of algebra lies in its ability to allow manipulation of abstract relationships, leading to discoveries that can be reapplied across countless fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>. This includes:
*   Economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>
*   Finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>
*   Computer Science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>
*   Logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>
*   Electrical Engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>
*   Accounting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>

For example, if an algebraic relationship `y = p * x` is known, then through [[performing_legitimate_algebraic_operations | performing legitimate algebraic operations]], it can be deduced that `y / x = p` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>. This derived relationship holds true and has implications for every field where the initial equation applies, revealing fundamental truths about the universe itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>. Many applications of algebra remain undiscovered, waiting to be found in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>.

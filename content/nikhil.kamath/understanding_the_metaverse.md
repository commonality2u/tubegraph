The [[metaverse]] has become a significant topic, especially after Facebook rebranded to Meta, signaling a bold step into this new digital frontier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>. While there is still confusion surrounding its precise [[defining_the_metaverse | definition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>, discussions suggest that the "metaversal habit" is already present in our daily lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>.

## [[Defining the Metaverse]]

Defining the [[metaverse]] can be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>. One perspective is that we already "disappear into a different universe" based on our tastes, such as Instagram for lifestyle content or social networks like Koo or Twitter for thoughts and opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>. These existing digital spaces are essentially "universes" that we log into <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>. The more immersive an experience becomes, the more it aligns with the concept of the [[metaverse]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>.

Marcus, founder and CEO of Another One, defines the [[metaverse]] as an ecosystem, physical or digital, that creates a complex set of rules, connections, and interlinks between people, independent of specific physical locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>. He likens it to old board games like Dungeons & Dragons, where imagination served as the primary sense for perceiving the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>.

Another definition describes it as "a network of interconnected 3D spaces" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a>. The [[metaverse]] aims to digitize human senses into a virtual world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>, already encompassing sight, hearing, and increasingly touch through haptics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a>.

## [[Origins of the Term Metaverse]]

The term "metaverse" is a made-up word <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>. It originated 20-30 years ago from a novelist who described a version of it in a book called *Snow Crash* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>. This concept was further popularized by movies like *Ready Player One* and *The Matrix*, where characters are plugged into a virtual world via a device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>.

## [[Current Understanding and Experiences of the Metaverse]]

Currently, logging into a phone is considered a universe in itself, with each app representing a distinct universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>. The widespread use of smartphones, with daily screen times averaging around 10 hours, suggests that a form of metaversal experience is already ingrained in our lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.

Virtual reality (VR) devices like [[Oculus]] provide moments that feel "pretty amazing" and hint at the potential for more immersive experiences in fitness, music, and other areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>. One popular application is VR Chat, an online chat room where users can interact, play games, and engage in creative activities in a virtual environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>.

Examples of existing immersive experiences include:
*   **Grand Theft Auto (GTA) Role Play**: A multiplayer version of GTA V where thousands of users can join servers, choose occupations, start businesses, and role-play characters in a virtual city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>. This environment fosters genuine social interactions and storytelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>.
*   **Counter-Strike Skins**: The behavior of purchasing virtual items, such as expensive gun "skins" in games like Counter-Strike, demonstrates a willingness to spend on digital signaling in virtual worlds where people spend significant time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:15">[00:51:15]</a>.
*   **Virtual Tourism/Shopping**: Use cases like virtual tourism or shopping may require full immersion, allowing users to experience places and interact with products as if they were physically present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a>.

## [[Role of Technology in the Metaverse]]

The [[metaverse]]'s evolution is heavily reliant on technological advancements:

*   **Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR)**: VR headsets like [[Oculus]] offer immersive experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>. While current VR devices can be bulky and cause physical discomfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:02">[00:52:02]</a>, smaller, lighter forms like clip-on glasses are emerging, indicating progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>.
*   **5G Connectivity**: 5G is critical for streaming high-quality virtual experiences to lightweight devices. It will allow the processing, GPU, and battery to be separated from the display, making headsets lighter and more comfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:36">[00:53:36]</a>.
*   **Compute Power and Moore's Law**: The decreasing cost and increasing power of computing (Moore's Law) are essential for democratizing access to immersive 3D experiences. High-fidelity experiences require immense backend compute, which needs to become more affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>.
*   **Game Engines**: Game engines like Unreal Engine are pivotal in building and defining the [[metaverse]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>. John Carmack, a legendary game designer, built the first game engine, which redefined immersion and led to engines like Unreal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:13">[00:35:13]</a>. Unreal Engine provides tools like "metahumans" that generate incredibly realistic human avatars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>.
*   **Blockchain and NFTs**: Some definitions of the [[metaverse]] emphasize the use of blockchain technology for traceability and ownership of digital assets, such as virtual land (NFTs) in platforms like Sandbox and Decentraland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>. However, integrating high-quality graphics with blockchain-traced transactions is currently a technological challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:16">[00:40:16]</a>.
*   **[[Artificial Intelligence and Metaverse | Artificial Intelligence (AI)]]**: AI is expected to play a significant role, with tools like Nerf (Neural Radiance Field) allowing smartphones to capture real-world rooms and create 3D versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:33">[01:07:33]</a>. AI can leverage data to provide tailored experiences and insights, especially in fields like medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:50">[01:08:50]</a>.

### Virtual Influencers

Virtual influencers like India's first, Kyra, are a new phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:46">[00:56:46]</a>. Kyra is a 3D-created character that exists in the digital world, with a curated story and voice actress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:13">[00:59:13]</a>. Brands like MG Motors have utilized Kyra for campaigns, indicating a shift where virtual entities can replace human influencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:23">[01:00:23]</a>. The appeal of virtual influencers lies in character and storytelling, similar to fictional characters like Harry Potter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:30">[01:01:30]</a>.

## [[Technology Adoption and the Future of the Metaverse]]

The [[metaverse]]'s adoption is compared to the evolution of the internet, progressing from basic chat rooms to gaming and more complex applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:20">[00:37:20]</a>. The barrier to becoming a "rock star" (influencer or content creator) has continuously lowered over decades, from YouTube to short video apps like TikTok and Josh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:09">[01:01:09]</a>. The next step is to further reduce this barrier in the [[metaverse]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:13">[01:01:13]</a>.

The [[metaverse]] also presents a "digital twin" concept, where real-world objects and environments have virtual counterparts, potentially leveraging AI and advanced capture tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:22">[01:07:22]</a>.

Companies to watch in the [[metaverse]] space include Microsoft, which is considered a leader in the enterprise sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:45">[00:46:45]</a>, and Nvidia, an infrastructure player that manufactures hardware essential for powering the [[metaverse]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:23">[00:47:23]</a>. Apple's anticipated VR devices are also expected to significantly impact the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:57">[00:47:57]</a>.

Despite the excitement, the future of the [[metaverse]] is not without challenges. While some companies are building on blockchain, others like Meta operate on centralized servers. A key difference is the economic model: decentralized metaverses might offer creators a higher share of revenue (e.g., 85% royalty in Sandbox) compared to centralized platforms that take a larger cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:35">[00:49:35]</a>.

The development of the [[metaverse]] will consume significant energy, but its long-term benefits in reducing physical travel and resource consumption for interactions could make it a "Greener solution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:04">[01:10:04]</a>.

Ultimately, while the [[metaverse]] promises immersive experiences and conveniences across various domains like healthcare, finance, and travel, it is debated whether it will fully replace human interaction in the physical world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:11">[01:13:11]</a>.

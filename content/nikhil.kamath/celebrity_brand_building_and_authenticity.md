Effective brand building for entrepreneurs, especially young ones, often involves cultivating a desirable image to attract funding and interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. For celebrities, this translates into managing public perception and personal narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## Public Image vs. Authentic Self
Celebrities often find themselves in a position where the media is more interested in their personal lives than their professional work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This has led many film personalities to realize that interviews are not the best way to promote a film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Instead, interviews are preferred when there is something inspiring to say or experiences to share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

A common challenge for Indian celebrities is their tendency to shy away from being vocal about their true selves, often presenting a "media trained facet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>. This approach may have worked previously, but today, audiences are increasingly drawn to a person's flaws and vulnerabilities, not just a perfected image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:45">[00:31:45]</a>.

### The Role of Mystery and Social Media
One perspective suggests that maintaining a "mysterious aura" can be beneficial for a film actor, as constant social media presence might lead to audiences getting bored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56">[00:31:56]</a>. However, there's also the question of whether an audience would prefer a "vanilla version" of a celebrity's controlled narrative or if they would rather the media create a more sensationalized perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>.

The belief is that if a celebrity's real version, including flaws and vulnerabilities, is depicted organically, it could lead to stronger connection with the audience, potentially benefiting endeavors such as launching a brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:44">[00:32:44]</a>.

## [[Influencerled branding | Celebrity-Led Branding]]
When considering a [[Building a fashion beauty or home brand | lifestyle brand]], there's a fear of launching a "celebrity brand which tried and failed," given the many examples of such failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>. Success in this area is exemplified by successful entrepreneurs like the guest's wife, who demonstrated "marketing genius" with her children's wear brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:55">[00:30:55]</a>.

The challenge in brand building, particularly in India, lies in understanding the market and addressing the lack of prominent domestic brands like Zara or H&M, despite a large consumer base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>. The focus is on creating "Essentials" like quality white t-shirts, jeans, and shirts, alongside sneakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>.

The discussion touches upon the importance of [[Authenticity in building a personal brand or story | authenticity]] in building a public image, with the host emphasizing that people connect with flaws and vulnerabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:45">[00:31:45]</a>. This suggests that a genuine portrayal of self, rather than a carefully curated "proper image," is more likely to resonate with the public and lead to deeper engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a>.
The concept of "giving" in terms of attention and self is highlighted as a key trait of a celebrity like Shah Rukh Khan, fostering a deep connection with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:56">[01:29:56]</a>. This aligns with the idea that genuine engagement, even without a perfectly polished image, can be powerful.

Ultimately, the goal for a celebrity is to inspire people and share experiences rather than just discuss personal achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This approach contributes to a more meaningful and lasting brand, focusing on [[The role of brands in influencing | inspiring]] and connecting rather than merely promoting.

YouTube's CEO, Neal Mohan, has stated that YouTube does not consider itself social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Instead, the platform's role is to "build the stage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a> and ensure it is "the best possible stage in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

Cultural and family backgrounds significantly shape an individual's career path, influencing aspirations, choices, and resilience in pursuing unconventional professions. This influence can range from direct parental guidance and expectations to ingrained values and observed societal norms.

## Parental Influence and Upbringing

Early [[Family influences and personal experiences | family influences]] often set the initial trajectory for career perceptions. Kriti Sanon, for instance, describes herself as a "shy, studious, and nerdy kid" who felt the "firstborn pressure" to excel in studies [00:05:34]. Her mother, a professor, and father, a CA, instilled a strong emphasis on achieving high grades, particularly around the "90% sent" mark [00:05:48]. This competitive drive came from her mother's own life, who, as the "first woman who started working in her sort of family," fought for her PhD against traditional expectations of marriage [01:10:53]. This maternal ambition translated into constant encouragement and even structured "math tests" at home to improve Kriti's academic performance [00:09:32]. Although initially disliking classical dance, Kriti's mother "dragged" her to Kathak classes at age five, recognizing her talent and desiring to make it a skill, which later provided a foundational "rhythm and grace" beneficial for her acting career [00:06:57, 00:07:44, 00:08:32].

Rahul, a cricketer, also highlights a similar dynamic. His parents, both professors (his dad taught geology, his mom Indian history), were "very strict about education" [00:57:49, 01:14:56]. They permitted him to pursue cricket on the condition that his grades did not drop [01:14:59]. His father, who had to "give it up" playing cricket in his youth due to parental disapproval, was supportive of Rahul's passion, demonstrating how parents can project their unfulfilled dreams onto their children [01:14:37].

Badshah's [[Family influences and personal experiences | family influences]] also reveal a similar academic leaning. Born in Delhi, his father worked for the government electricity board, and his mother was a teacher [01:44:24]. He also pursued engineering, going to Punjab Engineering College [01:45:23]. This highlights a common thread among individuals pursuing [[The Pursuit of Nontraditional Careers and Making It | nontraditional careers]] where a strong academic background or a "Plan B" is often expected or encouraged by parents from traditional professions [01:15:15].

## The Pursuit of Unconventional Careers

Despite these conventional academic upbringings, all three individuals ventured into [[The Pursuit of Nontraditional Careers and Making It | unconventional careers]]. For Kriti, the journey into acting was unexpected; she "didn't really know what I wanted to do in life" until engineering [00:15:20]. She found her "passion" through trial and error, realizing she enjoyed acting during a TV commercial shoot after initially struggling with confidence in modeling and ramp walks [01:53:56]. Her mother's initial protective advice, citing the need to be "thick skinned" and resilient like Priyanka Chopra, underscores the perceived challenges of the acting world [01:55:31]. Kriti's ability to [[Personal challenges and resilience in career | overcome stage fright]] and gain confidence "with work" by putting herself in "situations that you're scared of" reflects her intrinsic drive that transcended her initial shyness [00:06:03, 01:41:47, 01:41:50].

Rahul's love for cricket began at a young age, picking up a bat at "2 and a half 3 years old" [00:58:47]. His persistence led his father to finally enroll him in a cricket camp at age 11, a decision that made a "crazy big difference" [01:13:17, 01:13:20]. He believes in inherent "talent" in sports, a natural ability to judge the ball, coordinate, and react, which he argues "can't be taught" or fully acquired if not present at birth [01:03:10, 01:05:32]. However, he also credits playing multiple sports for his overall athletic development [00:59:37].

Badshah, similarly, found his path in music organically. He "started writing" as a way to express himself because he "couldn't Express" verbally, a habit that began in school [02:01:34]. His exposure to rap music through a friend's brother further shaped his interests [01:45:49]. He emphasizes the "want" and "passion" as prerequisites for success in music, asserting that if these are present, "it's only a matter of time" before one succeeds, echoing Jay-Z's quote about persistence [02:13:14, 02:13:41].

## [[Generational Choices and Conformity]] and Society's Expectations

The narrative reveals a broader societal pattern where parents often expect children to follow traditional career paths, often due to a lack of understanding or perceived instability in [[Parental perception of gaming careers | unconventional careers]]. Kriti notes that while her parents were supportive, her mother's concerns stemmed from her own experiences of limited opportunities [01:12:05]. She acknowledges being an "outsider" in the film industry, navigating it without a "legacy" or established connections, which sometimes meant making career choices that prioritized exposure over personal fulfillment [01:19:10, 02:37:37].

Rahul's observation that "at least in cricket I don't think there's your your legacy or where you come from what your parents did really matter that much" suggests a meritocracy in sports compared to other fields [01:14:16]. However, the constant societal and internal pressure to succeed in a competitive environment like cricket leads to moments of self-doubt and anxiety, particularly as one ages [02:16:15]. Rahul's strategy to [[Overcoming challenges in offbeat careers | deal with pressure]] and anxiety is to focus on the joy of the sport rather than the outcome, and to remind himself of his humble beginnings [01:22:56]. He also notes the increasing difficulty of dealing with "trolling" as one becomes more public, resorting to disengaging from social media [01:27:27, 01:32:46].

## [[Relationships and Family Dynamics]] and Personal Fulfillment

The role of [[Relationships and Family Dynamics | relationships and family dynamics]] extends beyond career choice to personal well-being. Rahul emphasizes the importance of a supportive partner, describing his wife, Athiya, as his "safe space" and "escape" who keeps him "grounded" [02:31:32]. This stability helps him stay "focused" and reduces the "mind wave" that occurred when he was single [02:32:06]. Kriti, while attached to her family, is less dependent on daily contact when immersed in work, and initially views financial decisions as collective rather than purely individual, highlighting her strong family ties [01:28:14, 02:09:05]. Badshah, on the other hand, believes a partner is important for feeling "whole as an individual," but questions the "need to tie what is a wonderful thing with a societal construct with a bunch of rules" [02:31:07, 02:33:57].

Ultimately, the journey through unconventional careers reveals a blend of innate talent, personal drive, and the profound, often complex, influence of family and cultural expectations. The ability to embrace [[Personal challenges and resilience in career | continuous learning]] and adaptation, and to find personal peace amidst professional demands, are highlighted as crucial for sustained success.

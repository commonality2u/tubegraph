## Early Life and Upbringing
The speaker, born in Shimoga, Karnataka, spent his early [[childhood_experiences | childhood experiences]] moving frequently due to his father's transfers working for Canara Bank, living in places like Shimoga, Hassen (Karnataka), and Karnal (Haryana) for three years [00:04:54]. He still has friends from Karnal [00:05:11]. From age seven until 37, he was primarily a "Bangalore boy," a city he has immense love for and feels has given him everything [00:05:46]. He believes Bangalore has a unique soul compared to Mumbai [00:06:33].

He was born to actors Rishi Kapoor and Neetu Singh, making him a fourth-generation actor in his family [00:06:43]. Growing up in a privileged household, he attended Bombay Scottish School [00:06:55]. He was not proficient in academics, realizing early that acting did not require strong study habits [00:07:01]. While he never explicitly decided to become an actor, growing up as a "star kid" brought attention, which he initially enjoyed [00:07:16]. Despite his family background, he was not favored in school, often getting "beaten up" by teachers and the principal [00:07:57]. He recounts crawling out of class and facing more scrutiny as a "celebrity kid" who might go "out of control" [00:08:01].

He considered himself an introvert [00:07:42]. Football was his main strength, giving him a sense of purpose and achievement, as he felt "below average in everything else" [00:07:45]. After school, he attended HR College in Mumbai but spent most of his time at a bowling alley [00:09:49]. He scored 54.3% on his 10th-standard boards, a result that brought immense happiness to his family, who, having multiple dropouts, considered it a "genius" achievement [00:08:37].

## Parental Influence
The speaker's [[family_influences_on_personal_development | family influences on personal development]] were significant. His father was a "short-tempered man" but a "very good man" who loved his family, work, food, and alcohol [01:10:02]. He was an "open person" who spoke his mind [01:12:47]. However, the speaker admits he "never saw his eye color" until he was 10, always saying "yes" and being "scared" of him [01:12:53]. His father never physically abused them, but his "volatile" temperament created fear [01:13:06].

His parents experienced many "shitloads of fights" during his [[childhood_experiences | childhood experiences]], which he often heard while sitting on the stairs [01:13:20]. These experiences left him "always a little um scared" and "on the edge" [01:13:30]. He believes his father's generation of men were "scared of vulnerability" and struggled to express love physically [01:14:31]. Despite this, he "knew he loved me a lot" [01:14:52].

His father kept him on a "very tight budget" while he studied in New York, limiting him to a $2 McDonald's meal for lunch and dinner [01:12:24]. Upon returning to Mumbai, his father took away his car and provided no pocket money, aiming to "school" him and expose him to "hardship" rather than a "moisturized" life [01:11:27]. The speaker wonders if these actions were for his benefit or to "show that they are doing it" [01:12:17].

He attributes his own struggle with expressing himself and crying to his [[childhood_experiences | childhood experiences]] [01:13:37]. He didn't cry when his father passed away, experiencing a panic attack instead, and feels he hasn't fully grieved or understood the loss [01:13:59]. He carries guilt for not embracing his father more during his final year of cancer treatment in New York, realizing the "distance" between them [01:14:31]. He felt a responsibility not to show weakness given his mother, sister, wife, and child [01:15:14].

## Sibling Dynamics
The speaker's sister is two years his elder [01:18:50]. They shared a room until he was 13 and she was 15 [01:19:02]. Initially, she would "beat me up" as she was bigger, but he later reciprocated when he grew [01:19:04]. Due to their respective studies and marriage, he "missed out on the good years of bonding" with her [01:19:15]. While she is happily married in Delhi with a 13-year-old daughter, he admits he is "not as close to her as I would like to be" [01:19:24]. He connects this to his inherent [[personal_relationships_and_identity | detachment]] and "avoidant attachment" style, which he believes started at a very young age [01:19:43]. He has a faint memory of feeling immense pain when a childhood friend would leave, possibly leading him to "close up and just detached myself from everybody" [01:20:02].

## Personal Growth and Parenthood
Becoming a father has been a "game changer," making him question his [[personal_relationships_and_identity | detachment]] and indifference [01:20:30]. He feels "reborn" and is experiencing "new kind of emotions" and feelings [01:20:43]. This new experience has even altered his perception of death, now wishing for more years of life to spend with his daughter [01:20:59].

He views his marriage to his wife, Alia, as fortunate because they are "extremely close as a friend" and she is his "best friend" [01:56:02]. He loves her ambition and intelligence [01:57:32]. He acknowledges that she has made more effort to change for him than he has for her, particularly in lowering her voice due to his [[childhood_experiences | childhood experiences]] with his father's loud tone [01:58:04]. He states that his wife's positive relationship with his mother makes him very happy, as they are "very honest with each other" [01:01:09]. He feels surrounded by "the best women in the world" with his mother, sister, sister's daughter, wife, and his own daughter [01:01:22].

## Reflections on Loss and Emotion
The speaker reflects on the challenge of expressing emotions, particularly crying [01:33:37]. He states he didn't cry when his father passed away, attributing it to an inability to express himself and a panic attack [01:34:01]. He also felt a need to remain strong for his family [01:35:14].

He previously tried therapy in London before his father fell ill but found it didn't work, partly because he couldn't "completely honestly express myself" and felt the therapist was teaching him to "manipulate life" [01:35:30]. He was wary of intentionally putting something in motion to avoid stress [01:36:08]. He remains "very scared of opening myself up" [01:36:42].

The interviewer shares his own recent experience with his father's sudden death, expressing immense guilt for not being present and not having done "enough as a son" [01:37:31]. This guilt was amplified by a series of family adversities, including his brother's stroke and sister-in-law's cancer treatment shortly after their father's passing [01:41:01]. He relates this to guilt around things he felt he *could* control but didn't [01:22:24]. His "low point" also included the death of his beloved pet dog, Hobs, an experience that caused profound attachment despite not living with his parents at the time [01:20:01].

He struggles to identify high points as he has a "pessimistic persona" and rehashes his flaws more than his successes [01:22:54]. He is his own "first critic" and finds failures more vivid than successes [01:23:06]. While this is conducive to growth, he questions if it is conducive to mental well-being [01:23:21].

The speaker feels he lives a "life of contradiction," especially in marriage, where one must sacrifice aspects of their personality and adjust [01:25:30]. He believes his ultimate wish would be for his father to return so he could spend more time and have conversations with him [01:26:16]. He now sees his father's traits, like yawning, appearing in himself, though his personality is more like his calm mother's [01:26:34].

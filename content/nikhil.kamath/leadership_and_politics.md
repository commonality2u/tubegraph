This article explores the nature of [[Leadership skills and their application in politics | political leadership]], drawing parallels with [[Politics and Entrepreneurship | entrepreneurship]], examining the qualities required for success in public life, and discussing the role of youth and societal changes in the political landscape.

## Parallels between Politics and Entrepreneurship
The speaker notes that many similarities exist between [[Politics and Entrepreneurship | politics and entrepreneurship]] that have not been widely discussed [00:03:48]. Both fields require a "zero fear" mindset, not being afraid of anything, and taking bold decisions that might not be taken otherwise due to governmental structures [00:01:01].

## Qualities of a Politician
Being a politician and being a successful politician are two distinct things [00:20:58]. Success in politics requires:
*   **Dedication and Commitment** It requires dedication and commitment [00:21:15].
*   **Empathy and Partnership** One must be a partner in people's happiness and sorrow [00:21:25].
*   **Team Player** A good politician must genuinely be a good team player [00:21:30]. Believing oneself to be a "tismar" (a highly capable person who can order everyone around) might lead to winning an election, but it doesn't guarantee being a successful politician [00:21:35].
*   **Mission over Ambition** Individuals should enter politics with a mission, not just ambition [00:23:27]. If a mission-driven person sets out, they will find their place [00:23:30]. The mission itself cultivates capabilities within a person [00:23:39].
*   **Idealism** Idealism is crucial, even more so than ideology [00:36:24]. The freedom movement, for example, was driven by the ideal of independence, though different leaders had different paths to achieve it [00:36:48].
*   **Sensitivity** Politicians need to be sensitive, not "thick-skinned" [00:40:50]. Sensitivity in public life is essential for genuinely serving people [00:40:58].

## Childhood and Early Life Influences
The speaker shared personal experiences from their childhood in Vadnagar, Gujarat, a small town with a population of about 15,000 [00:04:31]. The town, part of the Gaekwad State, emphasized education with facilities like a pond, post office, and library [00:05:01]. The speaker learned swimming in the village pond and attended a charitable high school [00:05:36].

While an average student who avoided competition in studies, the speaker was highly active in other pursuits and quickly grasped new things [00:10:19]. Teachers, like Belji Bhai, recognized potential [00:09:25].

The speaker left home at a very young age and had little contact with childhood friends for many years [00:10:52]. However, upon becoming Chief Minister (CM), a desire arose to reconnect with old classmates, inviting around 30-35 of them to the CM house for a meal [00:11:23]. This was driven by a wish to show that despite gaining power, they remained the same person who left the village years ago [00:11:48].

Another significant act as CM was publicly honoring all teachers, from primary school to high school, inviting around 30-32 of them to a large event with the Governor [00:13:27]. This was to acknowledge their contribution to shaping who they became [00:14:03]. The speaker also hosted family members and individuals who had provided food during their early life [00:14:47].

## [[Challenges and responsibilities in political leadership | Challenges and Responsibilities in Political Leadership]]

### Dealing with Criticism and Public Perception
When asked how they feel about being abused or trolled publicly, the speaker recounted an anecdote about an "Ahmedabadi" man who, after a scooter collision, calmly stated that if someone is "giving" abuse, it doesn't mean he has to "take" it [00:39:09]. This illustrates the philosophy of not internalizing negative criticism and focusing on one's truth [00:40:03].

### Impact of Social Media
Social media, while a source of criticism, also democratizes information, allowing people to verify facts and get closer to the truth, thereby strengthening democracy [00:41:36]. It has fostered a new generation with broad interests, as seen in the youth's engagement with space missions like Chandrayaan and Gaganyaan [00:43:07].

### Managing Anxiety and Emotions
The speaker acknowledges that while they don't experience anxiety in the way many young people today describe it, they have their own challenges [00:44:19]. The speaker's method to manage distress is to "get absorbed in the mission" [00:48:12]. This focus on the mission overrides personal emotions like restlessness or anxiety [00:48:05].

One example shared was the 2002 Godhra incident, which occurred just three days after becoming an MLA [00:48:51]. Despite security concerns and the horrific scene, the focus was on reaching the site and taking action, absorbing personal feelings into the responsibility of the role [00:50:06].

### Learning from Failures and Risk-Taking
Failures are considered essential learning experiences. The speaker cites the example of the Chandrayaan-2 mission, where despite the setback at the last second, they took full responsibility and encouraged the scientists not to be disappointed, instilling confidence for future attempts (which led to Chandrayaan-3's success) [00:54:03].

The speaker's [[Leadership skills and their application in politics | risk-taking ability]] is high, partly because they "don't care at all" about themselves and have "never thought about myself" [01:09:40]. Their life is seen as "one life, one mission" [01:10:28].

## [[Youth involvement in politics | Youth Involvement in Politics]] and [[Political aspirations and involvement | Political Aspirations]]
The speaker encourages [[Youth involvement in politics | youth involvement in politics]], emphasizing that politics is not just about elections, defeat, or power, but a much broader field of public service and policy-making [00:57:59].

> "Politics does not mean elections. Politics doesn't mean defeat. Politics does not mean power; it is its one aspect." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:03">[00:58:03]</a>

A person involved in policy-making can bring about change for the entire country [00:58:48]. The country needs good people to enter politics with a mission [00:23:15].

On the perception that politics is "dirty" or requires money:
*   The speaker dismisses the idea that politics inherently requires money, citing a historical example of a doctor who successfully contested an election by raising one rupee from each person [01:21:03]. Success in politics requires patience and dedication, not transactional contracts [01:22:08].
*   Politics is about social connection and working for the common good, not just winning elections [01:22:32].

### Advice for Aspiring Politicians
*   **Embrace Public Life:** Enter public life in any form; don't limit politics to elections [02:03:57].
*   **Develop [[Leadership skills and their application in politics | Leadership Qualities]]:** Especially for young women, the speaker urges them to develop leadership qualities and prepare for upcoming reservations in legislative bodies [02:03:09].
*   **Focus on Creativity:** The country needs leadership born from creativity and new thinking, not just protests or negative criticism [02:04:09].
*   **Nation First:** The guiding principle should be "Nation First" [00:35:30]. This criterion for decision-making remains constant, even if it means letting go of old ways or adopting new ones [00:35:50].

## Governance and Public Service
The speakerâ€™s governance philosophy is "Minimum Government, Maximum Governance" [01:29:14]. This is not about reducing the number of ministers or employees, but simplifying processes, removing unnecessary compliances, and repealing outdated laws to ease the burden on common citizens [01:30:16].

Technological advancements, such as India Stack, UPI, and direct benefit transfers (DBT) via Jan Dhan accounts, have significantly reduced corruption and democratized access to government services [01:31:22]. This has enhanced India's image globally [01:32:27].

## India's Global Perception
India's perception globally has changed significantly, with many nations now showing respect and trust [01:37:56]. This is attributed to:
*   **Diaspora Strength:** Leveraging the strength of the Indian community spread across the world [01:36:45].
*   **Credibility and Consistency:** India's leadership is seen as credible because it speaks clearly and acts consistently, especially in global crises [01:43:18]. For example, in the Ukraine-Russia conflict, India declared itself "in favor of peace" rather than neutral, earning trust from all sides [01:42:54].
*   **Citizen Welfare:** The commitment to citizens' welfare, even in adverse situations (e.g., bringing back Indians from conflict zones like Ukraine, or providing aid to neighboring countries like Nepal during an earthquake), reinforces global trust [01:43:42].
*   **[[Public perception of politics | Changing Aspirations]]:** The aspirations of Indian youth have shifted from seeking opportunities abroad to building within India [01:38:40]. The increasing desire for development, even in remote areas (e.g., a laborer in Kuwait aspiring for an international airport in his district), reflects a broader national ambition [01:41:34].

## Personal Reflections on Leadership Journey
The speaker emphasizes that their current position was not a result of calculated ambition but rather destiny and a continuous journey of learning and adaptation [01:51:22]. The progression from CM to PM has been marked by an expansion of thinking, increased courage, and grander dreams, focusing on a "Developed India by 2047" [01:57:56]. This vision entails 100% saturation of basic services like toilets, electricity, and tap water, ensuring citizens receive their rights without begging [01:58:24]. True social justice and secularism lie in achieving 100% delivery to 100% beneficiaries without discrimination [01:59:04].

The focus for the future is on preparing a new generation of leaders to handle the country's affairs for the next 20-30 years, considering this a measure of personal and team success [02:00:27].

Nandan, involved in the "India stack Journey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, was tasked by the government to build a unique ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. He chose to make this ID [[adoption_and_impact_of_digital_payments_systems_in_india | digital]] due to his belief in digital technology's transformative power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This approach reflects a long-term perspective, emphasizing building for the "long term" and being "marathon runners" rather than "sprinters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

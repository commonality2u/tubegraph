## Shifting Crime Landscape
Bangalore is experiencing a significant shift from conventional crimes to [[impact_of_technology_on_policing_and_crimesolving | economic, financial, and cybercrimes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>. Conventional crimes, such as property offenses, chain snatchings, and mobile snatchings, are reportedly decreasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:29">[01:17:29]</a>. Currently, approximately 20-25% of crimes are cybercrimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:38">[01:17:38]</a>, with certain divisions like Whitefield and Southeast already seeing this figure rise to 40-45% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:42">[01:17:42]</a>.

Most perpetrators of these crimes are located outside Bangalore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:11">[01:18:11]</a>. Cybercrimes are characterized as "faceless, borderless, anonymous crimes," which contributes to victims lowering their guard, as there is no physical presence to gauge trustworthiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:23">[01:18:23]</a>.

## Common Cybercrime Modalities
Common types of cyber frauds include:
*   Phishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:54">[01:17:54]</a>
*   Digital arrest scams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:58">[01:17:58]</a>
*   FedEx/career frauds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:01">[01:18:01]</a>
*   Investment frauds, such as stock brokerage schemes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:03">[01:18:03]</a>

These criminals employ various methods to defraud individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:08">[01:18:08]</a>, often initiating communication via platforms like WhatsApp or Telegram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:39">[01:18:39]</a>.

## Prevention Tips
To avoid becoming a victim of cybercrime, consider the following:
*   **Do not reply to unsolicited messages** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:46">[01:18:46]</a>.
*   **Avoid sharing personal details** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:57">[01:19:57]</a>.
*   **Never share One-Time Passwords (OTPs)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:20:01]</a>.
*   **Do not click on unknown links** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:04">[01:20:04]</a>.
*   **Be wary of unsolicited advice** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:08">[01:20:08]</a>.
*   **Do not download unknown APK files** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:11">[01:20:11]</a>.
*   **Avoid financial transactions with strangers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:16">[01:20:16]</a>.
*   **Remember that banks do not call for personal information** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:23">[01:20:23]</a>. This is a crucial piece of common sense, as banks explicitly state this on their websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:27">[01:20:27]</a>.
*   **Practice good cyber hygiene**: Be mindful of your privacy settings on social media, as making personal life public can provide opportunities for cyber criminals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:30">[01:19:30]</a>.

## Reporting Cybercrime
If you fall victim to a cybercrime, it is critical to report it immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:55">[01:20:55]</a>.
*   **Dial 1930**: This number allows you to report incidents, particularly financial frauds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:44">[01:20:44]</a>.
*   **Act quickly**: The sooner a complaint is raised, the higher the chance of recovering funds, as the system is integrated with the financial system to stop the flow of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:51">[01:20:51]</a>. This concept is likened to the "golden hour" in traffic accidents, where quick medical attention increases survival rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:14">[01:21:14]</a>.

## The Role of Technology in Prevention
[[impact_of_technology_on_policing_and_crimesolving | Technology]] and social media are aiding in changing public perception and making policing more transparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:57">[01:25:57]</a>. The Bangalore police utilize social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube to communicate directly with the public, building trust and conveying their message without relying solely on mainstream media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>.

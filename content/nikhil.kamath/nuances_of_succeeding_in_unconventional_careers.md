## Kriti Sanon: From Shy Student to Actor
Kriti Sanon described her childhood as that of a "shy and a studious and a nerdy kid," experiencing the typical pressure of a firstborn to excel in academics. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a> Her mother, a professor, and father, a CA, instilled a belief in achieving high grades. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a> Despite her shyness and stage fright, she had an inherent talent for dance, which her mother recognized and nurtured by enrolling her in Kathak classes at age five. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>

Her mother's competitive nature, stemming from her own struggles to pursue education and work in a conservative family, significantly influenced Kriti's drive for perfection. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a> Kriti pursued engineering, not entirely sure of her career path, but found passion in acting later in life. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>

### Overcoming Challenges and Seeking Validation
Kriti candidly shared that her stage fright and shyness were significant hurdles. She would even cry after her first ramp show and photoshoot due to self-consciousness. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a> She gained confidence by consistently putting herself in uncomfortable situations, learning to "surpass that." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>

For Kriti, professional life provides excitement and a sense of being alive, driven by the desire for "amazing scripts with great roles" and collaborations with respected directors. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a> While acknowledging a need for validation, especially as an "outsider" in the industry without a legacy, she emphasizes a shift from proving herself to pushing herself towards roles that truly excite her. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>

Kriti believes in constant learning and asking questions, even when it might initially be perceived negatively. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:44">[00:49:44]</a> She highlights the importance of resilience, not giving up after failures, and continuously working to improve. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:25">[00:55:25]</a>

## KL Rahul: The Innate Talent of a Cricketer
KL Rahul's [[impact_of_background_and_upbringing_on_career_choices | upbringing]] in Mangalore, with both parents being professors, played a role in his path. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:12">[00:57:12]</a> He started playing cricket at two and a half years old, exhibiting an early love for the sport. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:47">[00:58:47]</a> His parents were supportive of his cricketing aspirations but maintained strict academic conditions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:52">[01:14:52]</a>

Rahul strongly believes in inherent talent in sports, particularly hand-eye coordination, which he feels cannot be fully acquired if not naturally present. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:15">[01:03:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:13">[01:04:13]</a> He notes that playing multiple sports helped him develop overall athleticism, beneficial for cricket. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:29">[00:59:29]</a>

### Managing Pressure and Public Scrutiny
Rahul often visits temples, not for forgiveness or thanks, but as a reminder of his humble beginnings and to maintain gratitude, which helps him stay grounded in a demanding profession. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:22">[01:20:22]</a> He finds that not worrying about the outcome helps him perform better in cricket. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:41">[01:24:41]</a>

He discussed the challenges of public scrutiny and trolling, admitting that a particular interview "scarred" him, making him less confident and more withdrawn. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:57">[01:27:57]</a> His strategy for dealing with it is to "get off Instagram completely" and avoid consuming negative content. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:47">[01:32:47]</a>

Recognizing the finite "shelf life" of an athlete, Rahul started planning for his post-cricket career around age 30, investing in businesses to ensure a smoother [[transition_from_childhood_to_career_in_a_business_family | transition]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:09">[02:17:09]</a> He values the stability and grounding provided by his relationship, which he sees as crucial for focus and well-being. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:57">[02:29:57]</a>

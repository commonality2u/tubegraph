## Ghazal's Journey: From Insecurity to Confidence

Ghazal candidly shared her journey of self-discovery, highlighting initial confusion and uncertainty about her path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06"></a>. Despite being an "overachieving allrounder" in her early years—a top student, sports captain, and best artist until grade 10—she harbored deep insecurities about her physical appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33"></a>.

She recalled believing she was the "most horrible looking girl that could exist" up until grade 12, attributing this to her dark complexion and height compared to other girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21"></a>. This self-image issue was so profound that she avoided events like farewell parties or ramp walks, lacking the [[personal_stories_of_overcoming_stage_fright_and_building_confidence | confidence]] to dress up or go on stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15"></a>.

A pivotal shift occurred after grade 12 when she started receiving attention and compliments, which helped her overcome these insecurities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16"></a>. Her mother played a crucial role in this transformation, consciously bringing home magazines and complimenting Ghazal to build her [[personal_stories_of_overcoming_stage_fright_and_building_confidence | self-confidence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31"></a>.

This personal journey highlighted that gaining confidence in one's appearance can be a significant step toward developing overall self-confidence, a vital trait for any entrepreneur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:51"></a>.

## Manish's Journey: No Ego, Relentless Conviction

Manish's entrepreneurial philosophy emphasizes a distinctive blend of conviction and practicality, driven by a "no ego" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:56"></a>. He views the willingness to bend and be "shameless" in pursuit of business as a superpower in a world full of ego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:03"></a>.

He operates with clear objectives, prioritizing profit as a fundamental aspect of any business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:01"></a>. This "rigidity" in adhering to his core concept, like the deliberate placement of his brand's logo on the belly of shirts, stems from a contrarian view backed by full conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:18"></a>. His journey shows that an intense attention to detail, from store fragrance to garment fit, is essential for differentiation in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:19"></a>.

## Ritesh's Journey: Calm, Humble, and Self-Aware

Ritesh projects a calm, unassuming, and amicable persona, which some perceive as a "mask" that hides his true self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:52"></a>. However, he strives to maintain a sense of calm within himself and around him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:32"></a>. He describes his personality traits as:
*   **Calmness:** Expressing anger in words rather than volatile actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:51"></a>.
*   **Spirituality:** A deep [[spirituality_and_work_ethos | belief in a greater power]] and a sense of gratitude for what he has received, stemming from his upbringing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:14"></a>. He identifies as spiritual rather than religious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:20"></a>.
*   **Imposter Complex:** He admits to having an "imposter complex," feeling that he has received more than he deserved and is not the smartest or most hardworking, despite his success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:08"></a>. This self-deprecating nature is seen as attractive and a "novelty" in the startup ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:47"></a>.
*   **Vulnerability:** He believes in being "absolutely straightforward, honest, vulnerable" with his highly talented management team, fostering an environment where colleagues spend more time together than with families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:12"></a>. This openness comes from being truly comfortable in one's own skin, dispelling the need for self-embellishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:55"></a>.
*   **Contrarian Mindset:** His "rebellious nature" from childhood, often a "rebel without a cause," led him to be contrarian, a trait he believes is valuable for entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:57"></a>. He highlights that a startup, by definition, builds something "against convention" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:03"></a>.
*   **Humility:** He stresses the importance of humility, especially for new entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:05"></a>. He believes one can be self-confident (e.g., "I can build OYO into an incredible success") and humble simultaneously (e.g., "it's the first time I'm building a hotel business, so I don't know what will go in this journey but I will figure it out") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:32"></a>. This allows for an "easy, approachable manner" with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:34"></a>.

He learned to admit mistakes early, considering it "critical" for effective leadership and fostering authentic conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:55"></a>. He also emphasizes the importance of remaining optimistic, even when facing significant challenges and [[coping_with_public_scrutiny_and_maintaining_personal_peace | public scrutiny]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:22"></a>. He believes that the ability to "get punched" and recover quickly, without reacting defensively, is a major precursor to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:03"></a>.

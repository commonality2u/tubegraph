The WTFund is not a traditional fund, but rather a grant initiative designed to support the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It aims to allocate money and time to young people with great ideas who lack the financial means to execute them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Mission and Target Audience
The core mission of the WTFund is to provide the first non-dilutive grant for founders aged 25 and under <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The fund specifically targets individuals under the age of 25 who possess innovative concepts but no money to execute them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Application and Funding Process
The WTFund initiated its first round with 1,500 applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This large pool was subsequently narrowed down to 160 shortlisted candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. From these, the fund proudly presented its first nine funded [[innovative_startups_funded_by_wtfund | startups]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

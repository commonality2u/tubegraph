## Birth and Childhood
Narendra Modi was born in Vadnagar, a small town in the Mehsana district of North Gujarat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. When he was a child, Vadnagar had a population of about 15,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. He describes his village as being part of the Gaekwad State, which had a strong emphasis on education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. Common features of such villages included a pond, a post office, and a library <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

## Education
He attended a primary school built by the Gaekwad State <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. He learned to swim in the village pond, where he would wash clothes for his family to be allowed access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. His secondary education was at the charitable BN High School (Bhagavatacharya Narayanacharya High School) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. At that time, the schooling system was 11th grade, not the 10+2 system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

Modi describes himself as a "very average student" who went unnoticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. He lacked interest in exams and competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>, stating he would "run away from it" if there was an element of competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. However, he was very active in other activities and had a natural ability to quickly grasp new things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

## Early Influences and Aspirations
A teacher named Belji Bhai had high expectations of him, telling his father about his potential but noting his lack of focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. He also had a PT (physical training) teacher, Mr. Parmar, who inspired him to regularly practice wrestling and "stool pillar" exercises, which he considered a great form of yoga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. He would wake up at 5:00 AM to train with this teacher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

One of his earliest setbacks was not being able to attend a Sainik School (military school) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:15">[01:01:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:11">[01:02:11]</a>. He had seen an advertisement for it in the newspaper and sent a money order for one rupee to apply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:05">[01:02:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:17">[01:02:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a>. His high school principal, Rasbihari Maniyar, helped him understand the application process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:29">[01:02:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:58">[01:02:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:05">[01:03:05]</a>. However, his father stated they had no money and it was not in their village, making it impossible for him to go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:14">[01:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:17">[01:03:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:20">[01:03:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:22">[01:03:22]</a>. This was his first perceived setback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>.

Another unfulfilled aspiration was to lead a saintly life, specifically joining the Ramakrishna Mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:48">[01:03:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:17">[01:04:17]</a>. He met Swami Atmasthanand Ji, but did not meet the mission's qualifications, leading to his rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:02">[01:04:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:11">[01:04:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:21">[01:04:21]</a>. Despite these "setbacks," he was not disappointed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:28">[01:04:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:31">[01:04:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:34">[01:04:34]</a>.

## Self-Perception and Beliefs
Modi cultivated a learning style by observing and understanding non-verbal communication, compensating for his limited Hindi fluency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. He states that his life was not "created" but rather shaped by circumstances and challenges, which he considers his "biggest university" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:22">[00:31:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:52">[00:31:52]</a>. He claims to have "fallen in love with trouble" as it taught him a lot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.

His core belief system can be summarized as "Nation First" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:24">[00:35:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:34">[00:35:34]</a>. He believes that if something aligns with this principle, he is willing to discard old methods and embrace new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:56">[00:35:56]</a>. His decision-making is guided by a "zero fear" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:08">[01:10:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:12">[01:10:12]</a>. He states that he "doesn't care at all" about himself, which he attributes to his unusual risk-taking capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:40">[01:09:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:43">[01:09:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:52">[01:09:52]</a>. His life is seen as "one life, one mission" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:28">[01:10:28]</a>.

He developed his Hindi speaking skills by interacting with milk traders from Mumbai at the railway station tea stall where he sold tea as a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:12">[01:51:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:15">[01:51:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:19">[01:51:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:19">[01:52:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:23">[01:52:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:26">[01:52:26]</a>. This interaction, though with laborers, involved singing bhajans and kirtans in the evenings, helping him learn Hindi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:31">[01:52:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:35">[01:52:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:38">[01:52:38]</a>.

## Personal Habits and Experiences
Modi practices a habit of self-reflection, referred to as "meeting myself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:49">[01:10:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:52">[01:10:52]</a>. He would take three or four days each year to stay in isolated places with no human presence, like jungles with water facilities, to be alone with himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:09">[01:11:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:15">[01:11:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:19">[01:11:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:25">[01:11:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a>. During these times, without mobile phones or newspapers, he would focus on understanding himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:35">[01:11:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:40">[01:11:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:54">[01:11:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:02">[01:12:02]</a>. An example of this is his experience in a desert village called Dhor near the India-Pakistan border, where he was hosted by a Muslim family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:28">[01:12:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:34">[01:13:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:38">[01:13:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:39">[01:13:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:45">[01:13:45]</a>. This experience, alongside his time in the Himalayas, fostered a spiritual feeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:36">[01:14:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:42">[01:14:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:46">[01:14:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:49">[01:14:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:53">[01:14:53]</a>. He later transformed Dhor into a major tourist destination, which has won a global award <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:57">[01:14:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:03">[01:15:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:07">[01:15:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:11">[01:15:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:13">[01:15:13]</a>.

Modi left home at a young age, which meant he lost touch with his family and childhood friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:52">[01:10:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:56">[01:10:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:59">[01:10:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:01">[01:11:01]</a>. When he became Chief Minister, he made an effort to reunite with his classmates and teachers, publicly honoring his teachers as a gesture of gratitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:23">[01:12:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:27">[01:12:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:27">[01:13:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:30">[01:13:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:33">[01:13:33]</a>. He also called all his family members to his CM residence, as he had not known them due to his early departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:36">[01:14:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:47">[01:14:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:52">[01:14:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:55">[01:14:55]</a>. Additionally, he invited families who had provided him with food during his early life to his home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:12">[01:15:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:16">[01:15:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:19">[01:15:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:23">[01:15:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:29">[01:15:29]</a>.# Narendra Modi's Early Life and Education

He believes that if something aligns with this principle, he is willing to discard old methods and embrace new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:56">[00:35:56]</a>. His decision-making is guided by a "zero fear" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:08">[01:10:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:12">[01:10:12]</a>. He states that he "doesn't care at all" about himself, which he attributes to his unusual risk-taking capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:40">[01:09:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:43">[01:09:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:52">[01:09:52]</a>. His life is seen as "one life, one mission" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:28">[01:10:28]</a>.

He developed his Hindi speaking skills by interacting with milk traders from Mumbai at the railway station tea stall where he sold tea as a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:12">[01:51:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:15">[01:51:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:19">[01:51:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:19">[01:52:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:23">[01:52:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:26">[01:52:26]</a>. This interaction, though with laborers, involved singing bhajans and kirtans in the evenings, helping him learn Hindi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:31">[01:52:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:35">[01:52:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:38">[01:52:38]</a>.

### Self-Reflection
Modi practices a habit of self-reflection, referred to as "meeting myself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:49">[01:10:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:52">[01:10:52]</a>. He would take three or four days each year to stay in isolated places with no human presence, like jungles with water facilities, to be alone with himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:09">[01:11:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:15">[01:11:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:19">[01:11:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:25">[01:11:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a>. During these times, without mobile phones or newspapers, he would focus on understanding himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:35">[01:11:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:40">[01:11:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:54">[01:11:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:02">[01:12:02]</a>. An example of this is his experience in a desert village called Dhor near the India-Pakistan border, where he was hosted by a Muslim family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:28">[01:12:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:34">[01:13:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:38">[01:13:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:39">[01:13:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:45">[01:13:45]</a>. This experience, alongside his time in the Himalayas, fostered a spiritual feeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:36">[01:14:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:42">[01:14:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:46">[01:14:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:49">[01:14:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:53">[01:14:53]</a>. He later transformed Dhor into a major tourist destination, which has won a global award <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:57">[01:14:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:03">[01:15:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:07">[01:15:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:11">[01:15:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:13">[01:15:13]</a>.

### Personal Connections
Modi left home at a young age, which meant he lost touch with his family and childhood friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:52">[01:10:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:56">[01:10:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:59">[01:10:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:01">[01:11:01]</a>. When he became Chief Minister, he made an effort to reunite with his classmates and teachers, publicly honoring his teachers as a gesture of gratitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:23">[01:12:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:27">[01:12:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:27">[01:13:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:30">[01:13:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:33">[01:13:33]</a>. He also called all his family members to his CM residence, as he had not known them due to his early departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:36">[01:14:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:47">[01:14:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:52">[01:14:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:55">[01:14:55]</a>. Additionally, he invited families who had provided him with food during his early life to his home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:12">[01:15:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:16">[01:15:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:19">[01:15:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:23">[01:15:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:29">[01:15:29]</a>. This was part of his desire to remain the same person he was before gaining prominence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:40">[01:11:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:44">[01:11:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:46">[01:11:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:48">[01:11:48]</a>. His first phone call after successfully hoisting the tricolor flag in Srinagar's Lal Chowk was to his mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:22">[01:16:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:26">[01:16:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:39">[01:16:39]</a>. His mother, who was uneducated, offered him two pieces of advice when he became 100 years old: "work smartly" and "live a life of purity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:15">[01:18:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:20">[01:18:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:23">[01:18:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:47">[01:18:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:51">[01:18:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:59">[01:18:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01">[01:19:01]</a>.

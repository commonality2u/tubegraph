### Early Life and Detachment

From a young age, the speaker identified as an introvert and felt a strong sense of [[personal_detachment_and_emotional_connections|detachment]] or [[personal_detachment_and_emotional_connections|indifference]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. They recall a faint memory from around age four or five where a friend leaving home caused intense internal pain, leading them to "close up" and "detach" from everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>. This detachment was not something developed in their professional life but was present from a very young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>. Growing up, they were "scared of" their short-tempered father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>, who never shouted or raised a hand, but whose volatile temperament created fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. This led to a lifelong discomfort with louder tones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. The speaker stopped crying very early on in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>.

### Family Relationships

*   **Father:** The speaker's father was a short-tempered but good man who loved his family and work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. However, he was very distant and struggled with [[personal_detachment_and_emotional_connections|vulnerability]] and expressing love, rarely holding hands or hugging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. The speaker admits they never understood their father's point of view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. After his passing, the speaker experienced a panic attack because they didn't know how to express themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a> and felt [[personal_reflections_and_life_choices|guilt]] for not having the "grace to let go of the distance" and hug him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>. They didn't cry at his passing and believe they haven't truly grieved or understood the loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>.
*   **Mother:** The speaker has a "great relationship" with their mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>, who would often talk to them about her feelings during childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. The speaker feels their own personality is "more like my mother's" â€“ calm, happy, and easygoing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:45">[01:26:45]</a>.
*   **Sister:** The speaker is not "as close to her as I would like to be" with their sister, due to having missed out on key bonding years because of their separate educational paths and marriage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>.
*   **Daughter:** The birth of their daughter was the top high point of their life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:37">[01:16:37]</a>. Becoming a father was a "game changer" that made them question their [[personal_detachment_and_emotional_connections|detachment]] and [[personal_detachment_and_emotional_connections|indifference]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. They describe a feeling of being "reborn" and experiencing new emotions and feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>. This new perspective even changed their views on death, wanting to live longer for their daughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>. They describe the feeling of their daughter's birth as "somebody's kind of taking a your heart out and just put it in your hand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>.

### Romantic Relationships and Marriage

Despite a past public perception as a "Playboy guy" and being labeled a "cheater," the speaker maintains that these labels were not entirely true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>. They believe in "one woman forever" as the "only healthy way of living" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:21">[00:55:21]</a>. They are very lucky to be married to someone who is their "best friend" and with whom they can "chat, laugh" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>. Their wife, Alia, is described as a "wonderful person" and "extremely intelligent" and ambitious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:39">[00:57:39]</a>. The wife has made significant efforts to adjust, such as changing her loud tone of voice, which had rattled the speaker due to childhood experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:15">[00:58:15]</a>. The speaker acknowledges their wife has "changed more for me than I have changed for her" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:04">[00:58:04]</a>. Living together during the COVID-19 lockdown "solidified" their relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:16">[01:00:16]</a>, and their wife was very supportive during the father's illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:18">[01:00:18]</a>. The strong bond between their mother and wife makes them "very happy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:20">[01:01:20]</a>.

### Emotional Expression and [[coping_with_public_scrutiny_and_maintaining_personal_peace|Coping with Public Scrutiny]]

The speaker has a history of not expressing themselves or crying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:36">[00:36:36]</a>. They tried therapy before their father got sick but found it didn't work for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>. One reason was not being able to "completely honestly express myself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:35:36]</a>, and the other was feeling the therapist was "teaching me how to manipulate life" to avoid stress, which they didn't want to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:44">[00:35:44]</a>. They admit they are "very scared of opening myself up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:44">[00:36:44]</a>.

Regarding [[coping_with_public_scrutiny_and_maintaining_personal_peace|public scrutiny]], the speaker acknowledges that being labeled a "Playboy guy" and "cheater" used to bother them, especially when it upset their parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:11">[00:54:11]</a>. However, they eventually realized they are a "commodity" in the public eye, and external opinions no longer matter as much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:52">[00:54:52]</a>, as there are "millions of problems which are way more important" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:07">[00:55:07]</a>. They try to remain balanced, not feeling "extreme high" from success or "extreme lows" from failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:15">[01:16:15]</a>. They believe in the philosophy of "I don't mind what happens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:06">[01:25:06]</a>.

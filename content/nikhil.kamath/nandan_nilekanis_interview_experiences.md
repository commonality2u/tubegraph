Nandan Nilekani has participated in numerous interviews throughout his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Leading up to one particular interview, the interviewer spent 48 hours reviewing a multitude of his past appearances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, describing the task as akin to being a "sucker for punishment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This preparation led the interviewer to feel "intimidated" prior to their discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

During the interview, the interviewer noted that Nandan's public speaking in this particular format — speaking "at length publicly in that way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a> — offered a unique glimpse into his personality, suggesting a deeper, more private side not often seen in his public appearances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Towards the end of the conversation, Nilekani was surprised when asked if he wanted to take a break before the "next part," as he believed the interview was already concluded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

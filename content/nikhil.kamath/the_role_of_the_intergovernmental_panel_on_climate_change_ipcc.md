The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is widely considered the "Bible of this industry" due to its authoritative role in [[Understanding climate change and its impact | climate change]] assessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. Engagement with the IPCC is crucial for ensuring that policy positions are based on rigorous scientific work and publication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

## Structure and Purpose
The IPCC is composed of three working groups:
*   Science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>
*   Impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>
*   Response Strategies (addressing how to respond to [[Climate change impacts | climate change]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>

Its primary function is to compile existing information into an authoritative assessment, rather than generating new research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. An example of this is Chapter 13, which focuses on national and subnational policies and institutions required to address [[Understanding climate change and its impact | climate change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

## The Assessment Process
The IPCC's assessment cycle spans seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. The process is highly complex and painstaking, involving authors from around the world collaborating through various means, including Zoom calls during periods like COVID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. A key feature of the process is the rigorous review and approval by governments on a line-by-line basis, particularly for the summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

During approval sessions, which can last for a week, authors present findings (e.g., "is [[Understanding climate change and its impact | climate change]] real," "what are the likely impacts") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. Governments suggest modifications, and authors must ensure consistency with scientific evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. Probability metrics are used to indicate likelihood (e.g., 50% likely, 90% likely, highly likely) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. This intensive process, though unwieldy and cumbersome, leads to highly vetted reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

## Scientific Underpinnings
The IPCC reports rely on robust scientific methods:
*   **Ice Core Data**: Analysis of ice cores, like the Vostok ice core data extending back 800,000 years, reveals historical concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) in trapped air bubbles and allows for correlation with temperature records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:35">[00:48:35]</a>. This shows a direct relationship between spikes in CO2 and temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:37">[00:49:37]</a>.
*   **Climate Models**: Complex climate models are used to simulate temperature trends with and without human influence, demonstrating a near-perfect match with real-world observations when human impact is included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:45]</a>.
*   **Attribution Science**: This specialized science quantifies how much more likely extreme weather events (e.g., floods, wildfires) are in a warming climate compared to a non-climate-warming world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:06">[00:54:06]</a>.

## Challenges and External Influences
The IPCC process faces challenges due to the sheer complexity of [[Understanding climate change and its impact | climate change]], involving interconnected systems like oceans, atmosphere, and various greenhouse gases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:52">[00:51:52]</a>. There has also been documented evidence of disinformation campaigns, often funded by fossil fuel companies, contributing to [[Understanding climate change and its impact | climate change]] skepticism, particularly in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:10">[00:49:10]</a>.

Politically, the inclusion of "carbon dioxide removal" or "abatement technologies" in discussions of low-carbon development is influenced by oil-producing countries to justify continued fossil fuel extraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:20">[02:26:20]</a>. This political dynamic also influences the focus on technologies like carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:34">[02:26:34]</a>.

Ultimately, the IPCC's reports aim to provide a comprehensive, critically reviewed synthesis of scientific knowledge, guiding global efforts to address the [[Understanding climate change and its impact | climate crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:15">[00:52:15]</a>.

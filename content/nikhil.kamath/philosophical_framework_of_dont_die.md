"Don't Die" is presented as a comprehensive framework that extends beyond mere survival, encompassing various aspects of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

## Nature of the Framework
The "Don't Die" concept functions as:
*   A [[detachment_and_personal_philosophy | philosophical framework]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>
*   An economic plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>
*   A political guideline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>
*   A moral code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>
*   A social principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>

## Core Rules
The framework is built upon fundamental rules aimed at preserving life and the planet:
1.  **Don't kill each other** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. This is emphasized as a critical component, with one speaker stating they are "completely sold" on this idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.
2.  **Don't kill the planet** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>, meaning one "can't destroy the planet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.

## Application and Considerations
The framework suggests aligning [[perspectives_on_ai_and_its_significance | AI]] development with the "Don't Die" principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. A hypothetical scenario is posed regarding conflicts that might arise if not dying requires actions that violate other rules, such as eating another's heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

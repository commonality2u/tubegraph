## Challenges in Providing Guidance

Children may ask their parents, "mommy daddy tell me one platform I should not touch," to which a challenging response might be "the entire phone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This highlights the difficulty in providing specific guidance on which platforms to avoid.

## Parental Behavior on Social Media

Parents themselves engage with social media. For instance, a mother might post on Facebook, stating, "I have the worst kids in the world tags" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Such posts can lead to interactions where a child might ask, "hey I'm sending this I totally just box your mother" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

The motivation for posting, such as sharing holiday pictures, can be linked to a "vicious cycle of a [[role_of_social_media_in_dopamine_addiction | dopamine hit]]" that occurs at both the platform and micro levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

### Generational Traits and Fickleness
One perspective on the current generation identifies a "big flaw" as being "so fickle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The speaker also noted that a small group of four individuals were "not very representative" of their generation or their current area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

### Early Entrepreneurial Experiences and Tech Aptitude
In terms of technology, a project, possibly a chat application, was built in just three days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. The name "Zepto" was conceived based on "a measurable time in physics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. An [[entrepreneurship_and_women_in_tech | entrepreneurship Community]] is comprised of approximately 25,000 women who are actively trying to sell software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This endeavor is highlighted as an effective "crash course in sales" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. One individual involved in these discussions was 18 years old just "24 months ago" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

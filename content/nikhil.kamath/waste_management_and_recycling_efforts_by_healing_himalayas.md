The Himalayan region, despite its natural beauty, faces significant [[environmental_issues_in_the_himalayas | environmental issues]] due to waste, particularly from tourism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Tourists often leave behind substantial amounts of trash, impacting the pristine environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Recognizing this critical problem, the non-profit organization Healing Himalayas has dedicated itself to addressing waste management in the mountains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Healing Himalayas Foundation

Healing Himalayas is an initiative focused on cleaning up garbage in the Himalayan mountains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. The organization strives to establish a circular economy of waste management, initially within Manali <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. The founder, Pradeep Sangwan, originally from Haryana, settled in Manali after exploring the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. His motivation stemmed from observing the minimal environmental footprint of traditional shepherd communities compared to the significant waste generated by the boom in adventure [[impact_of_tourism_on_the_himalayan_region | tourism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. Pradeep Sangwan was also a recipient of the WTA climate fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

### Core Activities

Healing Himalayas implements a multi-phase approach to waste management:

1.  **Community Engagement and Cleaning Drives**: The first phase involves engaging with local communities and organizing cleaning drives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. Volunteers, including students from Manali Public School, participate in extensive clean-up hikes, collecting trash along the way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. The organization emphasizes the importance of [[environmental_awareness_and_education | environmental awareness]], noting that littering is not linked to education levels, as even educated individuals contribute to the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

2.  **Waste Collection and Processing**: The second phase focuses on setting up [[material_recovery_facilities_and_waste_processing | material recovery facilities]] (MRFs) to build capacity for waste collection, storage, and segregation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

    *   **Process at an MRF**: Once collected, waste is brought to the MRF where it undergoes several steps:
        *   **Spotting and Identifying**: Trash is initially spotted and identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
        *   **Segregation**: Waste is sorted into different categories, such as glass bottles, RDF (Refuse-Derived Fuel), and PET plastic bottles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
        *   **Compression and Baling**: Sorted materials are compressed and baled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
        *   **Transport for Recycling**: Baled recyclable and non-recyclable materials are then transported for further processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

### Challenges and Future Vision

Healing Himalayas has faced challenges, including resistance from villagers concerned about potential foul smells, flies, and a decrease in [[impact_of_tourism_on_the_himalayan_region | tourism]] due to the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. Despite these hurdles, the organization works to gradually demonstrate the positive impact of proper waste management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

The third phase of Healing Himalayas' strategy is to establish recycling centers directly within districts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Given that Kullu has the highest footfall of [[impact_of_tourism_on_the_himalayan_region | tourism]] in Himachal Pradesh, the goal is to set up recycling units there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. This will allow collected waste to be recycled and reused locally within the district, promoting [[climate_change_solutions | sustainability]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

Healing Himalayas' efforts aim to preserve the mountains and work towards a net-zero impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

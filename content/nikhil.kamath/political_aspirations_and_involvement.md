The speaker addresses the common question of whether they will ever enter [[politics]] by stating they have no current intention to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Encouraging Youth Engagement

The speaker notes a perceived lack of optimism among younger generations, specifically those born after 1995 or 2000, compared to previous generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Their message to this demographic is to "get [[youth_involvement_in_politics | involved]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. They suggest that instead of remaining on the sidelines and commenting online, individuals should "get into the arena and actually give it a go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This highlights a call for direct [[perceptions_of_political_engagement | political engagement]] rather than passive observation.

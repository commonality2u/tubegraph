The speaker emphasizes the significant and evolving [[increasing_womens_participation_in_the_workforce_in_india | role of women]] in Indian politics, highlighting opportunities for leadership and active participation.

## Current Opportunities for Women in Politics
Across almost every state in India, there is women's reservation in village panchayats, head municipalities, and municipal corporations, potentially around 50% [02:02:22]. This aims to foster true leadership among women [02:02:44]. The speaker encourages mothers and young daughters to develop leadership qualities and actively participate [02:03:05].

In the near future, there is a push for 30% reservation for women in MLA (Member of Legislative Assembly) and MP (Member of Parliament) positions [02:03:16]. This initiative presents a significant opportunity for women to enter politics and contribute to the nation's development [02:03:33]. The speaker advises women to prepare themselves and work towards becoming worthy candidates in the next four years [02:03:26].

## Women in Leadership: Example of President Draupadi Murmu
The current President of India, Draupadi Murmu, comes from the tribal section of society [00:59:31]. Her background deeply influences policy-making, demonstrating how diverse representation can lead to impactful change. For example, under her guidance, the PM Janman scheme was developed, allowing tribal people to access up to 25 lakh rupees [01:00:07]. This scheme targets very backward, scattered groups and aims to uplift those who were previously overlooked by politicians due to lack of immediate electoral gain [01:00:00]. This initiative brings immense satisfaction, as it serves those whom "no one asked" [01:00:44].

## Encouragement for Women's Participation
The speaker urges young women to not shy away from politics [02:03:48]. He states that politics is not merely about elections, power, or personal gain [02:03:53]. Instead, it is a field of public service that requires individuals born from creativity, willing to understand the suffering of others, and capable of finding solutions rather than merely criticizing [02:04:09]. The country needs new leadership that can drive significant change and prepare for the vision of a developed India by 2047 [02:04:30]. This era is particularly ripe for young women to come forward and bring freshness to the political landscape across all parties [02:05:00].

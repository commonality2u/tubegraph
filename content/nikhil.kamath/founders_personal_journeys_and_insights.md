## Vidit Atre
Vidit Atre, who runs Meesho, grew up in Rohini, Delhi, with his family originating from Meerut and Hapur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:02">[02:02:02]</a>. He was the first engineer in his family, which primarily consisted of farmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:02">[02:14:02]</a>. His father instilled a belief that only two professions existed: a government job or sitting on a shop's *dukaan* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:02">[02:29:02]</a>. This perspective shaped his early life until he attended IIT Delhi, where he realized the world was not "bipolar" and offered many more opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:02">[02:53:02]</a>.

After college, Vidit joined ITC in Chennai, a role that involved heavy operations and placed him in an uncomfortable environment where Tamil was the primary language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:02">[03:07:02]</a>. He reflects that these first two years of his career, being pushed into [[overcoming_challenges_and_personal_stories_in_careers | uncomfortable situations]] and navigating language and food differences, were "pretty cool" in retrospect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:02">[03:46:02]</a>. In 2015, after moving to Bangalore, he was "bitten by the [[entrepreneurship_and_starting_anew | entrepreneurial bug]]" and co-founded Meesho <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:02">[04:36:02]</a>.

He connects with the idea that rebellious or independent thinking can be a factor in doing "something crazy," as it challenges the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:02">[09:50:02]</a>. Vidit observes that today's children, despite having more access to information and infrastructure, still share a "feeling of constraint" similar to previous generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:02">[10:13:02]</a>. He suggests that while coming from a lower-middle-class background meant money was a top-of-mind concern, it's hard to definitively attribute later success to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:02">[11:29:02]</a>.

On a [[personal_and_professional_growth_experiences_and_reflections | personal note]], Vidit is described as very certain about what he wants in life, exhibiting a "weird kind of contentment" that makes him a "complete as an emotional human being," a unique trait for someone so young in their career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:52:02">[33:52:02]</a>. His wife is also a successful entrepreneur with her women-focused fitness brand, My Bliss Club <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:05:02">[32:05:02]</a>.

## Kishore Biyani's Journey
Kishore Biyani, founder of the Future Group, was born and raised in Bombay and studied commerce, with a keen interest in marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:02">[06:38:02]</a>. His [[the_role_of_childhood_experiences_in_shaping_entrepreneurs | childhood experiences]] were marked by a conservative, religious family, where he was an "atheist always" and known as the "black sheep" for his contrarian thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:02">[07:41:02]</a>. He chose not to join the family's wholesale fabric trading business, instead starting his own trouser brand in the early 90s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:02">[07:54:02]</a>.

Biyani believes that "shortages or less availability does definitely makes you work harder and make you expand your mind and thoughts," contrasting his upbringing with children born in "abundance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:02">[08:47:02]</a>. He also asserts that "rebelliousness definitely creates something," as a rebel "like[s] to destroy something and create something new" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:02">[12:56:02]</a>. He exemplified this by creating a popular 'stonewash' fabric, then building denim brands, and eventually establishing various retail formats like Big Bazaar, Central, Food Hall, and Brand Factory, catering to a wide range of audiences from rural areas to luxury consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:02">[13:13:02]</a>. He describes his journey as 30 years of compounding growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:56:02">[15:56:02]</a>.

His approach to retail was heavily influenced by observing local Indian markets (*bazars* and *haats*) and temples like Tirupati, where he learned about crowd management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:42:02">[16:42:02]</a>. He sees himself as a "father of organizing retail" in India, having given genesis to the idea that retail can be structured at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:44:02">[17:44:02]</a>. A key insight was creating "consumer understanding" by studying societal changes every six months through his organization, Future Brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:12:02">[18:12:02]</a>.

Reflecting on his journey, Biyani shares his philosophy that "life is a series of events and you have to enjoy relish cherish every event" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:35:02">[34:35:02]</a>. He acknowledges his "fatal flaw" as an impulsive person who grew his business on debt without building a strong balance sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:53:02">[35:53:02]</a>. He advocates for entrepreneurs to recognize their flaws to make fewer mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:52:02">[36:52:02]</a>. His organizations always welcomed "dissent" and avoided "echo chambers," allowing for honest feedback, although he admits it's challenging for entrepreneurs to get unbiased criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:10:02">[40:10:02]</a>.

## Sujit Kumar's Journey
Sujit Kumar, an early member of Flipkart and a seasoned investor, hails from Bhabua in Bihar, a very small town where he studied in Hindi medium until 12th grade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:19:02">[20:19:02]</a>. He attributes his unexpected entry into IIT Delhi to sheer luck, as he had initially aimed for IIT BHU, wanting to be the "king of that campus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:31:02">[20:31:02]</a>. Delhi was his first big city exposure, which opened his eyes to many new things, including sports like billiards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:22:02">[21:22:02]</a>.

Initially, he considered preparing for UPSC exams but decided against it after six months, realizing it wasn't his interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:39:02">[23:39:02]</a>. He then decided to join a small firm to learn and, in 2004-2005, became a co-founder of a KPO (Knowledge Process Outsourcing) company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:16:02">[24:16:02]</a>. The 2008 recession led to the closure of this venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:40:02">[24:40:02]</a>.

In 2008, he joined Flipkart, then a proprietorship, and played a crucial role in managing supply chain, operations, and categories for the first four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:34:02">[27:34:02]</a>. He also started E-kart, Flipkart's logistics arm, in 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:23:02">[28:23:02]</a>. After leaving Flipkart in 2016, he co-founded Gunorg and became an active angel investor, with investments in around 150 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:34:02">[29:34:02]</a>.

Sujit notes a shift in his [[personal_interests_of_industry_leaders | investment focus]] from pure tech to non-tech sectors like food and QSR (Quick Service Restaurants), believing they can scale significantly in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:28:02">[30:28:02]</a>. He is backing entrepreneurs building "Domino's kind of business" and South Indian food chains, envisioning 2,000-3,000 stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:00:02">[31:00:02]</a>. He observes that many profitable restaurant businesses do not wish to expand due to concerns about quality degradation and avoiding "headaches" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:10:02">[28:10:02]</a>. He views coffee chains as a recent success story, having started making money in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:35:02">[31:35:02]</a>.

Sujit shares a similar [[the_role_of_childhood_experiences_in_shaping_entrepreneurs | perspective]] to Kishore Biyani that the "feeling of constraint" is common across generations, even if the circumstances differ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:02">[10:05:02]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of having circles where people can provide honest feedback, an "investment" that doesn't happen automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:52:02">[41:52:02]</a>.

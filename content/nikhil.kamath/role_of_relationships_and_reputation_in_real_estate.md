## The Foundation of Trust

In the real estate industry, especially in Bangalore, relationships and a strong reputation are paramount. Business is often conducted on a handshake, emphasizing the importance of trust and integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. Sticking to one's word, even if it causes short-term perceived loss, builds goodwill and respect, which ultimately leads to business growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.

The sentiment among developers in Bangalore is that if one maintains their word, it is worth "any money in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. This principle is widely followed by larger companies in the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. When selling someone a home, especially when they're investing their life savings, adhering to commitments is crucial, as word quickly spreads if a builder deviates from their promises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

### Adherence to Agreements
Formalizing agreements is essential, but the initial agreed-upon terms are the most important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. Transparency is key, particularly with regulations like RERA, which require all approvals to be in place before selling, instilling greater confidence in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:07">[00:55:07]</a>. This transparency has consolidated the market, favoring those who operate professionally and sincerely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:31">[00:55:31]</a>.

## Long-Term Partnerships and Community

The real estate business often involves long-term partnerships, with developments living on for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:37">[02:50:37]</a>. Relationships with landowners are vital, as good relationships can lead to more deals through word-of-mouth referrals within the small community of people involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:21">[02:50:21]</a>. When a land owner chooses a developer for a joint venture (JD), they consider not just returns but also the company's financial conservatism, reputation, expertise, and funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:24">[02:51:24]</a>.

## Managing Competition and Ego

Despite fierce competition, particularly among Bangalore developers, there's a unique camaraderie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:09">[01:11:09]</a>. This is attributed to the belief that "enough and plenty to do for everybody" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:3:02">[01:03:02]</a>. Developers often support each other, offering advice in times of trouble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:3:52">[01:03:52]</a>. This collaborative spirit stems from shared origins and mutual respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:05">[01:12:05]</a>. Avoiding arrogance and being flexible ("learn how to bend, you'll not break") are crucial for longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:53">[01:11:53]</a>.

In [[family_management_in_real_estate_business | family businesses]], managing egos is a key [[challenges_in_the_real_estate_industry | challenge]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:23">[01:18:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:08">[01:19:08]</a>. Clear delineation of roles and verticals helps prevent internal conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:43">[01:18:43]</a>. Ultimately, the maturity of family members and focusing on the company's best interest are vital for its success, as individual wealth and careers are tied to the company's performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:07">[01:22:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:15">[01:22:15]</a>.

## Impact of Personal Brand and Integrity

A developer's personal brand, such as being a "man of his word," significantly permeates society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:4:14">[01:04:14]</a>. This [[authenticity_in_building_a_personal_brand_or_story | authenticity]] and integrity foster trust among customers and partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:15">[01:13:15]</a>. The reputation of developers in Bangalore is generally high, earning widespread respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:5:00">[01:05:00]</a>.

## Building a Company's Reputation

For new companies, the first project is the hardest due to the lack of an established brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:06">[00:57:06]</a>. However, with RERA approvals in place, which ensure sanctions and transparency, it becomes easier to build trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:17">[00:57:17]</a>. By successfully completing initial projects, even small ones, and earning customer confidence, a company can gradually build its brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:37">[00:59:37]</a>.

For a new company looking to gain market share, building a strong brand and reputation through consistent delivery is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:16">[02:53:16]</a>. This includes strong marketing, public relations, and maintaining customer service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:39">[03:11:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:32">[03:12:32]</a>. Referrals and channel partners (brokers) are also a significant part of sales, with some companies seeing up to 50% of sales through brokers who now often use technology for lead generation and bookings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:41">[01:05:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:53">[03:12:53]</a>.

## Relationships with External Entities

Dealing with government authorities and officials is part of the real estate business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a>. While some perceive a need for political connections, success depends more on execution capability and access to land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:44">[01:43:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:50">[01:43:50]</a>. Adhering to local rules and conducting proper market studies are crucial, as each city can have different nuances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:07">[01:45:07]</a>.

## [[Starting a real estate company | Starting a Real Estate Company]]: The Trust Factor

For a young aspiring real estate professional with capital, one recommended approach is to begin by engaging in small-scale property buying and selling, or initiating a joint development (JD) with a trusted landowner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:59">[00:58:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:19">[00:59:19]</a>. This hands-on experience allows for learning the nuances of the business, including contract reading and understanding local regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:23">[01:00:23]</a>. [[Starting small in real estate | Starting small]] builds confidence and establishes a brand over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:32">[00:56:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:39">[01:00:39]</a>.

While a bank may not lend for land acquisition for a new company, they are generally willing to finance construction if a JD partner provides the land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:22">[01:21:22]</a>. This approach minimizes the initial capital required for land acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:09">[01:01:09]</a>. Another viable option is to work with an operating entity in real estate, such as a co-working space, which offers high returns (20-25%) on capital and is less capital-intensive than direct development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:13">[02:48:13]</a>. However, success in such models depends on the ability to consistently attract and retain tenants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:31">[02:46:31]</a>.

Overall, the real estate industry thrives on long-term relationships, mutual trust, and a strong reputation for integrity and quality.

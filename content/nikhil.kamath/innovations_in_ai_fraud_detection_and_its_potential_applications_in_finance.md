The fraud detection space is undergoing significant transformation, with new solutions emerging to combat increasingly sophisticated scams. One such innovation involves building an "AI-powered fraud prevention infrastructure as a service" for banks and fintech companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

## The Problem: Manual Processes and Evolving Scams

Historically, fraud investigation has been a manual process, as observed during stockbroker fraud investigations at the National Stock Exchange (NSE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. These investigations uncovered a wide range of illicit activities, from Ponzi schemes to the misappropriation of securities and funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

A prominent example of past fraudulent activities includes:
*   **Off-market transfers:** A stockbroker would obtain shares as "loan of market transfers" from company promoters, then transfer these securities off-market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. This meant the transactions did not hit the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
*   **Profiting from customer accounts:** The broker would conduct trades using their own sister stockbroking company. Shares acquired at a low price (e.g., 20 rupees) would be sold at a higher price (e.g., 50 rupees) after a period, with the profit pocketed by the broker, all while happening in customer accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   **Concealing money movement:** To avoid direct transfers that could be flagged, the broker cleverly moved money out of customer accounts by taking intraday positions (e.g., five crore or ten crore rupees in Reliance or HDFC shares) and then charging "insane brokerage on these trades" for both buying and selling within minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. This method, though inefficient due to stamp duty, was "very difficult to track" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

While regulatory bodies like SEBI have significantly improved the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>, new scams continue to emerge, such as the "Ayodhya scam" where fake hotel websites trick users into making payments for non-existent hotels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. Payment aggregators are often liable for these fraudulent payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.

## AI-Powered Solutions for Financial Institutions

The new approach focuses on automating fraud detection for banks and fintechs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. This is achieved through "agentic [[understanding_ai | AIs]] who automate a lot of the processes" that are currently done manually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

Key features and benefits include:
*   **Verification beyond basic screening:** Unlike traditional "World Check" systems that primarily perform sanction screening (e.g., checking if a name is on a terrorist list) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>, this solution verifies if a person is truly who they claim to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a> and assesses their "how" (implying legitimacy or risk) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. This is done by looking at a "multitude of data points" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.
*   **Addressing merchant onboarding fraud:** For payment aggregators, the system ensures that onboarded merchants actually exist, mitigating risks from scams like the Ayodhya scam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. This also helps prevent money laundering through their platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.
*   **Mule account detection:** For small finance banks, the solution addresses the problem of "mule accounts," which are often used in financial crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.
*   **Real-time "Lifetime Monitoring":** Instead of retrospective transaction monitoring, the [[understanding_ai | AI]] automates the process of finding "red flags" and moves towards "Lifetime monitoring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>. This is crucial because banks often take months to identify and piece together fraud patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>.
*   **Graph Infrastructure:** The system builds "graph infrastructure which helps find linkages between frosters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>, enabling proactive fraud prevention.

## Regulatory Compliance and Future Prospects

To operate in the financial industry, companies must adhere to standard compliance requirements such as PCI DSS and SOC 2, which are "fairly new" compared to a decade ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. These are common for companies dealing with sensitive financial data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

The company is currently conducting pilots and expects to hit revenue soon, having found that selling to banks has been "way lesser" difficult than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. This technology has broad applicability beyond banking and fintech, with potential use cases across various sectors, including e-commerce for "return scam" detection and stockbrokers for preventing "front running" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:16:00]</a>.

Upon arriving in India for the first time, a key point of observation was the [[importance_of_air_quality_on_health | air quality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The air quality was noticeably poor, leading one individual to ask if putting on a mask would be acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Wearing a mask reportedly helped in addressing emotional needs and made the individual feel better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Impact on Real Estate

There is a direct correlation between [[real_estate_and_air_quality_in_india | real estate]] value and air quality in India; higher prices are paid for property in areas with the best Air Quality Index (AQI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Future Outlook

It is projected that within the next 5 to 10 years, many cities in India could become [[future_habitability_of_indian_cities | uninhabitable]] due to the prevailing air quality conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

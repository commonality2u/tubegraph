Indian retail is deeply characterized by the presence and influence of small businesses. These entities form the backbone of the country's commerce, particularly within its vast and diverse market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

## Dominance of Offline and Unbranded Retail
Historically, a significant portion of Indian retail has operated offline. It is estimated that 85% of India's retail activity occurs through "longtail unbranded small businesses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. This highlights their pervasive presence in the everyday lives of consumers, especially outside of major metropolitan areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

## The Shift Towards Digitization
With the rise of e-commerce, small businesses have begun to realize the necessity of an online presence, a realization that was acutely felt during events like the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:41">[01:46:41]</a>. Many adapted informally, for instance, by selling products via WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:57">[01:46:57]</a>.

### Meesho's Role in Onboarding Small Businesses
Platforms like Meesho emerged with a mission to bring these small businesses online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Meesho currently serves approximately a million small businesses, with close to 40% of its sellers being "online-only sellers" who became entrepreneurs for the first time through the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:05">[02:06:05]</a>. These entrepreneurs learn to merchandise, price, and identify trends specific to the online marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:13">[02:06:13]</a>.

### ONDC: A Government Initiative for Digitization
The government's [[India Stack and its impact on entrepreneurship | ONDC (Open Network for Digital Commerce)]] initiative aims to further this [[Digitization and its impact on retail | digitization]] by onboarding all kinds of small businesses onto a common platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:19">[01:44:19]</a>. The vision is to unbundle the entire value chain and allow small businesses, including local shops like Kirana stores, to come online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:30">[01:44:30]</a>. This is critical given that out of approximately 60 million small businesses in India, only about 1 to 1.5 million currently sell anything online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:46">[01:44:46]</a>. This contrasts sharply with Southeast Asia, where e-commerce started later but has 15 million online sellers in Indonesia alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:56">[01:44:56]</a>. The goal of ONDC is interoperability, where a seller can upload their catalog on one integrated app, and it appears on all others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:27">[01:45:27]</a>.

> The vision for ONDC is powerful: to enable any small business to come online and unbundle the entire value chain of e-commerce. This would allow for products to be listed across various platforms seamlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:32">[01:44:32]</a>.

## Consumption Patterns and Market Segmentation
Understanding the varied consumer landscape is crucial for small businesses. India is conceptualized into three consumption classes:
*   **India 1 (Consuming Class):** Those with domestic help, focused on value-added consumption. This group constitutes about 11-13%, or around 20 crore people, and is growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:21">[01:00:21]</a>.
*   **India 2 (Serving Class):** Individuals who make daily life better, such as drivers, helpers, security guards. For every one "India 1" person, there are three to three and a half "India 2" individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:31">[01:00:31]</a>.
*   **India 3 (Farm Laborers/Factory Workers):** Those largely dependent on government aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:49">[01:00:49]</a>.

While "India 1" may not generate enough income for "India 2" to significantly consume discretionary products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:40">[01:00:40]</a>, "India 2's" discretionary income is rising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:59">[01:12:59]</a>. This segment, along with "India 3," previously consumed a very limited number of SKUs annually (e.g., India 2 consumed ~400-500 SKUs, India 3 consumed ~200 SKUs, and India 2 only ~100 SKUs at one point) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:33">[01:13:33]</a>. This is now rising, expanding the potential market for various products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:48">[01:13:48]</a>. Platforms like Meesho cater to this larger audience, including a significant portion of "India 2" users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:34">[01:12:34]</a>.

## Adapting to New Channels and Consumer Aspirations
The landscape for selling products has fundamentally changed with [[digitization and its impact on retail | new communication methods]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:58">[01:09:58]</a>. Online platforms emphasize pricing more, as the ability to touch and feel a product is lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:13">[01:10:13]</a>. Social media, visual merchandising, and photographs have become highly influential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:25">[01:10:25]</a>.

A significant shift is observed in consumer buying psychology: it's less about serving basic needs and more about serving aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:02">[01:12:02]</a>. Consumers, especially those with rising discretionary income, are influenced by social media and desire to look like celebrities or influencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:05">[01:12:05]</a>. This trend is expected to grow non-linearly as per capita income rises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:20">[01:14:20]</a>. Small businesses that can fulfill these aspirations affordably will thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:40">[01:14:40]</a>.

## Future Outlook
The definitions between e-commerce, traditional commerce, and offline commerce are increasingly blurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:59">[02:04:59]</a>. To create value in modern commerce, businesses must integrate e-commerce into their strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:03">[02:05:03]</a>. The future will see more "online-native sellers" who may have no experience with traditional offline retail, starting their entrepreneurial journey directly online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:29">[02:06:29]</a>. This acceleration is driven by the power of the internet and the evolving influence of social media and influencers, which provide new, cost-effective channels for customer acquisition and engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:05">[02:07:05]</a>.

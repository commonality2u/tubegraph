Young individuals looking to enter the real estate sector should understand key strategies and the inherent nature of the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Importance of Starting Small

A fundamental piece of [[importance_of_starting_small_in_real_estate | advice for young entrepreneurs]] in real estate is the necessity to "learn to start small" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This approach allows for gradual learning and adaptation to the industry.

## Nature of the Real Estate Business

The real estate business is characterized as "the most difficult business you can be in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. It requires significant [[risktaking_and_decisionmaking_in_property_leasing | risk-taking]] and making "bold calls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Approximately 70% to 80% of all court cases are land-related <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, highlighting potential complexities and [[challenges_in_the_real_estate_business | challenges in the real estate business]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

Examples of specific areas within real estate include "office leasing at hyper speed fashion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Passion vs. Profit

While passion for real estate can develop over time, it's acknowledged that one might "learn to love" the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, similar to being in a marriage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

From an [[Entrepreneurship and Business Advice | entrepreneurial perspective]], a pragmatic approach prioritizes financial success:
> "Would you rather be passionately doing something which loses money or dispassionately doing something that makes you money?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>
The preference is to "make the money" first, then find a passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. This suggests that for young entrepreneurs, focusing on profitable ventures initially, even if dispassionately, can be a valid strategy to build capital and then pursue other interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

The concepts of legacy and [[Philanthropy and its impact | philanthropy]] are deeply ingrained in the speaker's personal and professional philosophy, influenced significantly by his family's history and core values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:04">[02:51:04]</a>.

## Defining Legacy

For the speaker, legacy is primarily about **impact**, rather than accolades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:24">[02:50:24]</a>. It refers to the effect one has on people and society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:30">[02:50:30]</a>. Within the context of his family, this impact is largely viewed through the lens of business, specifically how one connects with people and gives back to society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:37">[02:50:37]</a>. The objective is to impact lives and families directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:52">[02:50:52]</a>. The speaker also expressed a desire to carry forward his father's name and legacy by completing work his father had intended to do but couldn't finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:20">[02:23:20]</a>.

## Approach to Philanthropy

Giving back to society is seen as a fundamental responsibility, not merely an act of generosity or [[Charitable initiatives and corporate social responsibility | altruism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:20">[02:51:20]</a>. The philosophy is that businesses generate profit by taking from society, and therefore, returning a portion of that profit is a given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:26">[02:51:26]</a>. This perspective highlights that it is not considered "a big deal" or unusual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:36">[02:51:36]</a>.

### Role of Corporates in Society
The speaker believes that corporates are becoming increasingly significant stakeholders globally, perhaps even after the church in some regions or the government universally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:50">[02:51:50]</a>. This growing influence inherently brings greater responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:10">[02:52:10]</a>. Therefore, for business to play a positive role in society is considered "just part of a charter of business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:05">[02:53:05]</a>.

### "Gupt Daan" (Secret Giving)
A notable aspect of the family's approach to [[Philanthropy and its impact | philanthropy]] is the tradition of "gupt daan," or secret giving, meaning charitable acts that do not need to be talked about or revealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:48">[02:54:48]</a>. There is little to no documentation of the extensive charitable work done by the family across generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:29">[02:53:29]</a>. While the speaker believes documenting this would be beneficial for archival purposes, especially for future generations, most family elders have not shown interest in doing so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:57">[02:53:57]</a>. This practice suggests that giving is seen as an inherent part of their normal course of business and life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

### Influence of Mahatma Gandhi
The family's [[Concept of motivational pluralism in philanthropy and business | philosophy on philanthropy]] is deeply influenced by Mahatma Gandhi, particularly his socioeconomic concept of [[Concept of motivational pluralism in philanthropy and business | trusteeship]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:43">[02:55:43]</a>. This concept posits that private companies should function for collective prosperity rather than solely as emblems of [[Role of philanthropy and capitalism in society | capitalism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:01">[02:56:01]</a>. Gandhi's influence is evident in the family's simple way of living, minimal engagement in elaborate rituals, and historical participation in the freedom movement, including symbolic acts like burning imported clothes and wearing khadi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:41">[02:56:41]</a>. The speaker's great-grandfather, a close associate of Gandhi, embraced this philosophy, which has since percolated down through the generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:15">[02:56:15]</a>.

## Personal Beliefs on Altruism and Motivation
The speaker acknowledges the idea that humans may always be chasing some kind of "high" or self-appeasement, even in acts of [[Philanthropy and its impact | philanthropy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:28">[01:00:28]</a>. However, he sees this as a natural aspect of the human mind and does not view it negatively, especially if it leads to supporting people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:32">[01:01:32]</a>. If someone dedicates their life to [[Philanthropy and its impact | philanthropy]], it's likely because they genuinely believe in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:21">[01:01:21]</a>.

## Societal Issues and Personal Convictions
The speaker holds strong convictions on societal issues, particularly advocating for equality in marriage customs, challenging traditions like dowry, and promoting equal educational opportunities for girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:33">[01:03:33]</a>. He feels it's important for opinion-makers to discuss these issues and create awareness, even if it's a long process to change mindsets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:09">[01:04:09]</a>. This aligns with his belief in speaking his mind when something truly matters to him, without concern for unpopularity or rubbing others the wrong way, as long as it comes from a place of conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:52">[01:04:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:57">[01:05:57]</a>.

## Reflection on Personal Evolution
When asked about changing deeply held beliefs, the speaker states he hasn't had significant changes in his core convictions from a younger age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:26">[01:38:26]</a>. He highlights that with new experiences, perspectives naturally evolve, but he has not had a drastic shift in fundamental beliefs or commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:19">[01:38:19]</a>. This is contrasted with the interviewer's view on "wokeness" as a societal mask rather than genuine belief, and the necessity of changing one's mind for [[Philosophical perspectives on life and survival | evolution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:52">[01:37:52]</a>. The speaker, however, maintains that people's true intentions eventually become apparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:15">[01:41:15]</a>.

Overall, the speaker's philosophy on legacy and [[Philanthropy and its impact | philanthropy]] is characterized by a strong sense of responsibility, a focus on tangible impact, historical [[Bill Gates relationship with India and philanthropy | influence from figures like Gandhi]], and a private, understated approach to charitable giving.

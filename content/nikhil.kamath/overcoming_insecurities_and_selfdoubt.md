The journeys of individuals who achieve success in unconventional careers often highlight significant personal growth, particularly in [[overcoming_challenges_and_personal_stories_in_careers | overcoming insecurities and self-doubt]]. The speakers in this discussion, who have made it in fields like acting, cricket, and music, share their unique [[personal_and_professional_growth_experiences_and_reflections | experiences and reflections]] on navigating such [[personal_and_professional_challenges | personal and professional challenges]].

## Kriti Sanon: From Shy Student to Confident Actor

Kriti Sanon describes her early life as that of a "very shy and a studious and a nerdy kid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. As a firstborn, she felt pressure to excel in studies and be a "good kid," striving for 90% grades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Remarkably, she suffered from stage fright, which she notes is "a bit shocking" given her current profession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

Despite her shyness, Kriti had an inherent talent for dance, which her mother recognized and encouraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. This early exposure to performance, even though she initially disliked classical dance, provided a "base training" that gave her body rhythm and grace, which she later utilized in her career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

### The Role of Validation and Parental Influence
Kriti acknowledges that achieving good marks and receiving appreciation for her dancing provided a "sense of validation" and pride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. Her mother, a competitive individual who fought to pursue her own dreams and PhD in a conservative family environment, instilled in Kriti a strong drive for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. Kriti reflects that her mother's pushing came from her own unfulfilled desires, such as learning to sing or swim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

### Overcoming Initial Self-Doubt in Acting
When Kriti transitioned into acting, her initial experiences were fraught with self-doubt. She describes coming back crying after her first ramp show and photoshoot because she was "so conscious" and felt she wasn't performing her best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>. The turning point was gaining confidence "with work, while working" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:47">[00:41:47]</a>. She learned that by "putting yourself in situations that you're scared of," you eventually "surpass that" and gain confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:52">[00:41:52]</a>.

Kriti notes that often, scary and exciting emotions feel the same, and she intentionally seeks out roles that "excite me while it scares me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:58">[00:42:58]</a>. She also emphasizes the importance of being a "learner" and asking "too many questions" without fear of looking stupid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:44">[00:49:44]</a>. This curiosity and willingness to learn were initially perceived negatively but later became her strength, changing [[public_perception_and_selfawareness | public perception]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:53">[00:50:53]</a>.

> "I always say ask questions because I don't you have to keep learning and growing so yes you can observe and learn but sometimes you if you have questions in your mind ask because that's the only way of getting answers." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a>

Kriti views passion not as something you are born with, but something that develops as you realize you are good at something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>. Her parents, especially her mother, were initially protective and advised against a career in acting due to its demanding nature and Kriti's perceived shyness and tendency to cry after setbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:31">[00:55:31]</a>. However, Kriti persisted:
> "I still went for it, I still was like no I can do it... So even after you fall to sort of still have the courage to get up and give it another shot and then give it another shot till you become good at it." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:02">[00:56:02]</a>

This resilience and commitment to continuous improvement allowed her to develop her acting skills and find her passion while doing the work itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:10">[02:15:10]</a>.

## Rahul's Perspective: Managing Pressure and Trolling

Rahul, a cricketer, also shares his experiences with pressure and [[managing_stress_and_mental_health | managing stress and mental health]]. Coming from a family of professors, he notes that while his parents supported his cricket dreams, they were strict about his education, threatening to "pull you out of cricket" if his grades dropped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:56">[01:14:56]</a>. This created a dual pressure to perform both academically and athletically.

### Dealing with Public Scrutiny and Trolling
Rahul reveals that he "used to be good with trolling" when he was younger, but an incident involving a widely publicized interview "changed me massively" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:27">[01:27:27]</a>. Being suspended from his vocation, having never been punished in school, left him scarred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:40">[01:28:40]</a>. He observed that people often "innately like watching people in positions of power fail and fall" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:12">[01:29:12]</a>.

To cope with negative [[public_perception_and_selfawareness | public perception]] and trolling, Rahul has learned to create a "safe space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:36">[01:31:36]</a>. He loves going back to Bangalore to his childhood friends, where "nothing enters that roomâ€”no trolling, no success, no nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. This helps him recharge and return to his professional life with renewed energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:14">[01:32:14]</a>. He has also actively reduced his social media usage, believing that "ignorance is bliss" when it comes to dealing with trolling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:22">[01:32:22]</a>. His advice to young people is to "get off social media" or at least not make it a priority for validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:17">[01:33:17]</a>.

### Mindset for Performance
Rahul emphasizes the importance of not worrying about the outcome when performing. He believes that his best performances have come when he is in a mindset of just enjoying the sport, reminding himself of why he started playing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:47">[01:22:47]</a>. This helps to "appease that anxiety" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:36">[01:23:36]</a>. He acknowledges that completely eliminating pressure is impossible, but the goal is to manage it as much as possible, as self-imposed pressure can hinder performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:25">[01:25:25]</a>.

## Badshah: The Journey of Self-Expression

Badshah, a rapper and producer, found his outlet for expression through writing. He describes himself as "always a writer because I couldn't express" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:36">[02:01:36]</a>. This personal need for expression became his foundation for songwriting and rhyming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:59">[02:01:59]</a>.

### Seeking Validation and Confidence
Similar to Kriti and Rahul, Badshah acknowledges the role of validation in his early drive. His journey began with wanting to be "cool" and seeking "some sort of validation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:41">[02:02:41]</a>. After starting as a government officer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:29">[02:08:29]</a>, his confidence significantly grew once he started collaborating and realized he was doing something unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:41">[02:09:41]</a>.

### Key Principles for Success
Badshah offers direct advice for aspiring musicians and entrepreneurs:
*   **Passion and Originality**: The primary prerequisite for success is loving what you do and being passionate about music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:14">[02:13:14]</a>. While inspiration is natural, strive for originality: "Be Inspired, don't be influenced" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:51">[02:35:51]</a>.
*   **Persistence**: Echoing Jay-Z, he states, "the only genius thing that I did was not giving up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:37">[02:13:37]</a>. He stresses that with true passion, success is "only a matter of time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:46">[02:13:46]</a>, and the biggest challenge is "not giving up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:05">[02:14:05]</a>.
*   **Patience and Hard Work**: He emphasizes the combination of "patience and hard work over a long period of time" as "very important" for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:18">[02:37:18]</a>.
*   **Strategic Entrepreneurship**: For those entering business, he advises against "cool" or "flavor of the season" industries where "too many passionate people are competing over passion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:51">[02:37:51]</a>. Instead, focus on understanding sectors that will grow significantly in the future, like energy transition or health and wellness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:18">[02:38:18]</a>.
*   **Learning from Mistakes**: In business, if something isn't working after a couple of years, "ditch it fast" and "don't have an ego about your failures" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:50">[02:39:50]</a>. This highlights [[the_significance_of_learning_from_mistakes_and_vulnerability_in_business | the significance of learning from mistakes and vulnerability in business]].

## Common Threads in Overcoming Insecurities

Across these diverse career paths, several common themes emerge regarding [[managing_stress_and_mental_health | managing stress and mental health]] and overcoming self-doubt:

*   **Embracing Discomfort**: Intentionally seeking situations that are challenging or "scary" can lead to growth and confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:52">[00:41:52]</a>.
*   **Continuous Learning and Adaptability**: The ability to "keep learning and growing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:16">[00:51:16]</a> and "adapt faster than competition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:23">[02:23:23]</a> is crucial for sustained relevance and success. This includes being "okay with not knowing everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:27">[02:23:27]</a>.
*   **Persistence and Resilience**: Not giving up after setbacks, whether it's a poor audition or a bad game, is a defining characteristic of those who succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:19">[00:56:19]</a>.
*   **Defining Your Own Success and Peace**: True peace comes from making choices aligned with personal desires, rather than external validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:48">[02:44:48]</a>. Kriti's "happy restless phase" means she is at peace with her current state while still having ambition for growth, free from insecurity or fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:06">[02:21:06]</a>.
*   **The Power of Self-Belief**: Ultimately, having a "some sort of belief that you know you can" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:48">[02:44:48]</a> is essential in navigating the highly competitive landscapes of their industries. This includes recognizing and trusting one's own talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:37">[01:03:37]</a>.
*   **Personal Support Systems**: While professional challenges are constant, a stable personal life, whether through family or a partner, provides a crucial "safe space" and grounding, helping to remain focused and cope with external pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:32">[03:13:32]</a>. This highlights the importance of [[balancing_personal_and_professional_life | balancing personal and professional life]].

The discussions reveal that while talent and external opportunities play a role, the ability to continually learn, adapt, and persevere through inner and outer challenges is paramount.

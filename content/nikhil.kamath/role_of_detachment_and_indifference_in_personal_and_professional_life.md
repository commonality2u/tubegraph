The concept of detachment and indifference is explored through a personal lens, revealing its origins, impact, and evolving nature in an individual's life. Initially described as a coping mechanism, it has influenced both personal relationships and professional resilience.

## Origins of Detachment
The guest, Ranbir, attributes his detachment and indifference to early [[attachment_styles_and_psychological_analysis | childhood experiences]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>. He recalls a faint memory from age four or five where a friend leaving caused intense internal pain, leading him to "close up" and "detach myself from everybody" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>. This ingrained quality is further supported by the host's observation that Ranbir seems to be "avoidant attached" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.

## Personal Impact
Ranbir's experiences with his father also contributed to his emotional reserve. His father's volatile temperament instilled a sense of fear, making him "always on the edge" and causing him to be disturbed by louder tones from childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. This upbringing led him to stop crying at a very early age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:39">[00:33:39]</a>. He admits to not having cried when his father passed away, experiencing a panic attack instead of grief, and feeling [[personal_challenges_and_resilience_in_career | guilt]] for not being able to express affection or weakness towards his father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>.

He noted that therapy did not work for him, partly because he found it difficult to "completely honestly express myself" and felt the therapist was teaching him to "manipulate life" rather than genuinely address issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:35:36]</a>. He confesses to being "very scared of opening myself up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:44">[00:36:44]</a>.

Despite his outward persona, Ranbir admits to still being [[attachment_styles_and_psychological_analysis | attached]] while simultaneously pretending to be [[attachment_styles_and_psychological_analysis | detached]] and even convincing himself of this detachment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>.

## Professional Impact
In his professional life, this detachment has manifested as a resilience to public perception. Despite being labeled a "Casanova" and a "cheater" for a significant part of his career, he states it used to bother him only because it affected his parents. He eventually realized he was "just a commodity" and that external opinions didn't matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:49">[00:54:49]</a>. He doesn't take success or failure in films to extremes, viewing a successful film as temporary until the next one, and a failure as an opportunity to "try harder again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:17">[01:16:17]</a>. This balanced outlook helps him navigate the "many heartbreaks" inherent in the film industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:01">[01:48:01]</a>.

## Evolution of Detachment
The birth of his daughter, Raha, has been a significant "game changer" that is making him "question Detachment and indifference" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>. He describes the feeling of holding his newborn daughter as having "somebody's kind of taking a your heart out and just put it in your hand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>, indicating a profound emotional shift. This new life has also led him to rethink his previous acceptance of an earlier death age, now wishing for more years to live for his daughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>.

His relationship with his wife, Alia, is characterized by deep friendship and open communication, where they can "chat, laugh" and she makes him "smile" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>. This strong bond, solidified during the COVID-19 lockdown, has potentially softened his detached tendencies, especially as she was very supportive during his father's illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:16">[01:00:16]</a>. He acknowledges that Alia has made significant efforts to change for him, like modifying her loud tone of voice, which had rattled him due to his past experiences with his father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:11">[00:58:11]</a>. This willingness to adapt for a partner suggests a lessening of previous rigid detachment in his personal [[life_lessons_and_personal_development | life lessons and personal development]].

The early life of the speaker was shaped by his upbringing in Vadnagar, a small town in the Maisana district of North Gujarat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. His village, part of the former Gaekwad State, emphasized education, with amenities like a pond, a post office, and a library <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

## Childhood Experiences

Born in Gujarat, the speaker grew up in Vadnagar, a town with a population of approximately 15,000 during his childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. His village was characterized as a "cow strait" of the Gaekwad State <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. He attended a primary school built by the Gaekwad State <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. The village pond was a significant part of his youth where he learned to swim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, often washing family clothes to earn permission to go there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. He later attended Narayanacharya High School, also known as B.N. High School, which was a charitable institution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>, completing his education up to the 11th standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

During his childhood, he encountered a local Congress leader and socialist, Lover Bhai Dave Kar, who encouraged children to find written stones in the ancient village <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. This activity, initially a pile of stones, instilled in him an understanding that "some story hidden in every stone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

## Academic Performance and Interests

The speaker describes himself as a "very average student" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a> who didn't attract much attention academically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. His teachers, particularly Velji Bhai, had high expectations of him, seeing "so much talent" but noting his lack of focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. He admits to having no interest in exams, viewing them merely as a means to "pass it brother, take it out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. He preferred other activities and possessed an ability to "instant catch" anything new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

Despite his academic indifference, he was inspired by his physical training (PT) teacher, Mr. Parmar, who encouraged him to learn exercises like wrestling and stool pillars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. He would wake up at 5:00 AM to train with his teacher, who dedicated significant effort to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>. However, he clarified he was "not a player" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a> and eventually ceased these activities.

## Language and Social Interaction

The speaker is a South Indian who primarily grew up in Bangalore, with his mother's city being Mysore, where Kannada is commonly spoken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. His father was from near Mangaluru <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. He learned Hindi in school but noted a lack of fluency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. His command over mathematics was also limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. He believes that communication is largely non-verbal and that understanding others through observation is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. He improved his Hindi speaking skills by interacting with milk traders from various provinces who frequented the railway station where he sold tea as a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:12">[01:51:12]</a>.

## [[Impact of childhood and family on personal growth | Family Influence]] and [[Personal reflections and life choices | Early Departure from Home]]

The speaker's upbringing instilled in him a principle of "Nation First" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>. He stated that his mother, despite being uneducated, taught him profound lessons, notably, "Work smart. Live a life of purity" when he sought her blessings before becoming Chief Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:47">[01:18:47]</a>.

He left home at a very young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>, resulting in a significant gap in his contact with family and childhood friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. He felt "no reason to even feel" attachment due to this separation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:53">[01:17:53]</a>.

## [[Challenges and failures in career | Early Challenges]] and [[Adversity and its role in success | Learnings]]

The speaker states that his life was not "created" by him but by "circumstances" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>. He views his challenges as his "biggest university" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a> and has "fallen in love with trouble" because it taught him so much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. Witnessing women in his home state walk three kilometers for water sparked his desire to address such issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:12">[00:32:12]</a>. His mantra in public service is based on three principles: hard work, selflessness, and not making mistakes with bad intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>.

One of his first [[challenges in the education system | setbacks]] was the inability to attend a Sainik School <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:24">[01:03:24]</a>. Despite passing the interview and exam, his father could not afford the fees, leaving a lasting regret that he "couldn't even do that in life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:14">[01:03:14]</a>. This marked his "first setback" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>.

Another unfulfilled wish was to lead a saintly life by joining the Ramakrishna Mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:48">[01:03:48]</a>. He met Swami Atmasthanand Ji, but due to the Mission's rules, he did not "sit for that qualification" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:11">[01:04:11]</a>. Despite the unfulfilled dream, he was not disappointed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:31">[01:04:31]</a>, believing destiny led him on a different path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:52">[01:04:52]</a>.

The speaker has consistently lived "outside the comfort zone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>, which he believes has taught him how to live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:10">[01:07:10]</a>. He considers himself "unfit for comfort" because his background meant even small achievements brought satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:40">[01:07:40]</a>. He attributes failures in life to people becoming "addicted to" their comfort zones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:18">[01:08:18]</a>. He believes that to progress in any field, one must take risks and remain outside their comfort zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:50">[01:08:50]</a>. His own risk-taking ability is driven by his disinterest in personal gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:31">[01:09:31]</a> and a "zero fear" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:12">[01:10:12]</a>.

He recounted an incident from his time with the RSS where he, a novice driver, turned off a jeep engine on a slope to save petrol, causing the vehicle to lose control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:50">[01:05:50]</a>. Despite the near-accident, those with him were unaware of his mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:25">[01:06:25]</a>. This taught him the importance of learning from mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:31">[01:06:31]</a>, as life experiences "take more handling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:46">[01:06:46]</a>.

He used to dedicate time each year to travel to remote, uninhabited places for self-reflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:09">[01:11:09]</a>. During one such trip in the 1980s, attempting to stay in a desert, he got lost but was helped by a Muslim gentleman who housed him in the last village before the Pakistan border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:23">[01:12:23]</a>. This experience of "spiritual feeling" in a "white run" desert, contrasting with his Himalayan experiences, later inspired him to develop the area into a major tourist destination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:27">[01:14:27]</a>.

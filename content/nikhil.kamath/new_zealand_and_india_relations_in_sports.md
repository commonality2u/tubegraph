Relations between New Zealand and India extend to the realm of sports, notably [[cricket_between_india_and_new_zealand | cricket]]. An India-New Zealand [[cricket_between_india_and_new_zealand | cricket]] final was recently attended by one of the speakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. The mention of this match by a guest prompted a light-hearted, yet notable, reaction from the host, who remarked that the podcast was "going so well" until the match was brought up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.

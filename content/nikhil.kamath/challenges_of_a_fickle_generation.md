A significant flaw identified within a [[challenges_and_mindset_of_the_modern_youth | generation]] is its [[challenges_and_mindset_of_the_modern_youth | fickle]] nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This observation emerged during an attempt to establish what people in the particular [[thinking_of_young_generation_in_India | generation]] are thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. It was also noted that the four individuals discussing this topic might not be fully representative of their current area or the broader generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

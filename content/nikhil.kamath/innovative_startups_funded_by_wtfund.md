The WTFund is a [[nondilutive_grant_for_young_entrepreneurs | non-dilutive grant]] established to support young founders aged 25 and under who possess great ideas but lack the financial resources to execute them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This initiative began by inviting individuals to allocate money or time to support the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

The fund received 1,500 applications, which were then narrowed down to a shortlist of 160, before finally presenting the first nine startups selected for funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

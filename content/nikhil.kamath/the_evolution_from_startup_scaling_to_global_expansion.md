The journey of OYO, as shared by its founder, exemplifies the rapid evolution from a local startup to a globally recognized brand, highlighting both the successes and significant challenges faced during periods of intense scaling and international expansion.

## Early Growth and Initial Scaling in India

OYO's growth began in India, starting from a few hotels in one city to becoming one of the most prominent hotel brands in the country within the economy and economy-plus segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:31">[03:46:31]</a>. The initial idea, conceptualized by the founder, focused on providing accommodation with standardization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:06">[03:29:06]</a>.

This early scaling was supported by initial capital. LightSpeed, an investor, provided 3.5 crores at an 8 crore valuation in 2013-2014, a substantial amount that instilled a sense of accountability in the founder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:51">[03:59:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:02">[03:40:02]</a>. The business experienced significant growth from 2014 to 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:31">[03:46:31]</a>.

## Global Expansion and the "Pains of Growth"

By 2019, OYO began its global expansion, transitioning from an Indian brand to a globally prominent one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:49">[03:46:49]</a>. This included managing a large portfolio of 150,000 holiday homes in Europe across countries like Denmark, Netherlands, and Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:57">[03:46:57]</a>. The company raised over a billion and a half dollars during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:04">[03:48:04]</a>.

However, this rapid expansion also brought "pains of growth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:49">[03:48:49]</a>. A key challenge was the natural economics of the business: while 90% of hotels were revenue-share and highly margin-accretive, the remaining 10% that were minimum-guarantee hotels drove most of the losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:53">[03:49:53]</a>. The management bandwidth was strained by the extensive spread of the business, leading to the realization that they had grown "more than we should have" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:08">[03:50:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:11">[03:50:11]</a>.

## Navigating the COVID-19 Impact and Consolidation

The onset of COVID-19 presented unprecedented challenges. The year before COVID, OYO grew by 300% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:32">[03:53:32]</a>, but with the pandemic, 65% of revenue evaporated overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:48">[03:53:48]</a>. This meant the company had to fund a majority of its operations through external financing, despite being a shrinking business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:54">[03:53:54]</a>.

Talent retention became a significant issue, as recruiters from other tech companies offered 2-3x salary jumps to OYO's technology personnel, who were fungible across industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:45">[03:54:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:56">[03:54:56]</a>. This period, particularly one year, was described as one of the toughest for the operator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:12">[03:55:12]</a>.

However, this challenging period transformed the company's thinking and operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:21">[03:55:21]</a>. OYO became comfortable being a "30% growth company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:27">[03:55:27]</a>, prioritizing clear metrics such as consumer rating, merchant revenue, and margin expectations over aggressive growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:35">[03:55:35]</a>. This period accelerated the adoption of these perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:53">[03:55:53]</a>.

## Key Learnings for Entrepreneurs

The journey of OYO and its founder offers several [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_challenges | key learnings]] for aspiring entrepreneurs:

*   **Admitting Mistakes Early** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:55">[03:50:55]</a>: It is crucial for business leaders to admit mistakes, as it allows for authentic conversations and helps avoid concealing issues that can lead to a more isolated and uncorrectable path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:10">[03:51:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:19">[03:52:19]</a>.
*   **Resilience and Sangfroid** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:03">[03:56:03]</a>: The ability to "get punched" and remain calm, bouncing back quickly without overreacting, is a significant precursor to [[success_factors_for_entrepreneurs | success]] in any startup journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:07">[03:56:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:23">[03:56:23]</a>.
*   **Taking Criticism Effectively** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:44">[03:56:44]</a>: Differentiating between constructive criticism and mere "noise" is vital. Constructive criticism can be valuable, while noise should not stick, allowing one to remain unbothered by baseless speculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:09">[03:57:09]</a>.
*   **Perseverance** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:59">[03:16:59]</a>: Staying committed for long periods of time, even when there are many reasons to give up, is the number one trait for entrepreneurial success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:59">[03:16:59]</a>.
*   **Optimism and Awareness of Cyclicality** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:22">[03:41:22]</a>: Maintaining an optimistic outlook about the future while being aware that things will change (both positively and negatively) helps in preparing for challenging times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:50">[03:42:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.
*   **Delaying Gratification** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:25">[03:09:25]</a>: Being comfortable with delaying personal gratification for long-term goals, such as wealth creation, despite immediate social pressures or temptations, is a key [[traits_of_successful_founding_teams_and_companies | trait of successful entrepreneurs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:42">[03:09:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:22">[03:14:22]</a>.
*   **Humility and Self-Confidence** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:05">[03:19:05]</a>: It is possible to be both self-confident (in one's ability to build a successful business) and humble (recognizing limitations and being open to learning and accepting others' contributions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:23">[03:19:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:25">[03:20:25]</a>. This humility also fosters approachability and allows for continued growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:34">[03:21:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:01">[03:22:01]</a>.
*   **Contrarian Thinking** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:29">[02:59:29]</a>: As a startup is fundamentally built against convention, having an opinion that differs from the majority and being able to pursue it is highly valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:57">[02:59:57]</a>. This "rebel without a cause" mindset is common among successful entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:01">[03:01:01]</a>.

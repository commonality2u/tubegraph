This article explores the concepts of [[leadership_and_personal_values | leadership and personal values]] within the realm of politics, drawing comparisons with entrepreneurship and offering insights into the philosophy guiding public service.

## Parallels Between Politics and Entrepreneurship

The discussion begins by attempting to draw [[parallels_between_politics_and_entrepreneurship | parallels between Politics and Entrepreneurship]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. It is noted that both fields share many similarities, which have not been widely discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

## Qualities for Political Success

Becoming a politician is one aspect, but being successful in politics is another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>. Key qualities identified for success include:
*   **Dedication and Commitment**: A politician needs to be dedicated and committed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.
*   **Empathy and Partnership**: One must be a partner in people's happiness and sorrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>.
*   **Team Player**: A successful politician is fundamentally a good team player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>.
*   **Mission-Driven Approach**: Good people should continue to enter politics, driven by a mission rather than just ambition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>. Mission should always supersede ambition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>.
*   **Authenticity**: Success comes from living one's life authentically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>.
*   **Sensitivity**: Politicians need to be sensitive, not thick-skinned, to truly serve people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:28">[00:37:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>.
*   **Conviction**: The ability to convince others stems from self-experience and genuine emotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:13">[01:54:13]</a>.

> [!info] The Power of Experience
> The speaker notes that communication is most effective when it comes from self-experience. "When you let things out from within you... there is no experience in what you are saying... Convincing comes in when you are with someone... Talking About the Sad Thing so do you feel sad at that yes you saw" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:54">[01:53:54]</a>.

### Mission Over Ambition
The [[role_of_mission_versus_ambition_in_politics | role of mission versus ambition in politics]] is crucial. Mahatma Gandhi is cited as an example of a leader who embodies a mission-driven approach, despite not fitting conventional definitions of a powerful politician <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>. Gandhi never contested elections nor sought power, yet his place of remembrance is Rajghat, a symbol of national reverence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>.

## Philosophy on Life and Personal Growth

The speaker's [[philosophy_on_life_and_personal_growth | philosophy on life and personal growth]] is deeply rooted in personal experiences and challenges.
*   **Life as a Teacher**: Life itself serves as the biggest university, with problems being the greatest teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>.
*   **Embracing Difficulty**: A love for "trouble" teaches a lot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. Witnessing the struggles of others, such as women walking long distances for water, fuels a desire to serve and address societal problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:12">[00:32:12]</a>.
*   **Mantra for Public Life**: The speaker's life mantra in public service is based on three tenets:
    1.  Lack no effort in hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>.
    2.  Do nothing for personal gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>.
    3.  Acknowledge mistakes, but never act with bad intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:18">[00:33:18]</a>.
*   **Nation First**: The core belief system is "Nation First" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:24">[00:35:24]</a>, which serves as the unchanging criteria for all decisions, including letting go of old traditions and adopting new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>.
*   **Learning from Failures**: Setbacks are crucial for shaping one's personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:02">[01:05:02]</a>. The speaker views their entire life as having been lived outside their comfort zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>, finding comfort in challenges. This willingness to take risks is attributed to a complete lack of self-care or personal ambition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:37">[01:09:37]</a>.

## Personal Journey and Political Involvement

The speaker's [[involvement_in_politics | involvement in politics]] and public life began at a young age, leading to a unique perspective on [[transition_from_business_to_politics | transition from business to politics]] (though not directly from business in this case, but from a non-traditional background).
*   **Early Life**: Born in Vadnagar, Gujarat, a small town with a strong emphasis on education provided by the Gaekwad State <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Childhood activities included swimming in the village pond and washing clothes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   **Leaving Home**: The speaker left home at a very young age, losing touch with childhood friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. As Chief Minister, a desire arose to reconnect with all classmates to reinforce the message that the speaker remained the same person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.
*   **Honoring Teachers**: A deep respect for teachers led to a public honoring ceremony for all teachers from childhood through schooling after becoming CM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. This was seen as a message that teachers contribute to shaping who a person becomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.
*   **Family Connection**: A similar gathering was arranged for family members, many of whom were unknown due to the speaker's long absence from home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.
*   **Serving Those Who Helped**: Even families who had provided meals during earlier life journeys were invited and honored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.
*   **Humility in Success**: Despite high office, the speaker remains grounded, noting that they often don't "feel distance" from people of any area or age group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>.
*   **Early Setbacks**: Two significant early setbacks include:
    1.  Not being able to attend a Sainik School due to financial constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:52">[01:01:52]</a>.
    2.  Being refused entry into the Ramakrishna Mission due to not meeting their specific qualifications, despite a desire for a saintly life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:48">[01:03:48]</a>. These experiences, though disappointing, did not lead to despair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:31">[01:04:31]</a>.

## Challenges and Evolution in Politics

The speaker addresses [[challenges_in_changing_perceptions_about_politics | challenges in changing perceptions about politics]] and the evolving political landscape.
*   **Perception of Politics**: The idea that politics is "dirty" is deeply ingrained in society, making it difficult to encourage good people to join <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:46">[00:56:46]</a>. However, politics is fundamentally about public service and positive change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:57">[02:03:57]</a>.
*   **Role of Money**: It is asserted that money is not a prerequisite for successful political involvement. An example is given of a doctor who successfully campaigned by collecting one rupee from individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:03">[02:11:03]</a>. Patience and dedication are far more important than financial resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:08">[02:12:08]</a>.
*   **Beyond Elections**: Politics is not just about winning elections or attaining power; it encompasses a broader engagement with social life and policy-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:22">[02:22:22]</a>.
*   **Social Media's Impact**: Social media has empowered democracy by allowing for easy verification of information, helping people get closer to the truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:40">[01:41:40]</a>. It has also fostered new interests, such as the public's engagement with space missions like Chandrayaan and Gaganyaan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:07">[01:43:07]</a>.
*   **Dealing with Criticism**: An anecdote about an Ahmedabad driver who doesn't "take" abuse illustrates the approach to dealing with public criticism: if one is truthful and has no ill intent, accusations do not cause harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:54">[01:38:54]</a>.

## Vision for India and Youth Involvement

The speaker envisions a future India driven by aspirational youth and emphasizes the importance of [[youth_involvement_in_politics | youth involvement in politics]].
*   **Inspiring Youth**: The goal is to motivate young, smart Indians to enter politics and be inspired by a life of public service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>.
*   **Nation First**: The guiding principle for all action is "Nation First" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>.
*   **Addressing Aspiration**: Every Indian youth today has aspirations, and the government aims to fulfill them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:48">[01:41:48]</a>.
*   **Empowering Through Technology**: Initiatives like India Stack, UPI, and Aadhaar have democratized technology, enabling direct benefit transfers and eliminating corruption, serving as examples to the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:22">[01:31:22]</a>.
*   **Risk-Taking and Innovation**: The government encourages risk-taking and innovation, seeing the youth as key to the country's development. A separate innovation commission and fund have been established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:56">[01:32:56]</a>.
*   **Global Perception**: India's global perception has significantly improved, with Indians abroad being seen as law-abiding and educated citizens, contributing to the country's rising profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:08">[01:36:08]</a>.
*   **Call to Action**: Young people are encouraged to enter public life in any form, not just through elections, and bring "creativity" and new thinking to leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:01">[02:04:01]</a>. The speaker's aim is for new talent to emerge across all political parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:31">[02:05:31]</a>.

## Evolution of Leadership (PM Terms)

The speaker reflects on the evolution of their leadership approach across different terms as Prime Minister:
*   **First Term**: Focused on understanding Delhi and being understood by the people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:31">[01:57:31]</a>.
*   **Second Term**: Broadened perspective beyond immediate achievements, focusing on the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:42">[01:57:42]</a>.
*   **Third Term**: Characterized by increased courage, expanded dreams, and a stronger desire to achieve the vision of a developed India by 2047 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:56">[01:57:56]</a>. The focus is on 100% delivery of services and benefits without discrimination, embodying true social justice and secularism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:30">[01:58:30]</a>. The driving force is "Aspirational India" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:18">[01:59:18]</a>.

The speaker also focuses on preparing the next generation of leaders for the country, indicating a long-term vision beyond their own tenure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:07">[02:00:07]</a>.

## Desired Qualities for Youth in Politics

For a young person aspiring to become a politician, it is essential to possess discernible talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. The ideal entry into politics is characterized by a "mission, not ambition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, emphasizing the importance of good people continually entering the political sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Challenges and Perceptions

A significant hurdle for youth considering a career in politics stems from deeply ingrained societal perceptions. Growing up in a South Indian middle-class family, it was a common teaching from childhood that "politics is a dirty place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This negative view has become deeply ingrained in the collective psyche, making it very difficult to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This perspective presents a challenge for encouraging the [[thinking_of_young_generation_in_India | young generation in India]] to participate in politics.

## Encouraging Youth Involvement

The critical question remains: what can be done to alter these perceptions and encourage greater participation from individuals who have been raised with such negative views of politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>? Addressing this ingrained skepticism is crucial for fostering a new generation of leaders.

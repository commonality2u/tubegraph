New Zealand and India share a relationship that extends beyond official diplomatic ties, encompassing cultural and people-to-people connections. The Prime Minister of New Zealand, Chris Hipkins, brought the largest delegation of any New Zealand Prime Minister to India, which included a community delegation and an indigenous M훮ori performing arts (kapahaka) team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Mutual Appreciation for Culture

There is a significant appreciation for culture in both countries. Indians demonstrate a "huge appreciation" for their own culture, which is described as thousands of years of "incredibly mesmerizing and interesting" civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Similarly, there is "huge respect for M훮ori culture" in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This mutual respect serves as a great way to foster connections at a human and people-to-people level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

The M훮ori performing arts group, known as kapahaka, showcases the culture of the M훮ori, who are the indigenous people of New Zealand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. An instance of this cultural exchange was the performance of the haka at an Indian parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. The New Zealand kapahaka team was also expected to perform in front of the Taj Mahal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

## Sporting Bonds

Cricket is a notable point of connection between the two nations, despite the competitive nature of their matches. The [[cricket_between_india_and_new_zealand | India-New Zealand cricket final]] was mentioned as a recent event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. A specific example of the cross-cultural link in cricket is Ajaz Patel, a New Zealander who is also referred to as a "son of Mumbai" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

## Outward-Looking Approach and Deeper Relationships

New Zealand is characterized as an "outward-looking people," with approximately one-fifth of its population living overseas at any given time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>. This openness encourages welcoming people and fosters connections to deepen relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. The belief is that deeper relationships lead to bigger results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:20">[00:23:20]</a>. The Prime Minister expressed a desire for a closer, deeper, and broader relationship between [[new_zealand_and_india_relations_in_sports | New Zealand and India]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

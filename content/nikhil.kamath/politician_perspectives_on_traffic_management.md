Discussions with politicians have shed light on their views regarding law enforcement and traffic management, particularly concerning [[bangalore_traffic_issues | Bangalore traffic issues]].

## Relationship with Law Enforcement

One politician noted that the new commissioner "doesn't listen to any of us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a> and "does whatever he wants" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This indicates a perceived lack of influence politicians might have over law enforcement operations, including traffic enforcement. The autonomy of the commissioner affects how [[leadership_and_politics | leadership]] is exercised within the police force and potentially influences the [[public_perception_of_politics | public perception of politics]] concerning governance and rule enforcement.

The question was also raised whether politicians are found among those who "break the signal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, implying potential issues of accountability or influence related to traffic violations.

## Challenges and Solutions in Bangalore

When discussing [[traffic_management_and_solutions_in_bangalore | traffic management and solutions in Bangalore]], it is commonly observed that despite efforts to highlight positive aspects of the city, "people tell me traffic, traffic, traffic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Addressing these challenges involves identifying "What is the problem?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a> and "What is the solution?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The conversation points towards the need for [[longterm_solutions_for_bangalore_traffic | long-term solutions for Bangalore traffic]] problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

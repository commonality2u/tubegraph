The advent of [[the_impact_of_ai_on_future_work | AI]] is projected to significantly alter the future of work and, consequently, the amount of leisure time available to individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This shift is anticipated to free up substantial time, potentially leading to earlier retirements and shorter work weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Rethinking the Purpose of Time

Such a transformation will necessitate a [[philosophical_perspectives_on_life_and_survival | philosophical rethink]] on how time should be spent, especially when traditional work obligations diminish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The fundamental question arises: what will individuals do if they no longer have to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>? The concept of early retirement, such as at age 40, might not be as radical as it once seemed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. However, the idea of never needing to work presents a profoundly different societal structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Human Nature and Social Structures in a Leisure-Rich Future

Despite potential increases in leisure, human nature suggests a continued inclination towards hierarchy and segregation, even if not through current structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The notion of pure communism, where everyone is completely equal, is described as an "unnatural behavior for humans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This implies that even with abundant free time, new forms of social organization and differentiation may emerge.

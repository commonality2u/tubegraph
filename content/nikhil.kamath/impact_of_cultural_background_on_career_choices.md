The cultural background and upbringing of individuals significantly influence their career paths, particularly in unconventional fields. This influence extends from parental expectations and the values instilled during childhood to the direct support and challenges encountered.

## Parental Influence and Expectations

Both Kriti Sanon and Rahul, who pursued careers in acting and cricket respectively, highlight the strong influence of their parents, who were both academics (professors and a CA).

*   **Academic Pressure and Support**:
    *   Kriti Sanon, as a firstborn, felt intense pressure to excel academically, aiming for 90% or higher grades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Her mother, a Physics Professor, actively tutored her in math and instilled a strong drive for achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. Kriti initially chose engineering not knowing what it entailed, but was drawn to computer science and physics, the latter influenced by her mother's teaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.
    *   Rahul's parents, also professors, were supportive of his passion for cricket but imposed a strict condition: his grades could not drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:56">[01:14:56]</a>. This dynamic of parental support contingent on academic performance was similar for Kriti, who even took a GMAT entrance exam while trying for films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:18">[01:15:18]</a>.
    *   Badshah's background also involved parents in government and teaching professions, and he pursued a civil engineering degree after college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:24">[01:44:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:42">[02:08:42]</a>.

*   **Vicarious Living and Unfulfilled Dreams**:
    *   Kriti's mother, a pioneer as the first woman in her family to work and pursue a PhD, projected her unfulfilled dreams onto Kriti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. She pushed Kriti to learn Kathak dancing from age five, recognizing her talent and wanting to develop it into a skill, despite Kriti initially disliking classical dance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. This highlights how parental aspirations, shaped by their own [[overcoming_challenges_and_personal_stories_in_careers | challenges]], can guide a child's initial exposure to certain fields.
    *   Similarly, Rahul's father, who had to give up cricket to pursue other obligations, was never against Rahul playing, indicating a desire for his son to pursue what he couldn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:37">[01:14:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:47">[01:14:47]</a>.

## Personal Traits and Societal Norms

Upbringing also shapes personality traits and how individuals navigate professional environments.

*   **Shyness to Confidence**: Kriti Sanon describes herself as a shy, studious, and nerdy child with stage fright <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Her initial modeling shoots and ramp walks left her crying due to consciousness and not performing her best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:51">[03:53:51]</a>. However, through persistent exposure to uncomfortable situations in the industry, she gained confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:47">[04:41:47]</a>, embodying the idea that [[overcoming_challenges_and_personal_stories_in_careers | overcoming challenges]] builds strength.
*   **Adaptability and Learning**: The entertainment industry, particularly in India, is seen as competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Kriti emphasizes the importance of evolving and molding oneself to changing times and being open to learning, even asking "stupid" questions without insecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:42">[02:22:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:10">[02:23:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:25">[02:23:25]</a>. This adaptability is crucial for long-term [[the_concept_of_making_it_in_offbeat_careers | success]] and relevance.
*   **Cultural Context of Industries**: The discussion touches upon the Indian film industry (Bollywood) and its financial challenges, with lower multiplex occupancy rates and reduced profitability compared to five years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>. The importance of data-driven decisions versus emotion-oriented ones is also debated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:40">[01:10:40]</a>, reflecting [[cultural_differences_in_professional_environments | broader challenges and experiences in traditional and nontraditional career paths]].

## [[The role of personal relationships and family dynamics in shaping ones life | The Role of Personal Relationships]]

The panelists' views on relationships also shed light on cultural background:

*   **Family as a Core Unit**: Kriti's family is a central part of her identity, and she makes collective decisions with them, especially concerning finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:09">[02:07:09]</a>. While she sees herself as an individual professionally, her family features in her mental image of the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:48">[02:07:48]</a>.
*   **Relationships and Stability**: Rahul highlights the importance of a supportive partner as a "safe space" and an "escape," providing stability and focus in a demanding career, especially in contrast to being single <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:29">[02:31:29]</a>. This reflects the value placed on strong personal relationships in certain cultural contexts.
*   **Societal Constructs vs. Personal Beliefs**: The host questions the necessity of traditional societal constructs like marriage for a relationship to be "wonderful," preferring not to subject relationships to "a bunch of rules" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:57">[02:33:57]</a>. This indicates a potential divergence from traditional views on relationships, even within a cultural context that emphasizes family.

## [[Influence of upbringing on achievements | Influence of Upbringing]] and [[The role of passion and talent in career success | Talent in Career Success]]

The guests discuss the interplay of inborn talent, persistence, and external factors:

*   **Nature vs. Nurture**: Rahul emphasizes natural talent in cricket, citing hand-eye coordination and the ability to judge ball speed and bounce as innate qualities that cannot be fully acquired through practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:15">[01:03:15]</a>. He aligns with the "nature" side of the debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:48">[01:05:48]</a>, stating that some abilities are gifts that cannot be taught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:36">[01:05:36]</a>.
*   **Passion and Diligence**: Kriti initially fell in love with acting after starting, emphasizing that while she wasn't necessarily born with the "want," her diligence helped her become good at it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:10">[02:15:10]</a>. This suggests that while talent can be innate, passion can also be developed through experience and competence. Badshah believes that [[the_role_of_passion_and_talent_in_career_success | true passion]] for music is a prerequisite for long-term [[the_concept_of_making_it_in_offbeat_careers | success]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:17">[02:13:17]</a>.
*   **Persistence and Patience**: All three guests highlight persistence and patience as crucial virtues for success in their respective fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:55">[02:13:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:26">[02:36:26]</a>. Jay-Z's quote, "The only genius thing that I did was not giving up," resonates with Badshah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:37">[02:13:37]</a>.

## [[Challenges and experiences in traditional and nontraditional career paths | Challenges in Non-Traditional Careers]]

Entering and staying relevant in unconventional careers involves unique [[challenges_and_experiences_in_traditional_and_nontraditional_career_paths | challenges]]:

*   **Lack of Legacy**: Kriti highlights the difficulty of breaking into the industry without a "legacy" or connections, requiring a decade to reach her current standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:10">[01:19:10]</a>.
*   **Financial Independence**: Rahul, anticipating a significant dip in earnings after his cricket career, started investing and learning about business during COVID-19. His parents couldn't provide this specific guidance, underscoring the need for personal [[negotiating_career_decisions_and_offers | financial planning]] when [[transitioning_to_offbeat_careers | transitioning]] from short-shelf-life careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:27">[02:18:27]</a>.
*   **Relevance and Evolution**: Musicians and actors face the challenge of staying relevant in a rapidly changing environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:30">[02:22:30]</a>. The ability to adapt and be open to learning is key to sustained success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:38">[02:23:38]</a>.

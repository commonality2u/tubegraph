The Live Love Laugh (LLL) Foundation, led by Anisha Padukone, is a non-governmental organization dedicated to addressing [[mental_health_and_wellbeing | mental health]] awareness and stigma in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The foundation was formally launched in Mumbai in October 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Genesis and Mission of Live Love Laugh Foundation

The LLL Foundation was established by its founder, Deepika Padukone, following her personal journey with anxiety and depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Her experience highlighted two significant issues in India: a severe lack of awareness regarding [[mental_health_and_wellbeing | mental health]] and substantial stigma associated with mental illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Padukone publicly shared her story on National Television in December 2014, a moment described as a watershed for [[mental_health_and_wellbeing | mental health]] in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

LLL aims to address these issues systematically and sustainably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. The organization's core belief is that "no life should be lost due to mental illness," given that India has one of the highest suicide rates globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. Its vision is to provide hope to individuals experiencing stress, anxiety, and depression, especially during times when they feel hopeless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

## Addressing Diverse Audiences

LLL's strategy for addressing [[mental_health_and_wellbeing | mental health]] challenges across India's diverse population is based on three key areas:
*   **Awareness** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>
*   **Accessibility** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>
*   **Affordability** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>

All LLL programs and initiatives are designed to fall within these three pillars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. The organization tailors its programs and initiatives based on the target audience, utilizing appropriate vehicles and mediums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. For urban dwellers who are social media consumers, digital platforms are the preferred method of outreach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

## [[Challenges of mental health outreach in rural India | Challenges in Rural Outreach]]

Reaching individuals in rural India presents unique [[challenges_of_mental_health_outreach_in_rural_india | challenges]] compared to urban areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Lack of Understanding**: Mental illness is often not understood, similar to the situation in urban India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Superstitious Beliefs**: There is a prevalence of belief in faith healers, black magic, and similar practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   **Severe Manifestations**: Instances of mental illness can be more severe, with individuals exhibiting aggressive behavior and sometimes being physically restrained (chained to beds or trees) due to lack of understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
*   **Inadequate Mediums**: Digital platforms like social media are not effective for reaching rural populations, such as a 45-year-old man in a village <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

To overcome these [[challenges_of_mental_health_outreach_in_rural_india | challenges]], LLL employs a community-based model for its rural programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Instead of an individualistic approach, they focus on supporting, making aware, and empowering the larger community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. The first rural visit by LLL's founder and trustees took place in Davangere in October 2017 to commemorate World Mental Health Day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## Achievements and Impact

For LLL, the most fulfilling achievements are the individual transformations witnessed in people's lives, whether in rural or urban settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. The team is often approached by unknown individuals who share how LLL helped them through difficult situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. Stories of beneficiaries from rural programs are particularly transformational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. These personal stories of success are considered more significant than awards or other recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

LLL's first school program session was held at The Thea School Sapphire High School in Bangalore, where awareness was created for adolescent students and their teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

The organization plans to use recent funds of 75 lakh rupees to [[scaling_mental_health_programs_in_india | scale its rural mental health program]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. This program has been running since 2016, and its established model allows for broader expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

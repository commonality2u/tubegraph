The topic of [[introduction_to_artificial_intelligence | Artificial Intelligence]] (AI) often begins with fundamental questions: "what is AI" and "how did we get here" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Key Questions in Understanding AI

When discussing AI, a core objective is to understand its current state and potential [[future_directions_of_ai | future developments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This includes addressing the concept of a "godfather of AI" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a> and considering the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) within the broader scope of AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Current Perspectives: Large Language Models (LLMs)

Large Language Models (LLMs) are a prominent topic in current AI discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. However, it has been stated that LLMs are not considered "the path to human level intelligence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## The "Godfather of AI"

The term "godfather of AI" evokes a specific image, especially given cultural connotations where "godfather" might suggest belonging to a mafia in some contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This highlights the varied perceptions and societal associations that can arise when discussing influential figures in the [[history_and_evolution_of_ai | history of AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

The concept of the [[metaverse | metaverse]] sparks curiosity, with many seeking a clear [[definition_of_metaverse | definition]] of what it entails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Current Digital Universes

Today, individuals already "disappear into a different universe" based on their tastes and interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This behavior, sometimes referred to as the "metaversal habit," is already prevalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

Examples include:
*   **Lifestyle Universe** Opening Instagram to explore what people are eating or where they are going creates a "universe of lifestyle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   **Thoughts and Opinions Universe** Logging into social networks like Koo or Twitter immerses users in a "world of thoughts and opinions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

While people are already logging into these universes, they are currently "two-dimensional" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The experience becomes more "meta" as it gets more immersive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Being engrossed in a phone is considered a "metaversal experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, indicating that the behavior is already present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## Origin of the Term

The word "[[metaverse | metaverse]]" is a "made-up name" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Its origin can be traced back to:
*   **Snow Crash (Book)** A novelist, whose name is not recalled in the transcript, wrote a book called *Snow Crash* approximately 20-30 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This book described a version of the [[metaverse | metaverse]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   **Ready Player One (Movie)** A decade ago, the movie *Ready Player One* depicted a scenario where users "put something in" to access a virtual world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   **The Matrix (Movie)** Similar to *Ready Player One*, *The Matrix* portrays a world where individuals "get plugged into this world via some device" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, transforming their physical location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

These examples suggest that a core aspect of the true [[metaverse | metaverse]] involves being "transformed into another location" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Defining the Immersive Experience

While current phone usage involves logging into various "universes," the commonly accepted [[definition_of_metaverse | definition]] of the [[metaverse | metaverse]] emphasizes a "three-dimensional" experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

> "The first picture that comes at least the way it's being sold and told is also you were the ex-india CEO of meta yeah and insta so yeah so the way I look at it nikhil is it's defined as something which is three-dimensional and virtual and [[virtual_reality_and_augmented_reality | augmented reality]] and [[virtual_reality_and_augmented_reality | virtual reality]] and all of those buzzwords" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>

Experiences with [[devices_and_technology_in_the_metaverse | devices]] like Oculus can be "pretty amazing," giving a true sense of immersion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. However, concerns exist regarding the bulkiness and cost of such [[devices_and_technology_in_the_metaverse | devices]], with newer versions costing around $400 or $500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. These high-cost, bulky [[devices_and_technology_in_the_metaverse | devices]] are currently suited for "very few Elite experiences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

The aspiration for the [[metaverse | metaverse]] is a world where even everyday [[devices_and_technology_in_the_metaverse | devices]] like phones or browsers can provide a "three-dimensional feel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

During a discussion centered on [[entrepreneurship_and_startup_success | entrepreneurship]] and what makes a [[entrepreneurship_and_startup_success | startup success]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, an observation was made regarding the psychological impact of rapid financial gain.

## The Self-Perception of the Rapidly Wealthy

It is suggested that individuals who accumulate significant wealth very quickly may harbor subconscious self-hatred or a general disdain for the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This statement emerged amidst a broader conversation about the characteristics of an entrepreneur, including the value of being contrarian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a> and the importance of risk-taking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The comment highlights a potential psychological paradox associated with quick wealth accumulation.

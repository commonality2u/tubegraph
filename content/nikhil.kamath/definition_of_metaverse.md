The term "[[metaverse | metaverse]]" is a made-up word <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. It originates from a book titled *Snow Crash*, written 20 to 30 years ago, which depicted a version of the [[metaverse | metaverse]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Core Concepts

At its core, the [[metaverse | metaverse]] implies a shift from two-dimensional digital experiences to more immersive ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

#### Current Digital Universes

Currently, individuals already "disappear" into different digital universes based on their interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. For example:
*   **Lifestyle Universe**: Platforms like Instagram allow users to explore content related to what people are eating or where they are going <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   **Thoughts and Opinions Universe**: Social networks such as Koo or Twitter serve as platforms for engaging with thoughts and opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

These existing experiences, while providing immersion, are primarily two-dimensional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

#### Immersive Experiences

The concept of the [[metaverse | metaverse]] is often associated with experiences where a user's physical location is transformed into a virtual one via a device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This idea has been depicted in media such as the movie *Ready Player One* and *The Matrix* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

While some define the [[metaverse | metaverse]] as primarily three-dimensional and involving [[virtual_reality_and_augmented_reality | virtual reality]] and [[virtual_reality_and_augmented_reality | augmented reality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>, others suggest a broader interpretation:
*   **Phone as a Universe**: Logging into a phone is considered a universe in itself, with each application acting as a distinct universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Increasing Immersiveness**: The more immersive a digital experience becomes, the more it aligns with the concept of the [[metaverse | metaverse]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. The widespread behavior of people focusing intently on their phones is already considered a "metaversal experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

#### Devices and Technology

Devices like Oculus can provide highly immersive experiences, leading users to feel truly transformed into another location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. However, some question whether bulky, expensive devices like Oculus are the primary path forward for the [[metaverse | metaverse]], suggesting that a more accessible, three-dimensional "feel" through devices like phones or browsers might be more impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

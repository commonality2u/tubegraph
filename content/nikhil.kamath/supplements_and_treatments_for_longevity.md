The discussion around [[longevity_and_health | longevity]] often involves different approaches, including supplements and medical treatments. A "three-point medicine approach" is suggested to be a more systemic, whole-body strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Longevity Supplements

Participants in the discussion acknowledge that they are "all taking different things" related to [[Health supplements and their efficacy | longevity supplements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. However, one participant explicitly states they are "not taking anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Specific Treatments

A growth hormone was mentioned as something found in a bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. The idea of seeking specific treatments, such as in Dubai, for particular issues is also raised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## Important Disclaimer

It is explicitly stated that listeners should not take any of the discussed substances or follow any dietary advice mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## The "Don't Die" Framework

A philosophical framework called "Don't Die" is introduced, which is described as an economic plan, political, moral, and social <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This framework includes principles such as "don't kill each other" and "don't kill the planet," and suggests aligning AI with this "don't die" principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The concept humorously extends to extreme hypothetical scenarios, such as needing to "eat Bran's heart" for personal survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

The journey into unconventional careers, such as acting, cricket, or music, is often deeply influenced by an individual's upbringing, familial dynamics, and the kind of support or pressure they received during their formative years. For many, childhood experiences and parental expectations play a significant role in shaping their ambitions and resilience.

## Kriti Sanon: From Studious to Stardom

Kriti Sanon describes herself as a "shy and a studious and a nerdy kid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. As a firstborn, she felt the [[influence_of_personal_upbringing_on_professional_success | pressure]] to excel in studies, aiming for over 90% in grades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Her mother, a professor, and father, a CA, instilled this academic discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Kriti initially suffered from stage fright <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>, a surprising revelation given her current profession.

However, her mother recognized an inherent talent for dance at age five <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a> and enrolled her in Kathak classes, despite Kriti disliking classical dance at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Kriti now acknowledges this as a crucial "base training" that provided her body with rhythm and grace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>, a skill she utilizes today.

Her mother's competitive nature, stemming from her own [[importance_of_family_and_upbringing_in_shaping_perspectives | upbringing]] where she had to fight to pursue her PhD and be the first woman in her family to work, influenced Kriti's drive for perfection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. Kriti believes her mother's unfulfilled dreams of learning singing and swimming were projected onto her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

Despite family concerns about the pressure of science, Kriti chose engineering due to her genuine interest in computer science and physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. She never felt compelled to work for money, attributing this to her middle-class upbringing and her parents' financial support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>. This allowed her to pursue her passion rather than solely financial gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>.

Kriti's path to acting was serendipitous, starting with modeling after someone suggested it due to her height <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:37">[00:52:37]</a>. She only realized her passion for acting after performing in a TV commercial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:56">[00:53:56]</a>, initially crying after her first ramp show and photoshoot due to self-consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>. Her mother initially expressed concern about her entering a field that requires "thick skinned" individuals, contrasting Kriti's shyness with more confident actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:31">[00:55:31]</a>. However, Kriti persisted, gaining [[challenges_and_failures_in_career | confidence]] through work and continuous learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:47">[00:41:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>. She stresses the [[impact_of_childhood_and_family_on_personal_growth | importance]] of recognizing one's skill and developing it into a passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:11">[00:54:11]</a>.

## Rahul: Cricket and a Professor's Son

Rahul grew up in Mangalore, a small town, where his parents were also professorsâ€”his father in geology and his mother in Indian history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:12">[00:57:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:46">[00:57:46]</a>. He describes his childhood in a massive engineering college campus where his schooling took place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:16">[00:58:16]</a>.

His [[impact_of_childhood_and_family_on_personal_growth | love for cricket]] began at two and a half or three years old, constantly playing and asking his father to throw balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:47">[00:58:47]</a>. His father, who had played cricket in college but had to give it up due to parental restrictions, was supportive of Rahul's passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:27">[01:14:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:37">[01:14:37]</a>. However, his parents maintained a strict condition: if his grades dropped, he would be pulled out of cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:56">[01:14:56]</a>. This echoes Kriti's experience with academic pressure.

Rahul's delayed entry into formal cricket coaching at age 11, after years of pestering his father, made him appreciate the opportunity even more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:16">[01:02:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>. He believes [[influence_of_personal_upbringing_on_professional_success | inherent talent]] is crucial in sports, differentiating those who make it to higher levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:15">[01:03:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:48">[01:05:48]</a>. Rahul states that one's legacy or parents' professions do not significantly impact success in cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>.

Rahul's [[personal_reflections_and_life_choices | reliance]] on his family for financial guidance is evident. He did not come from a family that had prior experience in investing, and he had to learn about it himself, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, to ensure his [[wealth_and_its_impact_on_life_choices | financial future]] post-cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:52">[02:18:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:02">[02:19:02]</a>. He finds solace and stability in his family, particularly his partner, which helps him stay focused amid the pressures of his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:10">[02:27:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:16">[02:27:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:32">[02:31:32]</a>.

## Badshah (Aditya): The Unconventional Artist

Aditya, known as Badshah, was born in Delhi; his father worked for the government electricity board, and his mother was a teacher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:24">[01:44:24]</a>. He attended Bal Bharti Public School and later St. Stephen's College before going to Punjab Engineering College for civil engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:07">[01:45:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:20">[01:45:20]</a>.

His [[impact_of_peer_and_environment_on_learning_and_development | musical journey]] began with Punjabi music, followed by Bollywood, and then an introduction to rap in school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:35">[01:45:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:49">[01:45:49]</a>. He started writing as a way to express himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:36">[02:01:36]</a>, which later evolved into rhyming and songwriting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:59">[02:01:59]</a>. He initially used the name "cool equal" as an email ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:29">[01:41:29]</a>, but later consciously chose the name "Badshah" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:40">[01:40:40]</a>, showcasing [[the_significance_of_naming_and_identity_in_careers | self-definition]] in his career.

Badshah describes himself as a very emotional person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:01">[01:42:01]</a>. He believes that the desire to perform is what drives an artist to give their all to the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:54">[01:42:54]</a>. His first major break came from collaborating with Honey, whom he wrote for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:17">[02:08:17]</a>. Significantly, he was a government officer (subdivisional officer) operating tunnel and water canal gates in Himachal Pradesh right after college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:29">[02:08:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:53">[02:08:53]</a>. He only transitioned to music after realizing his passion and potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:23">[02:09:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:33">[02:09:33]</a>. His first independently produced song, "Saturday Saturday" (2012), became a local hit and was later picked up by Dharma Productions for a movie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:12">[02:10:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:32">[02:10:32]</a>. He advises aspiring musicians to pursue music only if they are truly passionate about it, and to be original <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:17">[02:13:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:27">[02:35:27]</a>.

## Key Learnings

Across these diverse career paths, several common themes regarding the [[influence_of_personal_upbringing_on_professional_success | impact of upbringing and familial support]] emerge:

*   **Parental Expectations and Pressure:** All three individuals experienced some form of parental expectation, primarily academic, which instilled discipline and a drive for excellence.
*   **Early Recognition of Talent:** Parents played a crucial role in identifying and nurturing early talents, whether it was dance for Kriti or cricket for Rahul.
*   **Supportive Environment (with conditions):** While parents were generally supportive of unconventional dreams, they often had conditions, particularly regarding education, to ensure a backup plan.
*   **Finding Passion:** For some, passion is innate (Rahul), while for others, it develops through experience and self-discovery (Kriti, Badshah). This is often linked to realizing one's aptitude in a field.
*   **Resilience and Persistence:** The ability to overcome [[challenges_and_failures_in_career | setbacks]] and continue pursuing goals, often despite initial failures or external doubts, is highlighted as critical.
*   **Financial Security and Choices:** A stable financial background from parents provided a cushion, allowing them to pursue careers driven by passion rather than immediate financial necessity. This [[wealth_and_its_impact_on_life_choices | financial independence]] later translates into making career choices based on excitement and artistic fulfillment.
*   **Impact on Personality:** Upbringing shapes personality traits like shyness, studiousness, and emotional expressiveness, which then evolve as individuals navigate their chosen careers.
*   **The "Why":** A core message is that pursuing an unconventional career should stem from genuine love and passion for the craft, not solely for fame or [[wealth_and_its_impact_on_life_choices | wealth]].

The journey into unconventional careers, such as acting, sports, or music, is significantly shaped by an individual's [[background_and_upbringing_in_shaping_entrepreneurial_outlook | upbringing]] and early life experiences. These foundational years can influence personality, ambition, and the development of key skills, ultimately guiding career paths.

## Kriti Sanon: From Shy Student to Actor

Kriti Sanon describes her early life as a "shy and a studious and a nerdy kid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. As a firstborn, she felt pressure to excel in studies and be a "good kid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Her mother was a professor and her father a CA, which instilled a strong emphasis on achieving high grades, often 90% or above <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Kriti even experienced stage fright as a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

Despite her studious nature, Kriti's [[family_influences_on_personal_development | mother recognized]] an "inherent thing" for dance when Kriti was around five years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Even though Kriti "used to really hate coming back from school and my mom dragging me 45 minutes to 1 hour away to learn Kathak," her mother insisted because she saw Kriti's talent and wanted to develop it into a skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. This classical training later provided a fundamental "base" for rhythm and grace that she uses in her acting career today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

Kriti's mother, a physics professor, was significantly involved in her studies and life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>, teaching her physics and contributing to Kriti's interest in the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:49]">[01:10:49]</a>. The drive for academic excellence stemmed from her mother's own [[the_impact_of_childhood_adversity_on_success | experiences]]: she was the first woman in her family to work and "fought to do PhD" because her parents held a more conservative view that she should "just get married" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:02]">[01:11:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:16]">[01:11:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:26]">[01:11:26]</a>. This suggests that Kriti's mother may have vicariously lived some of her own unfulfilled dreams through her daughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53]">[00:09:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:05]">[01:12:05]</a>.

Kriti chose engineering, liking computer science and physics, despite her mother's concern about the "pressure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:04]">[01:13:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08]">[01:13:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:08]">[01:14:08]</a>. She attributes her current confidence to her [[professional_challenges_and_setbacks | work experiences]] and actively seeks situations that challenge her, noting that "scary and exciting is the same emotion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:47]">[01:41:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:06]">[01:42:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:58]">[01:42:58]</a>.

## Rahul: Cricket from Childhood Obsession

Rahul's [[background_and_upbringing_in_shaping_entrepreneurial_outlook | upbringing]] in Mangalore, a small town, laid the foundation for his cricket career. Both of his parents were professors; his father taught geology, and his mother was a lecturer in Indian history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:46]">[00:57:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:52]">[00:57:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00]">[00:58:00]</a>. His father worked at an engineering college, and their family lived on the massive campus where his schooling also took place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:19]">[00:58:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:33]">[00:58:33]</a>.

Rahul's love for cricket began very early, with his father noting he picked up a bat at "2 and a half, 3 years old" and would make him throw balls "nonstop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:47]">[00:58:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:50]">[00:58:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:57]">[00:58:57]</a>. He was a good student but excelled in sports, playing every sport offered in school, including football, volleyball, swimming, and athletics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:08]">[00:59:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:16]">[00:59:16]</a>. This multi-sport engagement, including daily beach activities, helped him develop strong athletic ability that later benefited his cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:32]">[00:59:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:41]">[00:59:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:04]">[01:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51]">[01:00:51]</a>.

By age seven or eight, he was "really obsessed with cricket" and repeatedly asked his father to enroll him in a summer camp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:24]">[01:01:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:26]">[01:01:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:30]">[01:01:30]</a>. His father initially hesitated, feeling he was "too young" or "too skinny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02]">[01:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:13]">[01:02:13]</a>. When he finally started cricket coaching at age 11, he immediately stood out and was picked for the academy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:21]">[01:02:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:29]">[01:02:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:44]">[01:02:44]</a>.

His parents were supportive, with his father having played cricket in college before giving it up due to his own parents' restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:27]">[01:14:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:37]">[01:14:37]</a>. However, they were "very strict about education," conditioning their support on his grades not dropping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:56]">[01:14:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:01]">[01:15:01]</a>. Rahul considers himself lucky to have "only had one dream" and never needed a Plan B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:45]">[01:35:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:53]">[01:35:53]</a>. This singular focus and gratitude for his blessings are deeply ingrained, leading him to regularly visit temples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:02]">[01:36:02]</a>.

## Badshah (Aditya): From Government Job to Music Star

Born Aditya, Badshah grew up in Delhi with a father in a government job (Delhi Electricity Board) and a mother who was a teacher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:24]">[01:44:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:28]">[01:44:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:32]">[01:44:32]</a>. He attended Bal Bharti Public School <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:07]">[01:45:07]</a> and was a good student <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:15]">[01:45:15]</a> before pursuing civil engineering at Punjab Engineering College <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:20]">[01:45:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:23]">[01:45:23]</a>.

His early exposure to music began with Punjabi music from his mother and Bollywood songs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:35]">[01:45:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:43]">[01:45:43]</a>. He was introduced to rap in school by a friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:49]">[01:45:49]</a>. The shift to the name "Badshah" was a conscious decision, reflecting a desire to be "cool" and perform on stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00]">[01:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:27]">[01:42:27]</a>.

After college, he initially took a government job as a Sub-Divisional Officer at the Bhakra Beas Management Board in Himachal Pradesh, operating water canal gates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:42]">[02:08:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:50]">[02:08:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:02]">[02:09:02]</a>. This seemingly conventional path was coupled with his growing passion for music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:58]">[02:03:58]</a>. He started writing lyrics because he "couldn't express" himself otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:36]">[02:01:36]</a>, and this evolved into rhyming and songwriting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:59]">[02:01:59]</a>.

His significant break came when he met Honey, an underground artist in Chandigarh, and began writing for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:22]">[02:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:37]">[02:07:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:20]">[02:08:20]</a>. Even while working his government job, he was pursuing music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:26]">[02:08:26]</a>. He believes that true passion for music is essential for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:17]">[02:13:17]</a>. He advises aspiring artists to "be original" and to "not give up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:27]">[02:35:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:11]">[02:36:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:19]">[02:36:19]</a>.

## Key Influences and Lessons

*   **Parental Influence & [[family_influences_on_personal_development | Family Background]]**: Parents' professions, aspirations, and values significantly shape a child's early development and perceived career options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:46]">[00:57:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:24]">[01:44:24]</a>. Parental support, even with conditions, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:06]">[01:15:06]</a>.
*   **Early Talent Recognition**: Identifying and nurturing inherent talents from a young age can lay a strong foundation for future careers, even if the child initially resists formal training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55]">[00:06:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:47]">[00:58:47]</a>.
*   **Developing Confidence**: Overcoming early shyness or lack of confidence often involves repeatedly putting oneself in uncomfortable situations and learning through experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:47]">[01:41:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:06]">[01:42:06]</a>.
*   **Passion vs. Talent**: There's a debate on whether [[influence_of_talent_vs_passion_in_career_success | passion leads to talent]] or vice-versa. It's suggested that realizing one is "good at something" can ignite passion, or that an initial passion can be honed through hard work to achieve skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:19]">[01:53:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:35]">[01:53:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:42]">[01:53:42]</a>.
*   **[[transition_from_childhood_to_career_in_a_business_family | Transitioning into Unconventional Careers]]**: The path often involves initial conventional education (like engineering) followed by a pivot to a passion, often driven by a singular focus or a serendipitous opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:18]">[01:15:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:45]">[01:35:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:26]">[02:08:26]</a>.
*   **Continuous Learning and Adaptability**: To stay relevant, especially in dynamic fields, one must always be open to learning, asking questions, and adapting faster than the competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:42]">[02:22:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:16]">[02:23:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:23]">[02:23:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:27]">[02:23:27]</a>.

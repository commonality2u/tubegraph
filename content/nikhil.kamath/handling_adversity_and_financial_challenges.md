## The Impact of Childhood Adversity
Many entrepreneurs find that early life challenges, especially those related to finances, significantly influence their later success and [[the_impact_of_childhood_adversity_on_success | personal growth]].

### Gazal's Journey
Gazal's foundational experiences with financial hardship began in her childhood. When she was about 12 or 13 years old, her father's family business experienced a significant split, leading to him being burdened with substantial debt, estimated at 40 to 50 lakhs at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. This unforeseen event caused her confident father to break down and enter a period of depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

Her mother, who had been a homemaker, stepped up with immense courage, selling her gold savings to provide capital for the business and even taking tuitions to support the family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. This experience instilled in Gazal the conviction that "money only comes home when the business makes profit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

Her mother's conviction that "this is not going to define the rest of our lives" became a guiding principle for Gazal, fueling her [[resilience_in_adversity | resilience]] and belief that challenges can be overcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. The feeling of helplessness during her father's struggles subconsciously linked money with happiness, driving her desire for financial independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>. She actively sought to earn her own money from a young age, starting with tuitions in college, driven by her mother's advice: "Till the time you're taking money from anybody else, whoever you are taking it from will make decisions for you. The day you start earning your own money is the day you get to choose where to spend it on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>.

### Manish's Story
Manish's childhood was marked by humble beginnings in a bustling textile market in Bombay, where luxuries like a color TV were not common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:13">[01:15:13]</a>. His father also experienced a business separation from his brother, forcing him to start over, though Manish was too young to consciously grasp the full impact at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:46">[01:15:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:39">[01:16:39]</a>.

By the age of 18, Manish found himself taking over his father's business after another family split <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:08">[01:28:08]</a>. His first major independent deal, a 25 lakh order from Bangladesh, quickly turned into a 50 lakh claim due to quality issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:59">[01:44:59]</a>. This early setback taught him the importance of quality control and not repeating mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:05">[01:47:05]</a>.

A significant challenge came when he took a 37 crore loan to build a factory in Bangalore, having only about 10 crores to his name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:02">[02:06:02]</a>. This immense [[professional_challenges_and_setbacks | financial risk]] caused him stress and a period of depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:34">[02:08:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:56">[02:12:56]</a>. Despite the difficulties, his father's unwavering trust, similar to Gazal's mother, was a key motivator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:11">[02:05:11]</a>.

## Strategies for Overcoming Challenges

### Relentless Pursuit and Adaptability
Manish's journey highlights his relentless pursuit of opportunities and adaptability. He built connections, learned the intricacies of the textile and garment industry, and was willing to "bend his back" without ego to achieve his goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:56">[01:47:56]</a>. When faced with the decline of his European export business, he redirected his energy to create his own brand, Rare Rabbit, focusing on the untapped "smartwear" segment in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:17">[02:14:17]</a>. His approach to distribution also adapted to the challenge of not securing mall space by starting with an online presence, showcasing his flexibility and determination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:36">[02:34:36]</a>.

### Optimism and Perseverance
Ritesh emphasizes the importance of optimism and perseverance when facing setbacks. He believes that "things will change, either positively or negatively," and that one must always be an optimist about the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:22">[03:41:22]</a>. His personal experiences, from being suspended from school to navigating the severe impact of COVID-19 on OYO (with 65% revenue evaporation overnight) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:49">[03:53:49]</a>, reinforced his belief in the cyclical nature of success and failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:01">[03:41:01]</a>.

He highlights the critical need for [[resilience_in_adversity | perseverance]], especially for young entrepreneurs, as there are "so many reasons to give up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:57">[03:16:57]</a>. He learned to be okay with social pressure and not let criticism "get one layer under your skin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:06">[03:17:06]</a>, advising others to ignore noise and focus on constructive criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:09">[03:57:09]</a>.

Ritesh also learned the importance of admitting mistakes early. He believes that saying "mea culpa" is crucial for business leaders because it allows for authentic conversations and helps prevent problems from escalating into unmanageable "ego problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:55">[03:50:55]</a>.

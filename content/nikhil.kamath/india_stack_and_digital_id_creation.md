## Genesis of the India Stack

The individual, Nandan, explored and understood the broad journey of the [[india_stack_and_digital_infrastructure|India Stack]] from the perspective of a young person around 20-25 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The approach to building within this framework was focused on the long term, akin to "marathon runners" rather than "sprinters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Digital ID Implementation

The government initially requested the creation of a unique ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Nandan specifically made this unique ID digital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This decision stemmed from a genuine belief that digital technology, when used appropriately, has the potential to significantly improve people's lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The unique digital ID project is understood to be the foundational element of what later became [[aadhaar_and_digital_id_implementation|Aadhaar]].

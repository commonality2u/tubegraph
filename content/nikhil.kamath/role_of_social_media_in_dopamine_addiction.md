Social media platforms can create a "vicious cycle" driven by a dopamine response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This cycle provides a "dopamine hit" at both ends of the interaction: from the platform's side and from the individual user's side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The act of posting personal content, such as holiday pictures, and the desire for others to see them, contributes to this cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

Technology and data play an increasingly crucial role in modern healthcare, enabling personalized approaches and systemic analysis.

## Data Ownership and Wearable Technology
Major technology companies are emerging as significant owners of health-related data. For instance, [[opportunities_in_wearable_technology_and_healthrelated_devices | Apple]] and Samsung are identified as large owners of health data, primarily due to their [[opportunities_in_wearable_technology_and_healthrelated_devices | smartwatches]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Personal data collection is also evident, with one speaker identifying himself as "the most measured person in human history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## AI in Healthcare
The future of healthcare AI is dependent on robust data infrastructure. For [[emerging_technologies_and_innovations_in_india | India]] to advance and become relevant in [[future_of_ai_and_technology | healthcare AI]], it will require its own dedicated data sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

### Ethical Considerations for AI
A philosophical framework known as "don't die" is proposed, which encompasses economic, political, moral, and social aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This framework suggests that AI should be aligned with the principle of "don't die," meaning it should not lead to self-destruction or planetary destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The core rules of this framework include not killing each other and not destroying the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Systemic and Personalized Health Approaches
A "three-pointer approach" in medicine advocates for a more systemic, whole-body perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This includes consideration of various health interventions, such as:
*   Longevity supplements, which many individuals are reportedly taking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   Specific treatments like growth hormone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
*   The desire for targeted, effective treatments for specific health issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## Mental Health
There is an acknowledgment that [[AI and Healthtech Innovations for Mental Health | mental health help]] is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

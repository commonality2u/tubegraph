The landscape of politics and public communication has undergone significant changes, particularly with the advent and pervasive influence of social media. Leaders who have experienced both pre-social media and modern political eras offer unique insights into these shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:02">[00:38:02]</a>.

## The Evolving Role of Social Media

Social media's importance in politics has drastically increased over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:15">[00:38:15]</a>. It has emerged as a "huge power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:09">[00:41:09]</a>, transforming how politicians interact with the public and how information is disseminated and verified.

### Social Media as a Tool for Verification and Democracy

Before the rise of modern digital platforms, information was less easily verifiable. For example, claims about fatalities might have been accepted without immediate means of checking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>. Today, with "everything available in a mobile phone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:47">[00:41:47]</a>, individuals can "come closer to the truth very comfortably" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>. This capability strengthens democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a> and allows for the exposure of wrongdoing <a class="yt:timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>.

The rise of social media has also fostered a new spirit in the youth, leading to increased interest and knowledge in areas like space exploration, with many young people following developments like Gaganyaan and the activities of astronauts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:12">[00:43:12]</a>.

### Managing Public Scrutiny and Criticism

Public figures in the age of social media face constant scrutiny, including trolling and abuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:13">[00:37:13]</a>. One approach to handling such negativity is to view it as something "given" but not necessarily "taken" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:53">[00:53:53]</a>. However, it's emphasized that politicians need to be "very sensitive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a> in public life to genuinely serve people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:58">[00:40:58]</a>. The importance of integrity, being "on the ground of truth," and having "no sin in your heart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:13">[00:40:13]</a> is highlighted as a way to navigate accusations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>.

### Communication Skills in Politics

Beyond technology, effective communication remains a core skill for politicians. This includes the "art of speech" (oratory) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a> and non-verbal communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Genuine self-experience and allowing feelings to naturally emerge contribute to convincing and impactful delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:54">[01:53:54]</a>.

### India's Global Perception and Technology

The perception of India has significantly changed globally, partly due to strategic efforts to leverage the strength of the Indian diaspora worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:45">[01:36:45]</a>. This positive shift is also attributed to India's advancements in technology, such as the unified payment interface (UPI) and direct benefit transfers (DBT) via Aadhaar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:22">[01:31:22]</a>. These technological implementations have democratized access to services, reduced corruption, and garnered international admiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. The country's increasing global credibility means that its statements, especially in times of crisis, are trusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:11">[01:43:11]</a>.

The younger generation in India is now less focused on leaving the country for education or careers, preferring to "build in India" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:40">[01:38:40]</a>, indicating a major change in national aspiration. The rise of [[social_media_career_transitions | startups]] in India, initially seen as "apocalypse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:47">[01:56:47]</a>, has gained credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:58">[01:56:58]</a>.

## Encouraging Youth Participation

There is a strong call for young people to enter politics, not merely for elections or power, but to contribute to public life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:57">[02:03:57]</a>. This includes engaging in policy-making to bring about nationwide change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:30">[00:58:30]</a>. The goal is to purify politics by having good people join <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:57">[00:55:57]</a>. Political life is not easy; it demands dedication, commitment, and being a partner in people's joys and sorrows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>. Good people should enter politics with a "mission" rather than just ambition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>.

The desire to see India as a developed nation by 2047 drives current political thought, aiming for 100% delivery of government benefits without discrimination, which is seen as true social justice and secularism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:15">[01:58:15]</a>. This vision emphasizes empowering citizens to claim their rights, rather than begging for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:44">[01:58:44]</a>. Future leaders are also being prepared, with a focus on nurturing talent for the next 20 to 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:10">[02:00:10]</a>.

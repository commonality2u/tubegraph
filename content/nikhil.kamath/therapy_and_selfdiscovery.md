## Emotional Expression and Vulnerability
The speaker admits to not expressing themselves or crying frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This difficulty in showing emotions is a significant aspect of their personal journey.

## Experiences with Therapy
Although the speaker has tried therapy and states they have nothing against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, they find it challenging. The main obstacle is the need to "open myself up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, as they are "very scared of owning myself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

An interviewer suggests viewing therapy as a "gym for the mind" that helps one "perform better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Identity and Public Perception
The speaker notes that a part of their identity was shaped by being labeled a "Casanova" or "cheater" for a large part of their life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. They also shared that they dated two very successful actresses simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, which became a defining part of their identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## Family Dynamics and Influence
The speaker describes their father as a "short-tempered man" but a "good man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. They recall being submissive, always responding with "yes" and never saying "no" to their father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The birth of their daughter, Alia, is viewed as a significant event, with the speaker considering Alia "a part of her with me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

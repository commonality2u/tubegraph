Today, individuals commonly "disappear" into different digital universes based on their interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. For instance, accessing the "lifestyle universe" involves opening Instagram to see what people are eating or where they are going <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Similarly, for "thoughts and opinions," users log into social networks like Koo or Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Current Digital Universes on Smartphones
Users are already logging into these digital universes, but they are currently [[current_digital_universes_on_smartphones | two-dimensional]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. A phone, with its various applications, is considered a universe in itself, where each app represents a distinct universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. The more immersive these experiences become, the more they lean towards being [[metaverse | meta]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This "[[understanding_the_metaverse | metaversal]] habit" of logging off from physical reality and engaging with screens is already prevalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Towards a Three-Dimensional Metaverse
The common [[definition_of_metaverse | definition of the metaverse]] envisions it as a [[technology_and_virtual_reality | three-dimensional]] environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. This concept often includes elements of [[virtual_reality_and_augmented_reality | virtual reality]] and [[virtual_reality_and_augmented_reality | augmented reality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

### Oculus and Immersive Experiences
Devices like the Oculus offer experiences that can be "pretty amazing," giving users a sense of being truly immersed in another environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. These experiences range from fitness to music applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

### Challenges with Current Hardware
Despite their immersive potential, current [[technology_and_virtual_reality | VR devices]] like the Oculus face [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_the_vr_and_ar_space | challenges]]:
*   **Bulkiness** These devices can be cumbersome to wear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   **Cost** They are relatively expensive, with newer versions costing around $400-$500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Limited Accessibility** They are currently suited for a "very few elite experiences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

### The Future of Mobile Technology
The [[the_future_of_social_media_and_technological_advancements | future of the metaverse]] may involve phones, browsers, or apps evolving to provide a [[technology_and_virtual_reality | three-dimensional]] feel, rather than requiring specialized, bulky and expensive hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. This indicates a potential shift towards more accessible and integrated [[technology_and_virtual_reality | technological advancements]] for [[understanding_the_metaverse | metaverse]] engagement.

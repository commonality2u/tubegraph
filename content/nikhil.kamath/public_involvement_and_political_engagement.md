Public involvement and active political engagement are recurring themes, emphasizing the importance of participation over passive observation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Encouraging Engagement

There is a strong encouragement for individuals to [[challenges_and_realities_of_influencing | get involved]] in the political arena rather than remaining on the sidelines. The sentiment is that while it's easy to comment from behind a keyboard, genuine impact comes from actively participating and "giving it a go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

> "My request to them would be get involved. You know, that's what I've tried to do. You can sit on the sidelines and you can comment and get behind your keyboard and sound off, but otherwise get into the arena and actually give it a go." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>

## Generational Outlook

An observation is made about younger generations, specifically those born beyond 1995 or 2000, noting that they may not share the same optimism regarding the future as previous generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This lack of optimism highlights a potential barrier to [[youth_in_politics | youth involvement in politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Personal Stance on Politics

The speaker is frequently asked about the possibility of entering politics but currently has no intention of doing so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Observation of Political Figures

An instance of a [[political_figures_and_media_representation | Member of Parliament]] performing the Haka in parliament was noted as a memorable event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

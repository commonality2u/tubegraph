This article explores the journeys of three individuals who have forged successful paths in unconventional careers: acting, cricket, and music. The discussion delves into their upbringing, the challenges they faced, their mindset towards success, and the advice they would offer to aspiring individuals in similar fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

## Kriti Sanon: From Shy Student to Accomplished Actor

Kriti Sanon describes her early life as a "shy and a studious and a nerdy kid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. As the firstborn, she felt pressure to excel in studies, aiming for over 90% in exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Her mother, a professor, and her father, a CA, instilled this academic drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Kriti also suffered from stage fright, which surprises people given her current profession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

### Early Discoveries and Parental Influence
Despite her shyness, Kriti had a natural talent for dancing. Her mother noticed her dancing skills at age five and enrolled her in Kathak Kendra at Mundy House <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. Though Kriti initially "really hate[d]" classical dance, she is now grateful for the foundational training it provided, which gives her body "that Rhythm and that Grace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

Her mother's competitive nature stemmed from her own life, where she had to "fight for a lot of dreams" she wanted to achieve, including pursuing a PhD, as women in her family typically didn't work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Kriti believes her mother's drive was also influenced by her own unfulfilled desires, such as learning to sing or swim, which she was not allowed to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

Kriti pursued engineering, initially drawn to computer science, without fully understanding the profession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. She excelled academically due to intense self-imposed pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.

### Evolution in Her Career
Kriti's confidence grew with her work. She recalls crying after her first ramp show and photo shoot because she felt she wasn't performing her best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>. By continuously putting herself in uncomfortable situations, she gained confidence and learned to surpass her fears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>. She now views scary and exciting as the "same emotion" professionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:58">[00:42:58]</a>.

She attributes her success to a combination of [[importance_of_passion_and_persistence_in_creative_industries | persistence]], hard work, talent, and destiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:42">[00:47:42]</a>. As an outsider in the industry, she had to figure out what kind of roles and films she truly enjoyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>. She now chooses roles that excite her, prioritizing creative satisfaction over box office numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>.

Validation, while important, should not come at the "cost of Peace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:35">[00:33:35]</a>. After a decade in the industry, Kriti feels less need to prove herself, instead focusing on pushing her boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>. She describes her current phase as "happy restless," where she is content with her achievements but still ambitious for what's next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>.

Kriti is a "learner" who isn't afraid to ask "too many questions" on set, believing it's crucial for evolving and growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:44">[00:49:44]</a>. She notes that while initially perceived negatively, this quality is now appreciated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:35">[00:50:35]</a>.

### Advice for Aspiring Actors
*   **Find Your Passion**: Kriti emphasizes the importance of loving what you do or being good at it and developing that into a passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:19">[00:53:19]</a>.
*   **Don't Give Up**: Even after setbacks, "still have the courage to get up and give it another shot and then give it another shot till you become good at it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:16">[00:56:16]</a>.
*   **Embrace Evolution**: As an actress, she acknowledges the finite nature of her career arc, noting the need to transition to roles that suit her age and experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:06">[02:20:06]</a>.

## KL Rahul: The Cricketer's Journey to Self-Awareness

KL Rahul grew up in Mangalore, a small town where both his parents were professors â€“ his dad in geology and his mom in Indian history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:12">[00:57:12]</a>. He developed a love for cricket at a very young age, picking up a bat at two and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:47">[00:58:47]</a>.

### Balancing Academics and Sport
Rahul was a decent student, maintaining an 80-90% average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:08">[00:59:08]</a>. His parents were supportive of his cricket aspirations but had strict conditions: "the minute we see that your grades are dropping we will pull you out of cricket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:56">[01:14:56]</a>.

### The Role of Talent and Environment
Rahul believes in the inherent nature of talent in sports, specifically "hand eye coordination" and the ability to judge the ball's speed and bounce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:15">[01:03:15]</a>. He argues that some abilities are "gifted" and "can't be taught" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:32">[01:05:32]</a>. However, playing multiple sports helped him develop overall athletic ability, which he believes is crucial for long-term success in cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:32">[00:59:32]</a>.

The path to becoming a professional cricketer involves progressing from school teams to academy teams, then state teams, and eventually senior levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:30">[01:38:30]</a>. More exposure to games and challenges aids development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:11">[01:39:11]</a>.

### [[personal_challenges_and_resilience_in_career | Overcoming challenges in offbeat careers]] and Mindset
Rahul had to contend with significant trolling after an interview, which "scarred [him] massively" and led him to withdraw socially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:57">[01:27:57]</a>. He has since adopted a strategy of staying off social media to manage its negative impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:46">[01:32:46]</a>.

Rahul's mindset on the field is to "not worry about the outcome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:41">[01:24:41]</a>. He finds that his best performances come when he maintains this calm approach, recognizing that internal pressure can hinder performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:57">[01:25:57]</a>.

Rahul, like Kriti, emphasizes the finite nature of his career due to age and physical demands. Around age 30, he started seeing "the end of the tunnel" in his cricket career, leading to anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:34">[02:17:34]</a>. This realization prompted him to start researching businesses and investing to ensure financial security post-retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:27">[02:18:27]</a>.

### The Importance of Relationships and Support
Rahul highlights the importance of his relationship with his partner, describing her as his "safe space" who keeps him grounded, regardless of his performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:48">[02:31:48]</a>. He believes that stability in relationships helps maintain focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:06">[02:32:06]</a>.

## Badshah: From Engineer to Music Mogul

Badshah, whose real name is Aditya, was born in Delhi. His father worked for the government electricity board, and his mother was a teacher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:24">[01:44:24]</a>. He was a good student, attending Bal Bharti Public School and later Punjab Engineering College for civil engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:07">[01:45:07]</a>.

### The Genesis of a Musician
Badshah was introduced to rap in school by a friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:49">[01:45:49]</a>. He started writing because he "couldn't Express" himself otherwise, eventually rhyming things and developing his lyrical skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:36">[02:01:36]</a>. This began from singing along to music and a desire for "validation" and to "be cool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:22">[02:02:22]</a>.

His passion for music led him to explore mixing and production, initially learning through software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:58">[02:03:58]</a>. He notes that today, it's easier than ever to learn music production through platforms like YouTube tutorials, with minimal equipment required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:01">[02:12:01]</a>.

### The Transition from Engineer to Artist
After college, Badshah worked as a subdivisional officer for the Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB) in Himachal Pradesh, operating water canal gates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:53">[02:08:53]</a>. His "big break" came when he connected with Honey Singh, initially writing for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:14">[02:08:14]</a>. He later produced his own song, "Saturday Saturday," which gained local popularity in 2012 and was eventually picked up by Dharma Productions for a movie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:06">[02:10:06]</a>.

### [[importance_of_passion_and_persistence_in_creative_industries | Importance of Passion and Persistence in Creative Industries]]
Badshah believes that for aspiring musicians, the primary prerequisite is "the want" or love for music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:14">[02:13:14]</a>. He strongly advises against entering the industry solely for money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:03">[02:13:03]</a>. He echoes Jay-Z's sentiment that "the only genius thing that I did was not giving up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:50">[02:13:50]</a>. This persistence, combined with conviction and self-belief, is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:21">[02:14:21]</a>.

Unlike athletes, musicians and actors don't have a fixed age limit, as "there is no age" to act or be a musician <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:02">[02:22:02]</a>. The key is to "stay relevant" by constantly evolving and adapting to changing times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:30">[02:22:30]</a>.

### Advice for Aspiring Musicians
*   **Be Original**: While it's natural to be inspired, aim for originality as "everyone in this world is different" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:40">[02:35:40]</a>.
*   **Patience**: This is "the biggest virtue" for success, both in making it and staying relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:26">[02:36:26]</a>.
*   **Embrace Technology**: Badshah advises embracing AI in music, viewing it as inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:01">[02:05:01]</a>.
*   **Invest in Live Events**: For music entrepreneurs, Live Events are a rapidly growing sector with significant investment potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:38">[02:06:38]</a>.

## General Principles for Nontraditional Careers

### [[overcoming_challenges_in_offbeat_careers | Overcoming challenges in offbeat careers]]
All three guests faced unique [[personal_challenges_and_resilience_in_career | personal challenges and resilience in career]] as they navigated their paths in unconventional fields. Kriti overcame stage fright and early performance anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>. Rahul dealt with intense public scrutiny and trolling, adapting by limiting social media engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:46">[01:32:46]</a>. Badshah channeled his inability to express verbally into writing music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:36">[02:01:36]</a>.

### [[balancing_passion_and_profitability_in_careers | Balancing Passion and Profitability in Careers]]
The discussion touches on the balance between passion and financial success. Kriti, coming from a middle-class background, never felt the need to work solely for money and now prioritizes roles that excite her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. Rahul, facing a finite athletic career, actively plans for financial independence post-cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:27">[02:18:27]</a>. Badshah explicitly advises against entering the music industry just for wealth, recommending stock investments instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:03">[02:13:03]</a>.

### [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_advice_for_young_aspiring_entrepreneurs | Entrepreneurial Journey and Advice for Young Aspiring Entrepreneurs]]
When considering entrepreneurship, it's advised to choose sectors that are not "cool" or "sexy" and lack "passionate people," as these areas tend to be less competitive and more profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:40">[01:49:40]</a>. Identifying sectors likely to grow significantly (e.g., energy transition, health & wellness) is crucial, as are choosing areas with governmental support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:56">[01:51:56]</a>. The importance of quick decision-making and willingness to abandon non-performing projects to preserve time, "the only finite element," is also highlighted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:50">[02:39:50]</a>.

### The Role of Coolness and Enigma
The guests discuss the importance of "coolness" and "enigma" in their public personas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:06">[02:24:06]</a>. Shah Rukh Khan is cited as an example of coolness due to his blend of confidence, intelligence, wit, and self-deprecating humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:40">[02:24:40]</a>. Authenticity and conviction are seen as key elements of coolness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:29">[02:26:29]</a>.

### [[balancing_personal_life_and_profession_in_highpressure_careers | Balancing Personal Life and Profession in HighPressure Careers]]
Rahul emphasizes the importance of a stable personal relationship as a "safe space" that provides grounding and focus in a high-pressure career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:48">[02:31:48]</a>. Kriti, while close to her family, acknowledges her professional focus can sometimes lead to less frequent communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:14">[02:28:14]</a>.

### [[role_of_cultural_and_family_background_in_career_choices | Role of Cultural and Family Background in Career Choices]]
All three grew up in traditional Indian households with academically focused parents. While their parents were supportive of their unconventional pursuits, they often imposed conditions related to academic performance. Kriti's mother's unfulfilled dreams influenced her push for Kriti's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. Rahul's father, who had to give up cricket, was supportive of his son's dream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:37">[01:14:37]</a>.

### [[personal_anecdotes_about_career_offers and choices | Personal anecdotes about career offers and choices]]
Kriti's entry into acting happened by chance, starting with modeling suggestions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:30">[00:52:30]</a>. Badshah transitioned from a government job to music after connecting with Honey Singh and seeing the potential in his unique sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:29">[02:08:29]</a>. Rahul's early obsession with cricket led him to pursue professional coaching despite his father's initial reluctance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>.

### Final Advice: Patience and Originality
The overarching advice for young people pursuing unconventional careers is to cultivate **patience** and remain **original** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:26">[02:36:26]</a>. Being inspired is good, but being influenced by others can stifle one's unique identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:51">[02:35:51]</a>. Success, it seems, is a matter of conviction and sustained effort, coupled with the ability to adapt and learn constantly.

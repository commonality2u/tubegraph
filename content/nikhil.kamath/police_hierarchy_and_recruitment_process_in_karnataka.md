## Overview of the Police Department

The basic fundamental unit of policing is the police station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[10:07]</a>. The majority of the police force, about 83%, consists of the constabulary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. Officers comprise the senior levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[10:05]</a>.

## Police Hierarchy

The hierarchy within the police force, from the highest to the lowest rank, is as follows:
*   **Director General and Inspector General of Police (DGP & IGP)**: The highest rank in Karnataka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
*   **Additional Director General of Police (Additional DGP)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>

*   **Superintendent of Police (SP)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. In a city's commissionerate, the equivalent post is Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
*   **Deputy Superintendent of Police (DYP)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>

*   **Sub-Inspector** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>
*   **Constabulary** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>

## Recruitment Process

There are four main levels to join the police force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>:

### 1. Indian Police Service (IPS) Level
This is the highest entry level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. Candidates join as an Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. After four years of service, they are promoted to the SP rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The IPS exam is a national exam, and successful candidates are allocated to a state cadre based on their rank and choice of zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. Karnataka's IPS cadre strength is about 220 officers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

### 2. Karnataka Public Service Commission (KPSC) Level
Candidates can join at the DYP (Deputy Superintendent of Police) level through the Karnataka Public Service Commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. This is also referred to as the Karnataka Police Service (KSPS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. A percentage of IPS posts are reserved for officers who join at the DSP level through the KPSC examination, allowing them to eventually get promoted to the IPS cadre after a minimum qualifying service and as vacancies arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

### 3. Sub-Inspector Level
Entry at the Sub-Inspector level is possible through an examination conducted by the recruitment wing of the police department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

### 4. Constabulary Level
The lowest entry level is the constabulary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. The exam for this level is conducted at the district or unit level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. Constables constitute about 83% of the police force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

### UPSC Examination Challenges
The UPSC examination, particularly for IPS, is highly competitive. Approximately 10 lakh people apply, with about 5-6 lakh taking the exam. Out of these, 10,000-14,000 qualify for the main examination, which filters down to 3,000 for interviews, and only about 850-1,000 candidates are finally selected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:15">[00:40:15]</a>. It requires significant hard work and perseverance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:58">[00:33:58]</a>.

## Career Progression and Opportunities

Police officers can also go on deputation to central organizations such as the CBI, CISF, and BSF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>. This requires concurrence from the concerned state and approval from the central government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>. Historically, fewer people from Karnataka opted for central deputations due to factors like the state's comfortable living conditions, good cadre management, and less political witch-hunting compared to other states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>. However, in the last 10-15 years, the number of people from Karnataka taking the UPSC examination and gaining central representation has increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:04">[00:53:04]</a>.

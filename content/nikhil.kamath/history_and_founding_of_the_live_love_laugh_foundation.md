The Live Love Laugh Foundation (TLLLF), led by Anisha Padukone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, is an organization dedicated to mental health. The foundation's journey began with its founder's personal experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

## Origin Story

The Live Love Laugh Foundation was established by Deepika Padukone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a> following her personal battle with anxiety and depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Her experiences highlighted a severe lack of awareness regarding mental health in India and the significant stigma associated with mental illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Padukone sought to address these issues in a systematic and sustainable manner, leading to the establishment of TLLLF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

The core belief driving the organization from its inception is that "no life should be lost due to mental illness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, especially given India's high rates of suicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. The foundation's vision is to provide hope to individuals experiencing stress, anxiety, and depression, particularly in times when they feel there is none <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

## Key Milestones

The history of The Live Love Laugh Foundation is marked by several significant moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>:

*   **December 2014**: On New Year's Eve, Deepika Padukone initiated her public commitment to mental health by sharing her first tweets on the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   **National Television Interview**: Padukone gave her first public interview on national television, openly sharing her personal story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This moment is recognized as a "watershed moment for mental health in the country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **October 2015**: The formal launch of The Live Love Laugh Foundation took place in Mumbai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   **First School Program**: TLLLF conducted its first school program session at St. Teresa School, Safire High School in Bangalore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This program aimed to create mental health awareness among adolescent students and their teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **First Rural Visit**: In October 2017, the founder and trustees made their first rural visit to Davangere to commemorate World Mental Health Day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## Operational Philosophy: The Three A's

The Live Love Laugh Foundation focuses its efforts on three key areas, known as "The Three A's" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>:
*   **Awareness** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>
*   **Accessibility** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>
*   **Affordability** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>

All of TLLLF's programs and initiatives align with these three pillars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. The foundation tailors its programs and initiatives based on the target audience and utilizes appropriate mediums to reach them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. For example, digital mediums are used for urban dwellers who consume social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>, while different approaches are necessary for rural populations where social media may not be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

## Challenges in Rural India

Reaching rural areas presents unique challenges for mental health awareness. Unlike urban centers where discussions about mental health are more prevalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>, rural India often struggles with understanding mental illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. There is a strong belief in faith healers and black magic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>, and instances of severe mental illness may manifest as aggressive behavior, sometimes leading to individuals being physically restrained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

To address these complexities, TLLLF employs a community-based model for its rural programs, focusing on supporting, raising awareness within, and empowering the broader community rather than solely individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

## Achievements and Impact

When asked about the foundation's achievements over its 8-year journey, Anisha Padukone highlighted the individual transformations witnessed through their work, whether in rural or urban settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. The greatest achievement is when individuals approach team members, sharing how TLLLF helped them through extremely difficult situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. These personal stories of transformation are classified as the true [[success_stories_and_impact_of_the_live_love_laugh_foundation | success stories and impact]] of the foundation, more so than awards or other forms of recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

The foundation recently secured funding of 75 lakh rupees, which will be primarily used to scale their rural mental health program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. This program has been running since 2016, and its established model allows for significant expansion this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

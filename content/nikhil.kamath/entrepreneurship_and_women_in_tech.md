## Empowering a Community
A significant [[entrepreneurship_and_startup_success|entrepreneurship]] community consists of approximately 25,000 [[empowering_women_through_entrepreneurship|women]] who are actively involved in selling software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This active participation highlights [[empowering_women_through_entrepreneurship|women's engagement in tech and business]].

## Practical Experience in Tech Sales
Selling software, particularly in a demanding environment, is considered an excellent "crash course in sales" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This experience is gained by [[empowering_women_through_entrepreneurship|women]] within the entrepreneurial community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. An individual's experience of taking three days to build their first "chat seriously project" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a> further demonstrates practical technical involvement.

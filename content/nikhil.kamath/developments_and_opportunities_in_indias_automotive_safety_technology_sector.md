India's automotive safety technology sector is witnessing significant developments, particularly in the two-wheeler segment, driven by a pressing need for enhanced safety features and the adoption of advanced technologies like AI.

## The Need for Two-Wheeler Safety
Two-wheelers account for over 60% of the 50 million global accidents annually, resulting in more than 15 million riders being injured or dying each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. This alarming statistic highlights the urgent need for robust safety systems in this segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>.

## Bites: AI-Powered ADAS for Two-Wheelers
Bites is an Indian startup focused on building India's first AI-powered Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) specifically for two-wheeler vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. The company aims to democratize access to ADAS systems, making them available to a wider range of riders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>.

### Genesis and Motivation
The co-founder's personal experience of frequently facing unsafe situations during long rides underscored the widespread problem of two-wheeler safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. This led to extensive market research, including conversations with riding communities and potential customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. A survey revealed that 50-60% of over 1,000 people were interested in purchasing ADAS features for their two-wheelers at a decent cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

### Strategic Focus and Market Entry
While autonomous vehicles for four-wheelers in India are a long-term prospect due to high deployment and data collection costs (around ₹1 Crore per vehicle) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>, Bites has opted to focus on two-wheelers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>. Data collection for two-wheelers is significantly cheaper, costing about ₹5 Lakhs per vehicle including vehicle cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. This allows for flexible and large-scale data recording on multiple vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.

Bites is pursuing a Tier-1 OEM partnership strategy, currently piloting with five out of twelve OEMs approached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>. OEMs are seeking such solutions to differentiate their brands and add safety features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>.

### Business Model and Funding
Bites plans to offer its ADAS as a service with a subscription model for fleet management companies (costing approximately ₹150-₹300 per month) and a direct purchase model for larger OEMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.

The company is currently raising a pre-seed round of $500K USD, with $250K already committed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. Their vision is to have their technology present in half a million vehicles within the next three years, with strong interest also coming from other Asian countries like Indonesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.

### Why OEMs Don't Build It Themselves
OEMs often partner with technology providers like Bites to accelerate market deployment, similar to how Mahindra vehicles use Mobileye for ADAS features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. The two-wheeler market is rapidly evolving, with new features being introduced quickly (e.g., Ola launching ADAS plans on August 15th, and Ather launching skid control the next month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>. This rapid replication necessitates technology partners to ensure faster go-to-market strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.

The broader context of [[opportunities_in_indias_entrepreneurial_landscape | entrepreneurship opportunities in India]] and [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_the_electric_vehicle_industry | challenges and opportunities in the electric vehicle industry]] provides a fertile ground for startups like Bites. The push for safety features and innovation in mobility reflects a growing maturity in the Indian market, where consumers and manufacturers are increasingly recognizing the value of advanced automotive technologies.

The WTF Fund, a non-dilutive grant for founders aged 25 and under, supports various innovative projects, including those focused on healthier food solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>.

## Healthier Snack Alternatives

One startup supported by the WTF Fund is crafting chips from nuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. This idea emerged from a friend's desire to [[food_tasting | eat]] something "junk" but that also needed to be [[diet_and_nutrition | healthier]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

## Novel Protein Production

Another initiative is focused on creating protein or food at large in regions where it was previously not possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. The core of their technology involves converting unused carbon, in carbohydrate form, into protein more efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. This company is starting with [[advancements_in_pet_care_and_nutrition | pet nutrition]] as its initial focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

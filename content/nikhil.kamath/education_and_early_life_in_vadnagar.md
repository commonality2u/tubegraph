The early life and education of [[the_life_and_background_of_prime_minister_narendra_modi | Prime Minister Narendra Modi]] were centered in Vadnagar, a small town in North Gujarat's Maisana district. He describes his upbringing and the unique characteristics of his hometown, which significantly shaped his formative years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Childhood in Vadnagar
Born in Gujarat, Narendra Modi's childhood was spent in Vadnagar, which had a population of about 15,000 people when he was a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. His village was part of the Gaekwad State, known for its emphasis on education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. This focus manifested in common village amenities such as a pond, a post office, and a library <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

### Educational Experiences
He attended a primary school built by the Gaekwad State <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. For his high school education, he went to BN High School (Bhagavatacharya Narayanacharya High School), which was described as a charitable institution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. At that time, schooling involved an 11th grade, rather than the modern 10+2 system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

Reflecting on his time as a student, he characterized himself as "a very average student" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15]">[00:19:15]</a>. He admits to having little interest in exams, often just aiming to pass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. However, he excelled in other activities and had a natural ability to grasp new things instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

He highlights the significant influence of his teachers, particularly Belji Bhai, who saw talent in him despite his lack of attention to studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. He recalls his teachers expressing great affection for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. As Chief Minister, he publicly honored all his childhood teachers, including the oldest one who was 93 years old, as a way to acknowledge their contribution to his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.

### Childhood Activities and Aspirations
A key part of his early life involved swimming in the village pond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. He would even wash his family's clothes to gain permission to go there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. He was also inspired by his PT teacher, Mr. Parmar, to learn wrestling and the "stool pillar" (a wooden exercise pillar, common in Maharashtra) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. He would wake up at 5:00 AM to train <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

He recounts an early ambition to join a Sainik school, a dream that was not realized due to his family's financial constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:14">[01:03:14]</a>. This unfulfilled wish remained a "first setback" for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>. He also harbored a desire to live a saintly life and attempted to join the Ramakrishna Mission, but did not meet their qualifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:48">[01:03:48]</a>. These early aspirations, though unfulfilled, highlight the diverse interests and paths considered during his youth.

### Influence of Childhood Experiences
His early life experiences, particularly the challenges he witnessed, profoundly impacted his later approach to politics and governance. He recalls seeing mothers and sisters in his home state walk three kilometers with two pots on their heads to fetch water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:12">[00:32:12]</a>. This experience fueled his determination to ensure water delivery for all citizens, even 75 years after independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>. He states that his activities and plans are "born out of those feelings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a>. He also asserts that his life journey was not self-created but shaped by circumstances, with problems acting as his "biggest university" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a>. This reflects the [[influence_of_upbringing_on_achievements | influence of upbringing on achievements]].

He maintains that he has always lived outside his comfort zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>, believing that addiction to comfort can hinder progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:18">[01:08:18]</a>. His approach to risk-taking is rooted in not caring for himself, allowing him to make bold decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:40">[01:09:40]</a>. This philosophy contributes to his "one life, one mission" mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:28">[01:10:28]</a>.

> "Life teaches a lot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>... The problem was my university <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:52">[00:31:52]</a>."

He learned Hindi while selling tea at the railway station, interacting with people from different provinces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:12">[01:52:12]</a>. These interactions, and hearing others sing bhajans and kirtans, helped him develop his language skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:35">[01:52:35]</a>.

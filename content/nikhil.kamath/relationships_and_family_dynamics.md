He also discusses the evolution of his views on [[attachment_styles_and_psychological_analysis | detachment]] and the profound impact of fatherhood.

## Childhood and Parental Relationships

Born in Shimoga, Karnataka, the interviewee's father worked in Canara Bank and was transferred every three years, leading to moves from Shimoga to Hassen, and then to Karnal for three years, where he still has friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. After the age of seven, he stayed in Bangalore with his mother, as his father's transfers continued beyond their travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. His mother's family, including his grandmother and her brother, were also in Bangalore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. He has lived in Bangalore for the past 30 years and feels immense love for the city, believing it has given him everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

The interviewee grew up in a privileged household, as the fourth generation of actors in his family, born to Rishi Kapoor and Neetu Singh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. He attended Bombay Scottish School but was not good at studies, realizing early on that acting did not require academic prowess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. He was an introvert and was never selected for dramatics in school, but football gave him purpose as he was good at it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. Despite being a "celebrity kid," he was not treated specially and was often disciplined by teachers and the principal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. He vividly recalls getting 54.3% in his 10th standard boards, a result that brought immense happiness to his family, who saw it as a genius achievement since many in his family had dropped out earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

### Father's Parenting Style and Relationship
The interviewee's father, Rishi Kapoor, was short-tempered but a very good man who loved his family, work, food, and alcohol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. He was an open person, speaking his mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. The interviewee was scared of his father, never saying no and always feeling on edge due to his volatile temperament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. He grew up hearing his parents fight frequently, spending much of his childhood on the staircase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. He believes his father's generation of men were scared of vulnerability and struggled to express love physically, like holding hands or hugging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

His father kept him on a very tight budget during his studies in New York, allowing only a $2 McDonald's dollar menu meal for lunch and dinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. Upon returning to Mumbai, his father took away his car and did not give him pocket money while he assisted on the film "Black" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. This was done to school him and expose him to hardship, as his father believed he was "too moisturized" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

Despite the distance, he loved and respected his father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:33">[00:33:33]</a>. He notes that while he was scared of his father's temperament, his parents eventually found beautiful companionship, especially during his father's battle with cancer, witnessing his mother's selfless service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. The interviewee believes that movies of that era might have subconsciously influenced men of that generation to be a certain way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.

## Sibling Relationship
The interviewee has an elder sister, two years his senior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. They shared a room until he was 13 and she was 15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>. She used to beat him up when she was bigger, but he would beat her when he grew in size, doing "WWF stunts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. They missed out on good bonding years because she left for London for further education, and by the time she returned, he went to New York; when he came back, she got married <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. His sister is happily married in Delhi and has a 13-year-old daughter named Samara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. He loves his brother-in-law, Bharat, and is happy for his sister, but admits he is not as close to her as he would like to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>.

## Personal Relationships and [[Attachment styles and psychological analysis | Detachment]]
The interviewee identifies as having an [[attachment_styles_and_psychological_analysis | avoidant attachment style]] since a very young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. He recalls a memory from when he was four or five years old, feeling intense pain and something breaking inside when a friend would leave after playing, leading him to close up and detach himself from everybody <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>. He has also "stopped crying very early on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:37">[00:33:37]</a>. He describes how he didn't cry when his father passed away, experiencing a panic attack instead, and feels he hasn't grieved or fully understood the loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:46">[00:33:46]</a>. He feels guilt for not having the "grace to let go of the distance" and hug his father during his final year of cancer treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:48">[00:34:48]</a>.

He did not date anyone during his 3 years and 9 months in New York, believing that his first girlfriend from school was the "love of his life" and he needed to focus on work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>. Upon returning, he dated two successful actresses, which led to him being labeled a "Casanova" and a "cheater" by the media for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:52">[00:53:52]</a>. While this used to bother him and his parents, he now views himself as a commodity and doesn't take it seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:11">[00:54:11]</a>.

### Marriage and Fatherhood
He believes in one woman forever in a romantic relationship, stating it's the "only healthy way of living" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:18">[00:55:18]</a>. He does not want to hurt his wife, Alia, or his daughter, and will "definitely not do anything which will ever make them question" him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:38">[00:55:38]</a>. He considers his wife his best friend, valuing their ability to chat and laugh together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>. Alia is 11 years younger than him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:27">[00:56:27]</a>. He first met her when she was 9 and he was 20 or 21, during a photo shoot for a film about child marriage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:32">[00:56:32]</a>. They started living together in 2018 when they began working on the film *Brahmastra*, and their romance started on the plane to Tel Aviv <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:12">[00:59:12]</a>. The lockdown period of COVID-19 further solidified their relationship, as they spent the entire time together, remaining healthy and engaging in activities like playing online Catan and learning poker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:48">[00:59:48]</a>.

He holds immense respect for Alia as an actor, artist, and person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:10">[00:57:10]</a>. She makes him happy, and he loves going on holiday with her and coming home to her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:23">[00:57:23]</a>. He acknowledges that Alia is an ambitious overachiever, extremely passionate and intelligent about her work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:32">[00:57:32]</a>. He appreciates that she has made significant efforts to change for him, more than he has for her, for example, by moderating her loud tone, which used to affect him due to his father's similar demeanor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:02">[00:58:02]</a>.

Fatherhood has been a game-changer, making him question his long-held [[attachment_styles_and_psychological_analysis | detachment and indifference]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>. He feels "reborn" since his daughter Raha's birth, experiencing new emotions and thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>. He used to say he would die at 71 due to an obsession with the number eight, but now feels that's too soon and wishes to live at least 40 more years for his daughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. He describes the moment Raha was born and given to him as if "somebody's kind of taking a your heart out and just put it in your hand," an instant and indescribable love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:03">[01:17:03]</a>. His daughter views Alia as part of herself, but with him, she seeks "musty and fun and the laughter and and and flirting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:36">[01:17:36]</a>. He believes a partner's relationship with one's family is a game-changer in marriage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:34">[01:00:34]</a>. His mother and Alia have a very good and honest relationship, which makes him happy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a>. He feels blessed to be surrounded by strong women: his mother, sister, niece, wife, and daughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:22">[01:01:22]</a>.

## Self-Perception and External Validation
The interviewee recognizes that as an actor, his life is now a commodity, and he is accepted by the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:52">[00:54:52]</a>. He no longer takes himself too seriously, acknowledging that millions of problems are more important than him feeling bad about what is written about him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:07">[00:55:07]</a>. He has never had a problem with being unnoticed, being happy if he is not the most important person in the room or if other actors get more attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:54">[01:05:54]</a>. His confidence has improved over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:27">[01:06:27]</a>.

## Impact of Social Media
He consciously avoids being too active on social media, believing that constant presence would make people bored of him and diminish the "mystery" of a film actor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. He feels that today's audience falls in love with flaws and vulnerabilities, rather than a perfect media-trained image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:45">[00:31:45]</a>. He believes that if an authentic version of himself, with flaws and strengths, were depicted, it would resonate more with people, likening it to how people buy George Clooney's tequila because they're buying into *him* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>. He also states that [[impact_of_social_media_on_personal_relationships | social media played havoc]] with the perception of his film *Animal*, misconstruing its intention and diminishing the hard work behind it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.

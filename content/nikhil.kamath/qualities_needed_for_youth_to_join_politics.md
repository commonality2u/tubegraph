For young individuals contemplating a career in politics, certain attributes are deemed essential for their success and for the betterment of the political landscape. The speaker notes that if a youth wishes to become a politician, they must possess demonstrable talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Desired Characteristics

### Integrity and Mission-Driven Approach
It is crucial that "good people" continue to enter politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. These individuals should be driven by a mission rather than personal ambition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. The speaker acknowledges their own fallibility, stating that they too must make mistakes as a human being, not a god <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Overcoming Perceptions
A significant challenge for potential youth entrants is the deeply ingrained [[perceptions_of_politics_as_a_career_path | perception that politics is a dirty place]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This belief has become so embedded in the collective psyche that it is very difficult to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This background suggests that youth entering politics must be prepared to confront and potentially alter such negative views.

Starting a business as a woman in India, particularly in the nascent biotech sector of the late 1970s, presented a unique set of [[Challenges faced by women entrepreneurs | challenges]]. Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, founder of Biocon, recounts the significant hurdles she encountered in her entrepreneurial journey. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>

## Initial Disadvantages and Perceptions
When Kiran Mazumdar Shaw decided to start Biocon, it required "foolish courage" due to the tough path ahead. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a> At 25 years old, she was a young woman with no prior business experience and limited personal funds, possessing only 10,000 rupees in her bank account. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a> She was attempting to establish a "strange business" called biotech, which was poorly understood at the time. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:46">[00:30:46]</a> In the eyes of many, she was considered a "high risk." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>

She initially expressed her concerns to an Irish biotech entrepreneur, stating that India was not welcoming to women in business and that she had no money or business experience, all compounded by the fact that she was a woman. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a> In 1978, prominent women in business were rare, with only a few exceptions like Rati Muraji. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>

## Financial Obstacles
Accessing funding was a major hurdle. Bankers were reluctant to offer credit lines, often demanding her father's guarantee despite his lack of involvement in her business. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:56">[00:30:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a> She challenged this, questioning why a guarantee from a male entrepreneur was accepted but not from her, highlighting the significant gender bias of the era. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a> Despite having a substantial draft of 10,000 pounds from her Irish partner as an advance payment and buyback guarantee, banks struggled to comprehend her biotech venture and extend a credit line. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a> It was only one "brave banker" from Canara Bank, Dinesh Nayak, who took a chance on her. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:05">[00:34:05]</a>

## Hiring Difficulties
Beyond finance, hiring proved challenging as "people didn't want to work for a woman." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a> Her first two employees were retired tractor mechanics who were desperate for work, making them indifferent to her gender. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a> However, within a few years, her public recognition, including being featured on the cover of Business World and India Today as one of the first women entrepreneurs, helped attract bright minds. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>

## Societal and Cultural Barriers
The low participation of [[Women in the Indian workforce | women in the Indian workforce]] is primarily attributed to societal culture and perceptions of women's roles. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:14">[01:32:14]</a> This issue is exacerbated by the venture funding industry, where most funds are directed towards male-led businesses because "the money is in the hands of men," who feel more comfortable investing in ventures run by other men. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:51">[01:32:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:13">[01:33:13]</a> Women still face significant [[Challenges faced by women entrepreneurs | challenges in raising equity and venture capital]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:17">[01:33:17]</a> Investors have been observed making judgments based on the entrepreneur's style rather than the business fundamentals. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:42">[01:33:42]</a> This predisposition and gender bias in venture capital remain a significant challenge for women even today. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:53">[01:33:53]</a>

### Board Representation
While ESG initiatives are increasing focus on gender balance, many companies still only appoint one woman to their board, often due to statutory requirements. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:16">[01:34:16]</a> Kiran questions why companies don't aim for 30-40% female representation on boards. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:38">[01:34:38]</a> She believes this is partly because not enough women are "noticed," leading to the same few women being appointed repeatedly. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:50">[01:34:50]</a>

### Workforce Gender Balance
Within her own company, Biocon, Kiran acknowledges the low percentage of women on the shop floor (around 10%), a ratio she is actively trying to increase to at least 30%. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:21">[01:35:21]</a> She has implemented performance goals for leadership teams to prioritize increasing female representation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:45">[01:35:45]</a> While R&D and HR roles see good female participation (over 40% in research), sales and marketing in pharmaceuticals are still heavily male-dominated (90% men in India, compared to 40% in the US). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:16">[01:36:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:35">[01:36:35]</a> Manufacturing remains a difficult area for female employment. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:11">[01:37:11]</a> Historically, pharmaceutical companies allowed women only one general shift, but recent government changes now permit women to work in other shifts, which is expected to change dynamics. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:41">[01:37:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:56">[01:37:56]</a>

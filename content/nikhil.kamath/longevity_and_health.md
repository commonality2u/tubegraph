## Measuring Health and Data Ownership

One perspective on health measurement suggests that an individual can be "the most measured person in human history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. A comprehensive approach to medicine advocates for a "systemic whole body approach" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

The control of health-related data is largely shifting towards technology companies, with "Apple and Samsung" identified as potential "biggest owners of data" due to their wearable technology like smartwatches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. For nations like India to advance in healthcare AI, developing their "own data sets" is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Additionally, the importance of mental health support is noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## The "Don't Die" Framework

The concept of "Don't Die" is presented as a multifaceted framework:
*   A philosophical framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>
*   An economic plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>
*   Political <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>
*   Moral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>
*   Social <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>

Core principles of this framework include: "don't kill each other," "don't kill the planet," and aligning AI with the "don't die" principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. An ethical challenge posed to this framework is a hypothetical scenario where survival necessitates extreme actions, such as "eat Bran's heart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The "second rule" emphasizes not killing each other and not destroying the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

Discussions touched upon various [[supplements_and_treatments_for_longevity | longevity supplements]] that individuals may be taking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. A growth hormone was also mentioned as a potential treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. When considering treatments, the advice is to seek specific interventions if "some specific issues" are present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

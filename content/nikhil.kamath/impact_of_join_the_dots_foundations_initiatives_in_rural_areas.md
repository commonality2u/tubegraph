[[join_the_dots_foundation_overview_and_mission | Join The Dots Foundation]] is an organization dedicated to transforming lives in rural areas of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The foundation gained significant funding, including 1 Crore rupees, from "The Venture Capitalist" episode of a podcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Founding and Mission
The foundation was established in 2014 by Danay Ramakrishna, who left his job at Microsoft to dedicate himself to this cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. His motivation stemmed from recognizing the untapped opportunity to support students in rural areas after observing 17 schools in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

The mission statement of [[join_the_dots_foundation_overview_and_mission | Join The Dots Foundation]] is: "Every student must become the best version of themselves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
Their vision is to help 10,000 students by the end of 2031 to achieve an annual income of 50 LPA (Lakhs Per Annum), contribute 2% back to the foundation and community, and dedicate 10 hours of their time to service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Key Initiatives and Impact

### Infrastructure Development
[[join_the_dots_foundation_overview_and_mission | Join The Dots Foundation]], with support from Nikhil Kamath and WTF, has brought metropolitan-style infrastructure to rural schools. An example includes the inauguration of a children's park in Jari Pali, near Palum, providing recreational facilities previously uncommon in such areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

### [[Sports and cultural development efforts in Join The Dots Foundation | Sports Development]]
The foundation also invests in and supports [[sports and cultural development efforts in Join The Dots Foundation | sports programs]] in rural schools. Shila, the Sports Coordinator, oversees initiatives like fencing, introducing unique athletic opportunities to students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

### [[Educational programs and funding at Join The Dots Foundation | Educational Programs]] and Skill Development
[[join_the_dots_foundation_overview_and_mission | Join The Dots Foundation]] focuses on skill development to empower students. One notable program selects resilient girls from 34 schools through rigorous testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. These girls learn data structures, algorithms, HTML, and CSS for a year to become software developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. After finishing 12th grade, they will live in a two-bedroom apartment with an office-like setup for three years, attending college and learning full-stack web development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. The goal is to transform their lives by enabling them to become self-sufficient software developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

### [[Special needs support initiatives at Join The Dots Foundation | Special Needs Support]]

The Live Love Laugh (LLL) Foundation, led by Anisha Padukone, was founded as a direct response to the founder's personal experience with anxiety and depression, highlighting two significant issues in India: a severe lack of [[mental_health_and_its_importance | mental health]] awareness and substantial stigma associated with mental illness, particularly in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:03">[03:03:03]</a>. The organization's core belief is that "no life should be lost due to mental illness," given India's high suicide rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:36">[03:34:36]</a>. LLL's vision is to provide hope to individuals experiencing stress, anxiety, and depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:48">[03:48:48]</a>.

## Tailoring Outreach Strategies
LLL focuses on three key areas, known as the "Three A's": awareness, accessibility, and affordability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. All programs and initiatives fall under these categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. The approach to addressing [[mental_health_and_its_importance | mental health]] varies significantly depending on the target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:05">[05:05:05]</a>.

For an urban dweller who consumes social media, digital mediums are the most effective way to communicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>. However, for a 45-year-old man in rural India, social media is not a viable route <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>. Understanding the target audience and available resources is crucial for tailoring interventions accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.

## Specific Challenges in Rural India
Addressing [[mental_health_and_its_importance | mental health]] in rural areas presents distinct [[challenges_in_rural_mobile_usage | challenges]] compared to urban settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.

### Lack of Understanding and Stigma
In rural India, [[mental_health_and_its_importance | mental illness]] is often not understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>. There is a strong belief in faith healers and black magic, which complicates the acceptance of professional mental health care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>. The host noted that even in a Tier 1 city like Pune, discussing [[mental_health_and_its_importance | mental health]] and concepts like PTSD can be very difficult with parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. This difficulty is compounded in diverse rural communities.

### Severe Manifestations
Instances of [[mental_health_and_its_importance | mental illness]] in rural areas can manifest in severe ways, such as aggressive behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>. Unfortunately, some individuals exhibiting such behavior are subjected to extreme measures, like being chained to their bed or a tree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>.

## LLL's Community-Based Approach
To tackle these specific [[challenges_in_rural_mobile_usage | challenges]], LLL adopts a community-based model for its rural program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>. Rather than focusing on individuals alone, the program aims to support, raise awareness, and empower the broader community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>. The first rural visit for the foundation, commemorating World Mental Health Day, took place in Davangere in October 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.

## Measuring Impact
Unlike visible achievements like building schools or sending children to college, measuring the impact of mental health initiatives can be less tangible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>. For LLL, the biggest achievement is witnessing the personal transformation in individuals' lives due to their work, whether in rural or urban settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>. The team is often approached by unknown individuals who share how LLL helped them through extremely difficult situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>. Such transformational stories from beneficiaries, particularly in rural programs, are classified as success stories, rather than awards or other recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>.

## Scaling Rural Programs
The LLL Foundation was awarded between 75 lakh rupees and a crore rupees in a competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. In 2023, the organization decided to [[use_of_funds_for_scaling_rural_mental_health_programs | scale their rural mental health program]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>. This program has been running since 2016, and its established model allows for significant expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59:00">[08:59:00]</a>. The newly acquired funds will primarily be used for this scaling initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>.

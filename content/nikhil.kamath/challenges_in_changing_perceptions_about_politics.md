Perceptions about politics can be deeply ingrained from a young age, making them significantly challenging to alter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Ingrained Negative Perceptions

For many, especially those who grew up in backgrounds like a South Indian middle-class family, the idea that "politics is a dirty place" is communicated from childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. This particular perspective becomes so "ingrained in our psyche" that changing it poses a "very difficult" challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:59]</a>.

## The Role of Individuals in Politics

To improve the [[public_perception_and_selfawareness | public perception]] of politics, there is a sentiment that "good people should keep coming in politics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. These individuals are expected to enter with a "mission" rather than with "ambition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. It is also suggested that if a [[youth_involvement_in_politics | youth]] today aims to become a politician, they should possess certain talents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

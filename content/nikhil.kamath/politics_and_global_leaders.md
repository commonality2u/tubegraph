Modern political [[leadership_and_politics | leaders]] are engaging with the public through various digital platforms. For instance, a [[leadership_and_politics | politician]] who became the [[leadership_and_politics | president of Brazil]] has been seen interacting online, "beamed... through an app" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

This digital engagement, including online videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, can sometimes lead to [[public_perception_of_politics | public confusion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This dynamic influences [[public_perception_of_politics | public perception]], even causing figures like "Zuck" to appear as a "nice guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

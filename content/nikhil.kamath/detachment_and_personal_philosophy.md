From: [[nikhil.kamath]] <br/> 

The concept of [[philosophical_framework_of_dont_die|Detachment]] is a core element of the speaker's personal philosophy, which he has consciously adopted and reflected upon throughout his life. This approach was initially influenced by childhood experiences and has since been significantly challenged and re-evaluated by his experience of fatherhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>.

## Origins of Detachment

The speaker identifies with a long-standing personal [[personal_relationships_and_identity|Detachment]] and an "avoidant attached" personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>. He recalls a vivid memory from when he was about four or five years old: a friend leaving his home caused intense internal pain and a feeling of something breaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>. This early experience led him to "close up" and detach from everyone, questioning if he was inherently born with this trait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.

## Evolution of Detachment and Impact of Fatherhood

> "I've always been that person... I've always been that person you think you're that avoidant attached I think so always and this is not something that I became after I became a working professional I was like this at a very young age" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>

Despite his long-held [[philosophical_framework_of_dont_die|Detachment]], becoming a father has fundamentally altered his perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>. He describes the birth of his daughter as a "game changer" that is making him question [[philosophical_framework_of_dont_die|Detachment and indifference]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>. He feels "reborn" and is experiencing a lot of new emotions and thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.

Previously, he "never feared death" and had an obsession with the number eight, leading him to believe he would die at 71 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. Now, with a daughter, he feels 71 is "too soon" and hopes to live at least 40 more years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>. This shift indicates a deeper engagement with life and future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>.

### The Illusion of Detachment

The speaker reflects on the perception of his own [[philosophical_framework_of_dont_die|Detachment]], acknowledging that he is "still attached interesting while pretending to be detached" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>. He recognizes that he often convinces himself of being detached, even when it might not be entirely true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>.

## Views on Marriage and Relationships

He expresses a belief in "one woman forever" as the "only healthy way of living," expecting the same fidelity he would offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:18">[00:55:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:26">[00:55:26]</a>. He emphasizes his commitment to not hurting his wife, Alia, or his daughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:38">[00:55:38]</a>. He describes his romantic ideal as simply "hanging out" with his partner, highlighting the importance of friendship in his marriage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:02">[00:56:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:08">[00:56:08]</a>. His wife is his "best friend" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:13">[00:56:13]</a>.

He notes that in a marriage, individuals must "let go of your personality" and adjust to each other, which involves sacrifice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:38">[01:25:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:47">[01:25:47]</a>.

## Professional Life and Validation

The speaker finds a lot of [[public_perception_and_personal_image|validation]] from his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:03">[02:03:03]</a>. He attributes this validation to his "own subconscious validating my conscious side" rather than solely external approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:33">[02:05:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:42">[02:05:42]</a>. He admits to caring about what friends, peers, and colleagues think of him, but this is not his primary inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:47">[02:05:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:51">[02:05:51]</a>.

He acknowledges that [[professional_challenges_and_setbacks|success in the film industry]] is transient, and it is crucial not to get "too attached to it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:11">[01:15:11]</a>. He attributes this understanding to growing up in a film family and observing both successes and failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:16">[01:15:16]</a>. He maintains a balanced perspective, seeing a successful film as temporary until the next one, and a failure as an opportunity to "try harder again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>.

### Approach to Public Image

The speaker generally prefers to maintain a "mysterious aura" as a film actor, believing that excessive exposure on social media would lead to audiences getting "bored" of him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56">[00:31:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. He does not want to be the center of attention and is happy if others receive more attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:54">[01:05:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>.

## Spirituality and Beliefs

The speaker has a fluid relationship with God, oscillating between belief and uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:36">[00:42:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:38">[00:42:38]</a>. He admits to using belief in God as a "crutch" during drastically good or bad times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:53">[00:42:53]</a>. He states that his manifestation power is "very strong" and that he would get what he asked for easily, leading him to stop asking God for things at a young age to "save it for a rainy day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:17">[00:44:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:28">[00:44:28]</a>.

His relationship with God is primarily one of gratitude, feeling "very grateful for the place I'm in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>. He has started believing in the Sanatan Dharma and has read extensively about it in recent years, finding peace and a "good system" of values within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:10">[00:45:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:31">[00:45:31]</a>. He practices daily yoga and chanting, which makes him feel connected and brings good energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>.

## The Transience of Self

The speaker's t-shirt, bearing the word "transient," reflects his personal philosophy. He explains that this word holds significant meaning for him because he feels he has changed as a person every year over the last decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>. What he wanted one year has been "totally different" the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. Due to this constant personal evolution, he "would hate to commit the present version of myself to another person when I know I'm going to change so much" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:59">[00:21:59]</a>.

He lives by the philosophy of Jiddu Krishnamurti, summarized as "I don't mind what happens," embracing both pain and happiness without questioning them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:03">[01:25:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:10">[01:25:10]</a>.

## Insecurities and Growth

While he is not insecure about his work or art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:33">[01:36:33]</a>, the speaker acknowledges the role of [[psychological_analysis_and_therapy_experiences|insecurity]] in his personal journey, particularly in driving him to work harder to achieve what he desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:07">[01:36:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:11">[01:36:11]</a>. He believes that insecurity leading to action is conducive to growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:21">[01:36:21]</a>.

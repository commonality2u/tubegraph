## Kriti Sanon: From Shy Student to Confident Actor

Kriti Sanon describes herself as a "shy and a studious and a nerdy kid" during her formative years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. As a firstborn, she felt pressure to excel academically, with her mother being a professor and her father a Chartered Accountant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Despite her academic focus, Kriti also experienced significant stage fright <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

> [!info] Early Contradictions
> Kriti recalls being shy and needing time to open up to people, even taking her mother along to parties as a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. However, once she started dancing—a talent her mother recognized early on—she would feel "fine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Her mother enrolled her in Kathak classes at age five, recognizing her inherent ability and aiming to develop it into a skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. This classical training, though initially disliked, provided a foundational "rhythm and that grace" that later proved invaluable in her acting career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

Kriti's perfectionist tendencies and desire for validation from good grades and dance performances were evident from a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. Her mother's own unfulfilled aspirations, such as learning to sing or swim, fueled her competitive drive for Kriti's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

### Building Confidence in an Unconventional Career
Kriti's transition into acting was marked by initial struggles with [[selfconfidence_and_humility | self-confidence]]. She recounts crying after her first ramp show and first photoshoot due to self-consciousness and a feeling of not performing her best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>.

> [!quote] Gaining Confidence Through Exposure
> "I think I gained confidence with work while working. I think when you keep putting yourself in situations that you're scared of, at some point you surpass that and at some point you gain that confidence then you're like hey this is not that bad and hey I can do it so I feel like I have in a way taught my S confidence through" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:47">[00:41:47]</a>

Kriti deliberately sought out uncomfortable situations professionally, noting that the feelings of "scary and exciting" are often the same emotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:58">[00:42:58]</a>. Her persistence was key, as her first film audition for "Student of the Year One" was "horrible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:14">[00:55:14]</a>. Her mother, protective of her shy daughter, even suggested that the film industry was too tough and required a "thick skin" like Priyanka Chopra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:31">[00:55:31]</a>. Despite the setbacks and initial lack of confidence, Kriti continued, learning and improving with each audition and film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:26">[00:56:26]</a>. Her love for acting evolved *after* she started doing it, rather than being a pre-existing passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:10">[02:15:10]</a>.

A significant aspect of her growth was her willingness to ask questions. Initially, this was perceived negatively, particularly as a woman, but over time, it became recognized as a strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:35">[00:50:35]</a>. She emphasizes the importance of asking questions to learn and grow, accepting "not knowing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:08">[00:52:08]</a>.

## Rahul's Journey: Public Perception and Personal Growth

Rahul describes himself as a "shy, quiet guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:48">[01:26:48]</a> who became very confident after playing for India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:09">[01:28:09]</a>. However, a highly publicized interview and subsequent suspension "scarred" him massively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:40">[01:29:40]</a>. This experience, being exposed to significant public trolling, significantly impacted his [[public_perception_and_personal_growth | public perception and personal growth]], making him less outwardly confident than before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:42">[01:27:42]</a>.

To cope with trolling, Rahul decided to step back from Instagram for a year and a half, only using it to post and then quickly exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:46">[01:32:46]</a>. This [[resilience_in_the_face_of_personal_adversity | resilience in the face of personal adversity]] and detachment helped him manage external negativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:33">[01:31:33]</a>. He also finds solace and grounding by visiting temples, not to seek forgiveness or gratitude, but to remember humble beginnings and practice gratitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:20">[02:20:20]</a>. This reminds him not to overachieve or look too far ahead, preventing falls from striving for too much too quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:27">[02:23:27]</a>.

Rahul believes that inherent talent plays a significant role in success, especially in sports, differentiating between those who reach higher levels and those who don't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:15">[01:03:15]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of being "your own team" and fighting battles alone to go "a little bit longer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:55">[01:34:55]</a>.

## Badshah: Expressing Through Music and Adapting to Change

Badshah reveals that he started writing because he "couldn't express" himself, penning down his thoughts and feelings from a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:36">[02:01:36]</a>. His journey into music began with listening to songs and rhyming, eventually leading to a desire to perform and seek validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:51">[02:02:51]</a>.

For aspiring musicians, Badshah stresses the importance of originality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:27">[02:35:27]</a>. While inspiration from others is natural, he advises finding one's unique voice: "Be Inspired don't be influenced. Be Inspired which is fine you are as unique as your DNA. That is my story and that is cool, that is me and people will listen to it if you say it with conviction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:51">[02:35:51]</a>. He also highlights that success in music, like any creative field, is "all a matter of time" and requires immense patience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:55">[02:13:55]</a>.

> "JayZ once said that the only genius thing that I did was not giving up if you're truly passionate then I think it's only a matter of time and that's the biggest challenge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:37">[02:13:37]</a>

Badshah, as a musician, also emphasizes the need to "evolve and mold yourself" and "keep up with the changing time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:42">[02:22:42]</a>. The ability to adapt and be open to learning, even not knowing everything, is a crucial prerequisite for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:16">[02:23:16]</a>.

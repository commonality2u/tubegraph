The [[understanding_the_metaverse | Metaverse]] is poised to significantly transform social media and entertainment, driven by evolving [[role_of_technology_in_the_metaverse | technology]] and changing user behaviors. As experiences become more immersive and interactive, traditional media models are being challenged by the rise of new platforms and the [[the_impact_of_social_media_and_influencer_culture | creator economy]].

## Evolution of Media and Content Consumption

The way people consume information and entertainment has undergone a profound shift.
Historically, newspapers were the primary source of information, liberating society from earlier dictatorial eras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. However, newspaper readership and print circulation are now in decline globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. Smart companies are adapting by moving content behind paywalls with premium digital offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

Similarly, television is morphing into a digital device, with most TVs becoming Android, Apple, or smart TVs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. Broadcast content is expected to transition entirely to IP-based streaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. This shift empowers users to choose exactly what they watch, moving away from broadcast schedules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

The overall trend points towards hyper-personalization, where users can live within specific content "universes" like sports and remain unaware of other forms of entertainment, such as traditional movie stars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. The traditional craze for Friday movie releases has diminished as attention spans shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.

## The Rise of the [[the_impact_of_social_media_and_influencer_culture | Creator Economy]]

The barrier to becoming a "rock star" or prominent figure has continuously lowered over the past few decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. YouTube initially enabled this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. Today, short video apps like TikTok and Josh are described as "micro Bollywood movies," where creators can entertain audiences for 30 seconds, a role once dominated by actors in three-hour films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.

Platforms that enable individuals to become rock stars and gain wide distribution are thriving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. Content creators with built-in audiences are highly valued, as demonstrated by the success of creators like Tanmay Bhat, Bhuvan Bam, and Zakir Khan on OTT platforms and podcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>.

### Challenges for Influencers

The crypto "winter" exposed vulnerabilities for some [[the_impact_of_social_media_and_influencer_culture | influencers]], particularly those involved in sponsoring or shilling tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. Cases of "pump and dump" schemes were exposed, leading to public apologies from figures like Logan Paul, who was accused of scamming followers with an NFT project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. It is suggested that [[the_impact_of_social_media_and_influencer_culture | influencers]] would be better off supporting developer initiatives rather than shilling tokens, as this fosters appreciation within new communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

## [[defining_the_metaverse | Defining the Metaverse]] and Its [[impact_of_metaverse_on_daily_life_and_industry | Impact]]

The [[understanding_the_metaverse | Metaverse]] is generally understood as interconnected 3D spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>. While some define it as requiring [[virtual_reality_and_augmented_reality_in_the_metaverse | VR]] or [[virtual_reality_and_augmented_reality_in_the_metaverse | AR]] immersion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>, others argue that the "metaversal habit" already exists through 2D experiences on phones, where each app acts as a "universe" (e.g., Instagram for lifestyle, Twitter for opinions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>. The more immersive an experience gets, the more "meta" it becomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>.

The concept originated from the novel *Snow Crash* and was popularized by movies like *Ready Player One* and *The Matrix*, depicting immersive virtual worlds accessed via devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.

## [[technology_adoption_and_the_future_of_the_metaverse | Technology Adoption]] and [[impact_of_metaverse_on_daily_life_and_industry | Use Cases]]

The [[metaverse]] will become more accessible and widespread as [[role_of_technology_in_the_metaverse | technology]] advances, particularly with Moore's Law driving down compute costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a> and 5G enabling seamless streaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:36">[00:53:36]</a>. This will allow for the "democratization of [[role_of_technology_in_the_metaverse | technology]]," making immersive experiences available on any device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.

Key potential [[impact_of_metaverse_on_daily_life_and_industry | use cases]] for the [[metaverse]] include:
*   **Communication**: VR chat platforms like VR Chat, which allow users to interact in virtual rooms, are already popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>. Haptics will further enhance this, allowing for physical sensations like hugs across distances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:34]</a>.
*   **Gaming**: Gaming has long been a driver of [[metaverse]] development, with titles like Grand Theft Auto V's multiplayer role-playing mode offering deeply immersive virtual lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:20">[00:31:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:15">[00:41:15]</a>.
*   **Entertainment**: Watching mass events like the IPL or FIFA World Cup in an immersive virtual stadium from home is a potential killer app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>.
*   **Virtual Tourism and Shopping**: These [[impact_of_metaverse_on_daily_life_and_industry | use cases]] may require full immersion to replicate social feedback and decision-making processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a>.
*   **Fashion**: Companies like "another one" are creating web3 fashion platforms, offering access to digital products and enabling monetization and immersive experiences for brands and creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>. They replicate real-life fashion shows in [[metaverse]] buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:03">[00:41:03]</a>.
*   **Education, Learning, and Medicine**: These are considered "no-brainer" [[impact_of_metaverse_on_daily_life_and_industry | use cases]] for the [[metaverse]] due to its ability to create immersive environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:57">[01:07:57]</a>.

### Social Media's Adaptation

Social media platforms will need to unlearn their current models of central control over consumer data and monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:07]</a>. The [[metaverse]] ethos leans towards decentralization and user ownership, where creators receive a larger share of revenue, unlike current models where platforms take the majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:27">[00:49:27]</a>. The platform that cracks the highest frequency [[impact_of_metaverse_on_daily_life_and_industry | use case]] in the [[metaverse]] will likely gain the opportunity to own lower-frequency ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:47">[00:44:47]</a>.

## Virtual Influencers: A Glimpse into the Future

Virtual [[the_impact_of_social_media_and_influencer_culture | influencers]] are 3D-created characters that can theoretically exist in any [[metaverse]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:13">[00:59:13]</a>. Kyra, India's first virtual [[the_impact_of_social_media_and_influencer_culture | influencer]], has a backstory of coming from the [[metaverse]] to the real world and seeking her memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:27">[00:59:27]</a>. She has been tried in Decentraland and an "MG Verse" for Auto Expo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:48">[00:59:48]</a>.

Virtual [[the_impact_of_social_media_and_influencer_culture | influencers]] generate revenue through brand collaborations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:19">[01:00:19]</a> and music releases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:48">[01:00:48]</a>, similar to human [[the_impact_of_social_media_and_influencer_culture | influencers]]. Despite knowing they are not real, people follow virtual [[the_impact_of_social_media_and_influencer_culture | influencers]] due to character and storytelling, much like fictional characters in books or movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:30">[01:01:30]</a>.

## Key Players and [[role_of_technology_in_the_metaverse | Technology]] Powering the [[metaverse]]

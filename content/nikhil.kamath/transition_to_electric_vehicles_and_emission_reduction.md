The overall energy cycle involves generation, distribution, storage, and application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Transportation and Emissions

Transportation on the ground accounts for 50% of global CO2 emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## The Shift to Electric Vehicles

A [[electric_vehicle_industry_trends_and_challenges | transition to EV]]s is currently underway, particularly noticeable in scooters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Electric vehicles offer a significant reduction in emissions, being 40% less emissive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

### Reasons for Adoption
One primary driver for the shift to electric vehicles is the savings on fuel costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

### Key Resources
[[importance of lithium in the EV industry | Lithium]] is considered by some to be "the next Oil" due to its critical role in the EV industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### Alternative Fuels
For applications like buses, [[impact of green hydrogen on transportation CO2 emissions | hydrogen]] is being explored as an alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. An individual describes themselves as a "glorified Brewer of [[impact of green hydrogen on transportation CO2 emissions | green hydrogen]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

### EV Scooter Brands
Consumers considering an electric scooter might choose between brands like Ola or Ather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

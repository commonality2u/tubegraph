## The Choice to Work

Despite having been the richest man in the world for a significant period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, [[Bill Gates perspective on personal success and motivation | Bill Gates]] chooses to work, even though he does not have to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. He explains this choice simply by stating, "because it's fun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This perspective aligns with the economist John Maynard Keynes's question, posed decades ago, about what the world would do if one did not have to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Motivation for Achievement

The discussion touched on the idea that success in today's capitalistic world is often born from some form of adversity experienced in childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Examples cited include Steve Jobs, who was adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, and Elon Musk, who had a complicated relationship with his father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. It is suggested that many high achievers are driven by a need to prove something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This links to the broader topic of [[bill_gates_insights_on_childhood_influences_and_family_impact | childhood influences and family impact]] on personal success.

When asked if he is hard on himself, [[Bill Gates perspective on personal success and motivation | Bill Gates]] did not directly answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. It has been observed that he seems to care less about what people think of him now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, a trait that is seen as making him increasingly appealing to younger generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. This shift in [[Bill Gates perspective on public perception | public perception]] might influence his approach to work and his public persona.

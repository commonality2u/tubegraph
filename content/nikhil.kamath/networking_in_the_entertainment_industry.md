## Unexpected Connections
Within the entertainment industry, it can be surprising to find that leading figures, such as the heads of India's largest multiplex company, largest streaming company, and largest talent company, may not personally know one another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, a person with no direct involvement in [[Television and media | content]] creation can be friends with all three and facilitate introductions between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This act of connecting industry leaders is seen as a significant compliment to the individual making the introductions, suggesting they are doing something right in their networking efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

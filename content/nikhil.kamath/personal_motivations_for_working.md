Personal motivations for working extend beyond financial necessity, encompassing a drive for self-discipline, purpose, and even a philosophical engagement with how time is spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Self-Discipline and Drive
Working hard is linked to being "pretty hard on yourself" and avoiding self-deception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. For [[high_achievers_and_their_motivations | high achievers]], this constant engagement can be a source of enjoyment, as exemplified by a busy schedule in India involving meetings with politicians, described as "a lot of fun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Choice to Work
Even in scenarios where work is not a necessity, individuals may choose to continue working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. The idea of never needing to work is presented as a "different" concept for some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This highlights a deeper intrinsic drive beyond just earning a living.

## Future of Work and Purpose
The advent of advanced AI is projected to significantly free up time, potentially allowing for early retirement or shorter workweeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This future scenario necessitates a "philosophical rethink" about how time should be spent when mandatory work is reduced or eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Human Nature and Hierarchy
Regardless of economic necessity, humans are inclined to establish forms of hierarchy or segregation, suggesting that a state of absolute equality, as in "pure communism," is an "unnatural behavior" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This implies a continued human drive for differentiation and engagement, which may manifest through work or other activities.

## Balancing Profit and Philanthropy
A complex motivation can involve the simultaneous desire to make money and to give it away, illustrating a [[concept_of_motivational_pluralism_in_philanthropy_and_business | pluralistic approach]] to personal and professional goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

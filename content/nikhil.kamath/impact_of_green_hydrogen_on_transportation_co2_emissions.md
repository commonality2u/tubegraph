Transportation accounts for a significant portion of global CO2 emissions. Approximately 50% of global CO2 emissions originate from ground transportation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## [[transition_to_electric_vehicles_and_emission_reduction | Transition to Electric Vehicles]]

A notable [[transition_to_electric_vehicles_and_emission_reduction | transition to electric vehicles]] (EVs) is underway, particularly in sectors like scooters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This shift is driven by economic benefits, as moving to electric vehicles can lead to savings on fuel costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Electric scooters, for instance, are noted to have 40% less emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Role of Green Hydrogen

While the focus often lies on battery electric vehicles, green hydrogen is also being considered as a solution for certain transportation segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. For larger vehicles like buses, hydrogen is paradoxically being looked at as a primary option for fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

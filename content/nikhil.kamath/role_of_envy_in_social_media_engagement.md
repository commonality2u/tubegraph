Envy is considered a primary driver of social media engagement, manifesting in various ways and influencing user behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Envy as Fuel
The pervasive nature of envy online suggests it is "the fuel for social media" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:01">[02:05:01]</a>. This emotion plays out differently across various platforms and user interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Manifestations of Envy
*   **Social Hierarchy and Comparison**: When users post about experiences like holidays, it can be a subconscious attempt to establish a [[social_ladder | social hierarchy]], suggesting "I am doing this cool thing which you are not" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. This taps into the desire to be perceived as "cooler" or more successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.
*   **Idealized Lifestyles**: Platforms like Instagram can make users feel inadequate because the lifestyles portrayed are often "fancy," "aspirational," and even "unattainable" or "unreal," with "nobody's living that lifestyle they're portraying" daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:56">[02:03:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:09">[02:04:09]</a>. This disconnect can lead to feelings of inadequacy and contribute to [[impact_of_social_media_on_mental_health | mental health]] issues like depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:09">[02:00:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:14">[02:00:14]</a>.
*   **Negative Comments and "Cloud Farming"**: Envy is linked to "whiny" behavior and negativity on platforms like Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:18">[02:05:18]</a>. The "hate for influencers" and online figures is often "largely Envy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:23">[02:05:23]</a>. Users might intentionally post negative or "cheeky" comments on popular creators' pages, knowing that others who feel envious will "like" their comments, thereby gaining attention themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:10">[02:07:10]</a>. This phenomenon is termed "Cloud farming" by younger users, where people seek to gain popularity by "dunking on" prominent figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:30">[02:07:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:41">[02:07:41]</a>.
*   **Adherence to Trends**: The desire to be perceived as different or contrarian is influenced by what others are doing. If a popular sentiment emerges, a market for the "contrarian take" automatically forms, as people want to differentiate themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:34">[00:50:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:04">[00:51:04]</a>.

## Impact on Users
Social media's design, which provides [[social_media_and_dopamine_effects | dopamine hits]] through likes, shares, and comments, inherently exploits the human desire for acknowledgement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:04">[04:01:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:11">[05:09:11]</a>. This constant pursuit of validation can lead to an addictive cycle, particularly when platforms benefit financially from increased user engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:47">[08:47:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>.

The [[impact_of_social_media_on_mental_health | correlation between social media use and depression]] or insecurity is acknowledged as clear, with platforms often contributing to negative emotional states due to constant comparison and exposure to idealized versions of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:09">[02:00:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:14">[02:00:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:16">[02:00:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:39">[03:51:39]</a>.

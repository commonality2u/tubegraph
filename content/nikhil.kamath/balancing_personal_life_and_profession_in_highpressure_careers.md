The discussion explores how individuals navigate [[The Pursuit of Nontraditional Careers and Making It | unconventional careers]] that are high-pressure, specifically in the fields of acting, cricket, and music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. The conversation aims to uncover unique approaches that have led to success in these challenging domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, providing lessons for young aspirants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

## Kriti's Journey: From Shy Student to Actor

Kriti describes herself as a shy, studious, and nerdy child with stage fright <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Her mother, a professor, and father, a CA, instilled a pressure to perform well academically, aiming for 90% grades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. This drive stemmed from her mother's own life, where she had to fight for her dreams, like pursuing a PhD, against societal norms that expected women to marry instead of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. Kriti's mother also wanted to learn singing and swimming but was not allowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

Kriti notes that she feels "low" when not working, as her profession makes her "feel alive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>. She describes happiness as being "at peace" and having a "sense of calm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>. She feels that achieving a certain level of validation from her work, such as box office success or awards, has reduced the need to prove herself, allowing her to pursue roles that genuinely excite her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>. Despite this peace, she is still "happy restless," seeking new challenges to push herself to the next level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>. This state allows her to make choices without operating from insecurity or fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>.

Kriti's personal life is deeply intertwined with her family; she makes financial decisions collectively with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>. She views herself as an individual but her future mental image always includes her family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>. She admits to being somewhat detached from her family when busy with work, often receiving scoldings for not calling them daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>.

She overcame stage fright and insecurity by continually putting herself in scary situations and gaining confidence through work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:47">[00:41:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>. Her decision-making is influenced by a desire to constantly learn and grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>. This includes being open to asking "stupid" questions, which she believes is crucial for learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a>. Kriti highlights the importance of [[personal_challenges_and_resilience_in_career | persistence]] and not giving up after failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:56">[01:09:56]</a>. She believes her passion for acting developed over time, after starting in the field and discovering her aptitude for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:09">[01:15:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:10">[01:15:10]</a>.

On the challenge of aging in the industry, Kriti acknowledges the physical aspect of looking a certain way for roles, stressing the need to evolve and take on characters suitable for her age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:06">[02:20:06]</a>.

## Rahul's Journey: Obsession with Cricket and Seeking Balance

Rahul grew up in Mangalore, where his parents were also professors, with his dad teaching geology and his mom Indian history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:12">[00:57:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:46">[00:57:46]</a>. His passion for cricket started at a very young age, around two and a half years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:47">[00:58:47]</a>. His parents were supportive of his cricket aspirations but with a strict condition: his grades could not drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:56">[01:14:56]</a>. This conditional support is similar to Kriti's experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:13">[01:15:13]</a>.

Rahul believes in innate talent, especially in sports, where hand-eye coordination and the ability to judge ball speed are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:15">[01:03:15]</a>. He feels some abilities are "gifted" and cannot be entirely taught, placing him on the side of "nature versus nurture" in talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:40">[01:05:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:48">[01:05:48]</a>.

Rahul finds peace and grounding by visiting temples, not to seek forgiveness or thanks, but to reflect on his humble beginnings and be grateful for his current success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:16">[01:20:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:22">[01:20:22]</a>. This act helps him remember his goals and prevents him from worrying about the future or falling into the trap of overachieving, which he says has led to setbacks in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:38">[01:23:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:45">[01:23:45]</a>. He aims to maintain a mindset of joy and fun in his sport, as it was in his childhood, rather than being driven by desperation or pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:47">[01:24:47]</a>.

On [[Handling external pressures and expectations in startups | handling trolling and external pressures]], Rahul admits it has massively scarred him, especially after a public suspension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:57">[01:27:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:37">[01:28:37]</a>. He deals with it by staying off Instagram and avoiding comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:47">[01:32:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:43">[01:33:43]</a>. He also recharges by returning to Bangalore to spend time with childhood friends, creating a space where "nothing enters that room" â€“ no trolling, no success, just genuine connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:51">[01:31:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:02">[01:32:02]</a>.

Rahul emphasizes the importance of [[personal_challenges_and_resilience_in_career | being your own team]] and fighting battles alone without leaning on others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:55">[01:34:55]</a>. He considers himself lucky to have always known his dream of becoming a cricketer, never needing a Plan B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:47">[01:35:47]</a>.

He highlights the challenge of a finite career curve for athletes, with an end in sight around age 40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:36">[02:16:36]</a>. Hitting age 30 brought the realization that his career was not far from over, causing anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:46">[02:17:46]</a>. This led him to start thinking about businesses and investments during Covid-19, seeking guidance to ensure a smooth transition post-cricket and maintain financial stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:21">[02:18:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:44">[02:18:44]</a>.

For Rahul, relationships, particularly with his partner, are crucial for stability and focus, providing a "safe space" and keeping him grounded regardless of performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:57">[02:29:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:22">[02:32:22]</a>.

## Badshah's Journey: From Engineer to Rapper

Badshah, originally Aditya, was an engineer from Delhi, whose parents worked for the government and as a teacher, respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:24">[01:44:24]</a>. He started writing at a young age as a way to express himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:36">[02:01:36]</a>, initially rhyming along to songs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:27">[02:02:27]</a>. His first big break came from writing for Honey Singh while working as a government officer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:26">[02:08:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:50">[02:08:50]</a>. He later learned music production through YouTube tutorials and produced his own hit song, "Saturday Saturday" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:10">[02:12:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:09">[02:11:09]</a>.

Badshah expresses that he is a very emotional person and finds tears to be an overwhelming outlet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:24">[01:43:24]</a>. When asked for advice on becoming popular and rich in music, he jokingly suggests getting into stocks instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:03">[02:13:03]</a>. He asserts that true passion for music is the prerequisite for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:25">[02:13:25]</a>, and that "not giving up" is the biggest challenge and key virtue for longevity in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:05">[02:14:05]</a>.

## Universal Themes and Advice

*   **Passion vs. Profit:** The discussion touches upon [[balancing_passion_and_profitability_in_careers | balancing passion and profitability]]. It's suggested that industries driven by passion, like entertainment or restaurants, are harder to succeed in financially, compared to more "boring" but profitable sectors like energy transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:35">[01:48:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:08">[01:52:08]</a>.

Both agree that relentless learning and asking questions are vital for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>.

*   **Coping with Pressure and Failure:** [[Overcoming challenges in offbeat careers | Overcoming challenges]] involves embracing uncomfortable situations and continually pushing oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>. Failures are part of the process, and the ability to get up and try again is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>. [[Balancing optimism and realism in business growth | Realism about outcomes]] and the willingness to pivot quickly from non-working projects is also advised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:19">[02:39:19]</a>.
*   **[[Role of Detachment and Indifference in Personal and Professional Life | Detachment and Peace]]:** While not advocating for complete indifference, the idea of cultivating a sense of peace despite external pressures is discussed.

    *   **Realistic Expectations:** Be willing to ditch projects quickly if they are not gaining traction, as time is the most finite resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:50">[02:39:50]</a>.

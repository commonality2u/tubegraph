The Bollywood industry, despite its glamour, faces significant challenges and is currently undergoing a transformative period marked by changing audience tastes and evolving distribution models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:08">[00:45:08]</a>.

## Industry Challenges and Monetization
There's a perception that for every 1,000 rupees invested in making Bollywood movies, the net outcome today is less than 1,000 rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:24">[00:45:24]</a>. The distribution channels, including multiplexes, single screens, and streaming platforms, are all struggling to monetize Bollywood films in the way they once could <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>. This struggle is largely attributed to shifting audience tastes, which the industry has not always listened to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:10">[00:46:10]</a>.

## Changing Audience Tastes: Aspiration vs. Relatability
Historically, Bollywood films were characterized by an aspirational quality, with audiences wanting to feel better and look at movies to feel better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:31">[00:46:31]</a>. However, with the rise of [[impact_of_ott_platforms_on_cinema | OTT platforms]] and a growing emphasis on "relatability," the game has changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>. Audiences now prioritize relatability in dialogue, screenplay, performance, delivery, and even on-screen styling, over the previous aspirational focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:10">[00:47:10]</a>. The industry has been working to bridge this gap, with some projects, especially on OTT, successfully incorporating this shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:29">[00:47:29]</a>.

## Film Production and Narrative Shifts
Filmmakers are now exploring new narratives that resonate with contemporary audiences. For instance, the film *Apurva* (Tara's character's name) is a survival drama about a young girl who uses her wit and intelligence to save herself, a departure from traditional narratives where the female lead is often saved by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:51">[00:47:51]</a>. This raw and realistic approach is expected to resonate with young audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:29">[00:48:29]</a>.

There is also an interest in creating musicals that are either relatable or aspirational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:26">[00:49:26]</a>. While direct Hindi remakes of Broadway productions are considered difficult due to differing experiences, adapting elements from international stories or exploring Indian subjects like the 1970s, 80s, and 90s nightlife with jazz clubs and incorporating great music, is seen as a potential path forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:33">[00:49:33]</a>.

## The Cinema-Going Experience
Despite the growth of [[impact_of_ott_platforms_on_cinema | OTT platforms]], the cinema experience remains irreplaceable for many Indians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51">[01:11:51]</a>. It offers a unique communal and societal experience where people can come together for a few hours, forget their worries, enjoy food, and bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:21">[01:12:21]</a>.

However, the penetration of multiplexes in India is significantly low compared to other countries. India has about 9,000 screens in total, with only around 2,000 being multiplex screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:14">[01:13:14]</a>. The access to a multiplex in the US is roughly one for every 30-40 people, while in India, it's about 1/100th of that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:20">[01:13:20]</a>. The assumed growth of multiplexes in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, driven by the appeal of a safe, clean, air-conditioned family experience, has not materialized as expected, partly due to cumbersome regulations related to fire safety that make costs prohibitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:55">[01:13:55]</a>.

The merger of Inox and PVR suggests a shift towards premiumizing the cinema experience to attract audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:10">[01:15:10]</a>.

## Influencers vs. Actors
The rise of influencers on social media, particularly on platforms like Instagram, has sparked debate about their potential threat to Bollywood actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:47">[02:07:47]</a>. While the line may appear to be blurring, it is argued that acting and influencing are separate fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:56">[02:08:56]</a>. Influencers can monetize their platforms, earning substantial wages, although this requires significant energy, time, and strategic thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:08">[02:09:08]</a>.

The trend of young people aspiring to be influencers is seen as a "sexy thing to do," sometimes pursued for superficial reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:46">[02:10:46]</a>. The "right reason" to be an influencer, however, is considered to be genuine passion, such as a financial influencer educating people about basic financial principles to improve their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:12">[02:11:12]</a>. Ultimately, the impact of influencers depends on individual consumption choices, as platforms like Instagram offer a wide range of content, from genuine to "pointless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.

Influencers, like all individuals who post content, have a responsibility for what they promote and sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:47">[02:09:47]</a>.

[[Entrepreneurship and women in tech | Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw]] began her entrepreneurial journey with what she describes as "foolish courage" due to the inherent risks and societal perceptions she faced as a woman [00:00:12, 00:30:26]. Despite lacking initial capital and business experience, her passion for entrepreneurship and exciting ideas drove her forward [00:00:06, 00:22:47].

## Early Challenges and Gender Bias

From the outset, Mazumdar-Shaw encountered significant gender-based obstacles:
*   **Brewing Industry Exclusion** After completing her Brewing Masters in Australia, where she was the only woman in her class in a male-dominated field, she faced rejection for brewmaster positions in India [00:06:19, 00:06:22, 00:15:17]. Breweries cited her gender as a "big risk," stating they had no women in leadership and doubted her ability to handle "hostile labor unions" [00:15:20, 00:15:31, 00:15:35]. She realized the country was "not ready for a woman brewmaster" [00:15:44, 00:15:48].
*   **Entering the Business World** When approached by an Irish biotech entrepreneur to start a company in India, Mazumdar-Shaw initially resisted, stating, "This is not a country that is welcoming of women in business" [00:19:22]. She felt unwelcome not only in brewing but also in the broader business world [00:19:30, 00:19:33]. In 1978, there were very few prominent women running large businesses in India [00:20:02, 00:20:14].

## Funding and Hiring Difficulties

Starting Biocon at 25, with only 10,000 rupees in her bank and no business experience, Mazumdar-Shaw was seen as "high risk" by everyone, especially bankers [00:30:34, 00:30:50, 00:30:56].
*   **Banker Reluctance** Banks often demanded her father's guarantee, a principle she refused, highlighting the gender bias by questioning why a male entrepreneur's guarantee would suffice but hers would not [00:31:21, 00:31:38, 00:31:40]. It took "one Brave Banker" from Canara Bank, Dinesh Nayak, who was inspired by her story, to finally offer her a credit line [00:33:51, 00:34:05, 00:34:08].
*   **Hiring Challenges** She found it "very difficult to hire people" because many did not want to work for a woman [00:31:46, 00:31:47, 00:31:49]. Her first two employees were retired tractor mechanics who desperately needed a job and were indifferent to her gender [00:31:50, 00:31:55]. Over time, however, as her company grew and gained recognition, she was able to attract "the brightest Minds" [00:32:05, 00:32:07].

## Modern Challenges for Women in Business

Despite progress, Mazumdar-Shaw notes that challenges persist for women entrepreneurs, particularly in fundraising and workforce representation:
*   **Venture Capital Bias** She highlights that most venture funds tend to invest in male-run businesses because "the money is in the hands of men," who feel "more comfortable investing in Ventures run by men" [01:32:51, 01:33:07, 01:33:09, 01:33:10, 01:33:13]. Women still face a "big challenge to raise Equity to raise Capital" [01:33:17, 01:33:19, 01:33:22].
*   **Leadership and Board Representation** While ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) initiatives have increased focus on including women in the economic mainstream, the presence of women on corporate boards is often minimal, typically just one woman due to statutory requirements [01:32:37, 01:32:41, 01:32:48, 01:34:16, 01:34:20, 01:34:26, 01:34:29]. Mazumdar-Shaw advocates for boards to have 30-40% women [01:34:39].
*   **Workforce Representation** India's female labor force participation is "very low" compared to other geographies [01:31:37, 01:31:40]. In specific industries like pharmaceutical sales and manufacturing, male dominance remains high [01:36:35, 01:36:37, 01:37:00, 01:37:11, 01:37:14]. Mazumdar-Shaw actively challenges these ratios within her own companies, setting targets to increase women's representation [01:35:36, 01:35:39, 01:37:02]. Changes in government policy allowing women to work in multiple shifts are expected to help change these dynamics [01:37:54, 01:37:56, 01:37:58].

Mazumdar-Shaw believes that while there are still [[challenges_faced_by_startups_in_india | challenges for startups in India]], the world is changing, and she is confident that significant progress for women in business will be seen within the next decade [01:34:10, 01:34:12, 01:35:12, 01:35:15].

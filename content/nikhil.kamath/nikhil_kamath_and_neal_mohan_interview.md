This article summarizes a conversation between [[Nikhil Kamaths early life and career journey | Nikhil Kamath]] and Neal Mohan, the CEO of YouTube, covering topics from the purpose of the 'Waves' event to the future of content creation and AI's impact.

## Defining 'Waves'
Neal Mohan describes 'Waves' as a pioneering gathering, possibly the first globally, that brings together individuals with a vested interest in the creative industries. Its primary objective is to accelerate the growth of Indian culture and creators, with an anticipated global impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. The event reflects the recognition that India is on the cusp of becoming a major creator nation, a trend evident in YouTube's numbers and interactions in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. 'Waves' combines cultural, creative, business, and collaborative aspects, including private-government partnerships, to integrate all these elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

## YouTube as an Information and Creator Platform
YouTube's mission is to give everyone a voice and show them the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>. The platform serves as a reflection of global happenings, including politics, elections, and societal conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. Mohan asserts that YouTube does not control the narrative; instead, it reflects what is interesting to the user based on their viewing habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. Users are in the driver's seat, and creators are responsible for producing engaging content to build an audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.

### The Rise of Podcasts on YouTube
Podcasters and news commentators played a significant role in recent US elections by reaching large audiences through YouTube, leveraging it as a direct outlet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. YouTube's success with podcasts is attributed to three foundational bets:
*   **Watching conversations:** The belief that people would prefer to watch, not just listen to, podcasts, a trend accelerated by COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>.
*   **Discovery:** Investing in algorithms to help users discover podcasts they might be genuinely interested in, beyond their subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>.
*   **Monetization:** Integrating podcasts into the YouTube partner program to help creators monetize their content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>.

### Traditional News vs. Podcasters
[[Nikhil Kamaths early life and career journey | Nikhil Kamath]] suggests a public disillusionment with corporate-owned news channels, leading audiences to independent podcasters perceived as less biased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>. Mohan clarifies that it's not an "either-or" situation; traditional news channels also find success on YouTube by adopting its content style, including live broadcasts and replays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>. He emphasizes that podcasters cover news using "creator tools," allowing for a deeper, personal connection with their audience beyond just the information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>.

## YouTube's Identity and Future
Mohan defines YouTube as a unique streaming service where users can watch, create, and share video regardless of location or device, spanning from living room screens to mobile phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:36:00">[13:36:00]</a>. He distinguishes YouTube from social media, as its primary purpose is video consumption, and from linear television, due to its creator-led content generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:00]</a>.

> [!quote] Building the Stage
> Mohan uses the analogy of building a "stage" to describe YouTube's role: "most of the people at YouTube...are software engineers or technologists and our job is to build the stage and I want that to be the best possible stage in the world." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:06:00">[15:06:00]</a> YouTube focuses on creating tools and capabilities for creators to shine, allowing them full creative and editorial control, unlike traditional media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:00">[16:03:00]</a>.

### Future of Content Consumption
Mohan predicts continued growth for YouTube content, especially on living room screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:31:00">[18:31:00]</a>. He highlights the "creator-led content production" as a significant phenomenon, viewing creators as the "startups of Hollywood" and Bollywood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:44:00">[18:44:00]</a>. This relatively new trend is expected to become mainstream, with independent creators establishing their own studios and producing content differently from traditional large studios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:08:00">[19:08:00]</a>.

> [!info] AI and Creativity
> Mohan views [[Aravind Srinivass experience with machine learning and AI | AI]] as a tool that enhances human creativity rather than replacing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:00:00">[20:00:00]</a>. He believes it will empower more creators to produce high-quality content by automating complex tasks, leading to new opportunities but also disrupting existing parts of the value chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:34:00">[53:34:00]</a>.

Younger generations expect all their favorite content, from shorts to long-form videos, live streams, and games, to be available in one place and consumable on any device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:53:00">[20:53:00]</a>. This expectation will lead to even greater diversity in consumer choice in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:18:00">[21:18:00]</a>.

### Competition and Piracy
Mohan emphasizes YouTube's unique approach, focusing on being a leader in technology and providing tools for creators, rather than becoming like other streaming services such as Netflix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:47:00">[21:47:00]</a>. The sheer volume and diversity of content from its 100 million creators, including 15,000 in India with over a million subscribers, is YouTube's strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:18:00">[22:18:00]</a>.

Regarding piracy for filmmakers, YouTube has heavily invested in Digital Rights Management (DRM) tools to prevent unauthorized copying. While not perfect, they aim to create friction for direct copying and have a strong control point over the distribution of pirated content on their platform through policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:32:00">[23:32:00]</a>.

## Advice for Aspiring Entrepreneurs and Creators
For young Indian aspiring [[Entrepreneurship and Nikhil Kamath | entrepreneurs]], Mohan advises focusing on YouTube as a "home for creators," where the primary goal is the act of creation, not just selling a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:07:00">[26:07:00]</a>.

> [!info] Key [[Insights from experienced founders | Insights]] for Creators
> 1.  **Direct Connection:** Platforms like YouTube remove barriers between creators and their audience/customers, allowing direct control over the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:14:00">[48:14:00]</a>.
> 2.  **Instant Feedback:** Creators receive immediate feedback via comments, allowing for rapid iteration and adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:30:00">[48:30:00]</a>.
> 3.  **Global Reach:** Content tends to be global, with storylines translating across cultures, offering opportunities for local, regional, and national ambitions to reach worldwide audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:00:00">[49:00:00]</a>.
> 4.  **Multi-Screen Modality:** Content consumption is increasingly multi-screen, with a significant portion viewed on television screens, an important factor for content production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:29:00">[49:29:00]</a>.
> 5.  **Diverse Monetization:** While advertising is core, entrepreneurs should explore other monetization models like subscriptions (SVOD), direct fan funding for niche content, and shopping/merchandise integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:11:00">[50:11:00]</a>.

Mohan stresses two crucial pieces of advice for building a career on YouTube:
*   **Passion and Authenticity:** Create content about topics you are genuinely passionate about. Authenticity resonates with fans, who will quickly discern insincerity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:08:00">[29:08:00]</a>.
*   **Patience and Time:** YouTube can be a "slow burn." Give it time to build an audience and set expectations for your content, as follower growth and algorithmic visibility build over time as a reflection of audience engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:41:00">[30:41:00]</a>.

## Neal Mohan's Personal Perspective
Mohan identifies his passions as technology and media (stories, movies, music, sports), which YouTube uniquely combines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:06:00">[32:06:00]</a>. He maintains an "even-keeled" and quiet demeanor, which he believes is beneficial for work, allowing for well-considered judgment, especially when faced with difficult decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:06:00">[35:06:00]</a>. His childhood in Lucknow and exposure to diverse media, including early Bollywood and the advent of platforms like Star, fostered his interest in storytelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:38:00">[37:38:00]</a>. He emphasizes that humans are inherently storytellers, connecting through shared narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:41:00">[40:41:00]</a>.

## India's Creative Economy and Global Impact
Mohan highlights the tremendous success of [[Next generation thinking in India | India]] on YouTube, citing statistics such as four out of five Indians using the platform, billions of hours of content consumed, and 100 million channels uploading videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:41:00">[44:41:00]</a>. Indian creators generated $2.5 billion (21,000 crores) on YouTube in the last three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:56:00">[44:56:00]</a>. He notes the vibrant [[Entrepreneurship and Nikhil Kamath | entrepreneurial]] spirit of Indian creators, who are willing to work hard and invest in their passions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:13:00">[45:13:00]</a>. Notably, about 15% of content created by Indian creators is consumed outside India, making India an "exporter of ideas and culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:50:00">[45:50:00]</a>.

## The Role of AI in Content Creation
Mohan sees [[Opportunities for Indian entrepreneurs in AI and tech advancements | AI]] as a disruptive force that will provide new tools for creators. He gives examples like Dream Screen, a feature allowing creators to generate complex video sets from a simple text prompt in seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:17:00">[52:17:00]</a>. He also mentions the potential for AI to provide high-quality, tone-preserving translations for videos in thousands of languages, democratizing access to content for a global audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:04:00">[56:04:00]</a>. AI can also assist creators with ideation, helping them overcome the "blank screen problem" by suggesting content ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:42:00">[56:42:00]</a>.

## Attention Spans and Content Formats
Mohan observes that YouTube sees a wide range of consumption patterns, from short-form content (like Shorts) to increasingly longer and more episodic long-form content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:36:00">[57:36:00]</a>. He views shorts as a continuum, similar to the early days of YouTube's shorter videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:08:00">[58:08:00]</a>. Attention spans are not necessarily falling, but rather users engage in long sessions with both short and long content, indicating a diverse preference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:47:00">[58:47:00]</a>.

## YouTube in the Music and Learning Landscape
Mohan acknowledges that learning is a significant and valued use case on YouTube across all demographics, with over 90% of classroom teachers using the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:11:00">[01:00:11:00]</a>. He highlights diverse learning niches, from academic subjects to practical skills and esoteric hobbies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:25:00">[01:00:25:00]</a>.

Despite the interviewer's personal shift to Spotify for music, Mohan affirms that music remains YouTube's oldest and most important vertical, core to its heritage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:13:00">[01:03:13:00]</a>. He notes the growth of Indian pop music and artists like King who rose on YouTube, and plans to further invest in showcasing diverse Indian music through features like popular charts across languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00:00">[01:03:00:00]</a>.

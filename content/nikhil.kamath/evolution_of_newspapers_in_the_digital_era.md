The question of whether [[the_decline_of_traditional_media | old school media is dying]] and if digital creators will take over is largely answered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. At a high level, any business that fails to transform itself every five to seven years is likely to cease to exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The average lifespan of a company on the S&P 500 is only about 15 years, suggesting that all businesses are, in a sense, "destined to die" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Historical Significance and Current Decline

Historically, the newspaper was the first widespread medium through which people accessed information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This liberation of society from more dictatorial systems marked a significant era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. However, across the globe, newspaper readership and print circulation are experiencing a steady decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

> "If you look at any place in the world newspaper readership is dying... print circulation is dying or slowly dying." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>

## Digital Transformation and the Paywall Model

In response to these [[trends_in_media_and_content_consumption | trends in media and content consumption]], many "smart companies" within the newspaper industry are adapting by moving their content behind paywalls, offering very premium digital content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Notable examples include The Economist and The New York Times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

The view is that newspapers must significantly morph their business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. While physical print might remain as an "add-on," their primary business will increasingly need to be [[the_impact_of_digital_technology | digitally driven]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. This parallels the [[transformation_of_tv_into_digital_content_platforms | transformation of TV into digital content platforms]], where devices are becoming smart and IP-based delivery is replacing traditional broadcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This shift empowers [[the_rise_of_personalized_content_and_ott_platforms | personalized content]] consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

A chef working in a busy kitchen is ranked among the three most stressful jobs in the world, alongside a stockbroker and a soldier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Historically, the profession of a chef was largely unheard of for women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, adding a layer to the [[challenges_of_being_a_chef | challenges of being a chef]] within the industry.

## Regulatory Hurdles and Operational Strain

Opening a culinary establishment can be fraught with significant regulatory challenges, contributing to the overall stress. For instance, to sell a sandwich, 36 licenses and No-Objection Certificates (NOCs) are required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This extensive regulatory environment, which includes [[licensing_and_regulations_in_the_food_industry | licensing and regulations in the food industry]], highlights the complexities of [[navigating the restaurant industry's regulatory environment | navigating the restaurant industry's regulatory environment]] and can be a major source of stress when considering [[challenges and success stories of opening a restaurant | challenges and success stories of opening a restaurant]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## The "Don't Die" Framework

A proposed philosophical framework, known as "don't die," is multifaceted, encompassing economic, political, moral, and social dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Core Principles
The framework is built upon fundamental rules:
*   **Don't kill each other** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **Don't kill the planet** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### Alignment with AI
A key aspect of this philosophy is the imperative to align artificial intelligence (AI) with the "don't die" principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### Ethical Considerations
The framework raises questions about ethical dilemmas that might arise from the pursuit of survival, such as situations where an individual's survival could necessitate extreme or harmful actions against others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Personal Approaches to [[longevity_and_health | Longevity and Health]]

### Individual Measurement and Data
One participant identifies as "the most measured person in human history," suggesting a data-driven approach to personal health and well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The importance of data is further emphasized by the idea that Apple and Samsung will be major owners of health-related data due to wearable technology like watches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. For countries like India to advance in healthcare AI, developing their own datasets is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

### Dietary and Supplement Choices
Discussions among individuals include their personal consumption of [[longevity_and_health | longevity supplements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. There is a general disclaimer that no one should replicate the specific diets or supplements discussed by the speakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. One individual mentions finding growth hormone in their bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, while another expresses interest in growing their own vegetables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### Future Treatments
The conversation touches upon seeking specific treatments for health issues, with one person expressing a willingness to do "anything" if a single treatment could resolve their problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This suggests a pursuit of targeted interventions, possibly linking to the field of [[precision_medicine_and_longevity | precision medicine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

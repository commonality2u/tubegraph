## The Unreliable Nature of Brands

From a creator's perspective, brands are characterized as unreliable entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. It is asserted that "brands are not your friends" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Furthermore, they are portrayed as quick to abandon commitments, being "the first to chicken out [and] get cancelled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

This perspective highlights a transactional relationship with brands, particularly when creating "English content," which is often done "for the money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. In contrast, "Hindi content" is pursued "for the power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, suggesting a different motivation beyond financial gain.

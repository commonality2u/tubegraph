Bollywood, a dynamic and competitive industry, faces significant shifts in audience tastes, distribution models, and the very nature of content creation. The conversation around its future emphasizes adaptability, authenticity, and understanding the nuances of a changing consumer landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:10">[00:46:10]</a>.

## Current State and Challenges

The industry is currently grappling with a situation where the net outcome from film production (if 1,000 rupees go into making a Bollywood movie, the net outcome is less than 1,000 rupees) indicates a difficult period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:24">[00:45:24]</a>. Distribution channels, including multiplexes, single screens, and streaming platforms, are all experiencing challenges in monetizing Bollywood content as effectively as before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:55">[00:45:55]</a>.

This decline is attributed to changing audience tastes, which the industry may not have listened to adequately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:10">[00:46:10]</a>. Historically, there was a strong aspirational quality to films, where people went to the movies to feel better and uplifted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:34">[00:46:34]</a>. However, with the rise of OTT platforms, "relatability" has become a major driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:54">[00:46:54]</a>. Audiences now seek content where elements like dialogue, screenplay, performance, and styling feel genuine and relatable, rather than solely aspirational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>.

### The Role of Theatrical Experience
Despite the growth of OTT, the theatrical experience remains irreplaceable for many in India across all age groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:55">[01:11:55]</a>. It serves as a community and societal outing, allowing people to forget worries for a few hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:21">[01:12:21]</a>. However, the penetration of multiplexes in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities has not increased as anticipated due to factors like high regulatory costs, particularly concerning fire safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:55">[01:13:55]</a>. This has led multiplexes to explore "premiumization" of the experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:10">[01:15:10]</a>.

## Changing Tastes and Content Direction

The younger generation is "craving the kind of films that we grew up loving and watching" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:40">[02:06:40]</a>, such as rom-coms, situational comedies, and other fun, lighter genres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:51">[02:06:51]</a>. While serious and meaningful cinema is important, especially for a "thinking generation," there's a strong desire for happier content, particularly after challenging times like the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. Recent successes like "Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani" exemplify this trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:14">[02:07:14]</a>.

### New Narratives
There's an increasing demand for stories where characters, particularly women, use their wit and intelligence to save themselves, rather than being saved by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:12">[00:48:12]</a>. Tara's upcoming film, "Apurva," a solo-led survival drama, embodies this shift, showcasing a raw and real narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:51">[00:47:51]</a>.

### Musical Films
A potential area for growth is musical films that incorporate Indian cultural elements and music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:11">[00:49:11]</a>. While direct remakes of Broadway shows may not work due to differing experiences, adapting stories with themes like jazz clubs from the 70s, 80s, and 90s could resonate with audiences who love great music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:02">[00:50:02]</a>.

## Personal [[journey_and_experiences_in_bollywood | Journey and Experiences in Bollywood]]

Tara Sutaria's entry into Bollywood was unusual, as she had no prior connection to the industry and didn't grow up watching Hindi films, unlike most people in her line of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:42">[00:39:42]</a>. Growing up in Mumbai, she and her twin sister were drawn to the arts from a young age, with parents encouraging them towards theater and music rather than just academia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:08">[00:35:08]</a>. She performed in operas from age six at the NCPA in Mumbai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>. Her mother, an amazing singer, also taught her etiquette and personality development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>. Tara was also an ambassador for Disney in India at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:11">[00:40:11]</a>.

Her career began through an introduction by Rishmati, owner of Matrix, who saw Tara's theater work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>. This led to a meeting with Karan Johar, who became her guide, mentor, and producer for her first film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:24">[00:41:24]</a>. Her debut filming experience at 20 or 21 felt safe, happy, and genuine, largely due to her prior experience in dance, theater, and Disney projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:19">[00:43:19]</a>.

## Impact of Influencers on Bollywood

While there is a perception that the line between influencers and Bollywood actors is blurring, Tara does not view influencers as a direct threat to the traditional film industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:48">[02:08:48]</a>. She sees them as separate entities, as acting requires a different skill set and experience compared to creating social media content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:56">[02:08:56]</a>.

There is a growing trend of young people aspiring to be influencers, often for "wrong reasons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:51">[02:10:51]</a>. The "right reason" to pursue influencing, as exemplified by financial influencers, stems from a genuine passion for educating people or sharing valuable insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:22">[02:11:22]</a>. However, the general sentiment is that the influencer persona has become "sexy," leading to pursuits for superficial reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:43">[02:10:43]</a>.

The rise of influencers means that audiences must discern what content and individuals they choose to consume and believe in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:48">[02:11:48]</a>. While platforms like Instagram offer a mix of superficial influencer content, they also host valuable content and genuine creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:06">[02:12:06]</a>.

## [[bollywood_insights | Bollywood insights]] and Future Outlook

Bollywood needs to address the gap between audience expectations of relatability and the industry's historical emphasis on aspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:27">[00:47:27]</a>. This means creating films that genuinely connect with the everyday lives and experiences of audiences, rather than solely showcasing larger-than-life scenarios.

The industry also needs to adapt to the evolving landscape of content consumption. While theatrical releases will likely always hold a special place, investing in diverse content for OTT platforms that prioritizes authenticity and new narratives will be crucial for sustained engagement and growth.

The competitive nature of Bollywood means that individuals must find their unique voice and contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>. Being true to oneself and one's values, rather than conforming to perceived industry norms, is seen as essential for long-term relevance and combating negative phenomena like trolling and cancel culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:51">[02:27:51]</a>.

New Zealand's cultural identity is enriched by its indigenous Māori population and their vibrant performing arts. Efforts are made to foster international connections through cultural exchange, notably with countries like India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

## Indigenous Māori Culture

The Māori are the indigenous people of [[new_zealand_cultural_practices | New Zealand]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Their culture is characterized by its innovative spirit, stemming from their ancestors, the Polynesian navigators, who used stars to journey across the Pacific to New Zealand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

Key aspects of Māori performing arts include:
*   **Kapahaka** These are Māori performing arts traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Haka** A ceremonial dance or challenge, an example of which was performed by a Member of Parliament at Parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

There is significant global respect for Māori culture, with an appreciation for its depth and history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

## Cultural Exchange with India

During a visit to India, a large delegation from New Zealand included an indigenous Kapahaka performing arts team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. This initiative aimed to deepen the [[relationship_between_india_and_new_zealand | relationship between India and New Zealand]] at a "people-to-people level" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. The New Zealand Prime Minister expressed pride in bringing "some of our best exponents" of Māori culture to India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

A notable planned event during the visit was a performance by the Kapahaka team in front of the Taj Mahal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. The cultural exchange was also set against the backdrop of sporting events, such as the [[new_zealand_cricket | India New Zealand cricket final]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

The distinction between acting with a mission and acting with ambition is crucial for those entering [[involvement_in_politics | politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Good individuals who enter politics should do so with a mission rather than mere ambition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Calling for "Good People"

There is a consistent need for "good people" to engage in [[involvement_in_politics | politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. These individuals are expected to approach their roles with a defined mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. For instance, when an individual became Chief Minister, they acknowledged their own fallibility as a human being, not a deity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Societal Perceptions

Growing up in a South Indian middle-class family, it was a common sentiment that [[involvement_in_politics | politics]] is "a dirty place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. This perception has become so deeply ingrained in the collective psyche that it is extremely difficult to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This negative view may contribute to why distinguishing between mission and ambition is vital for fostering trust and encouraging positive [[youth_involvement_in_politics | youth involvement in politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

> "If a [[youth_involvement_in_politics | youth]] today wants to become a politician, then he must have some talent which you can test. Good people should keep coming in politics. They have come with a mission not with ambition." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>

## Parallels with Entrepreneurship

Interestingly, there are many similarities between [[parallels_between_politics_and_entrepreneurship | politics and entrepreneurship]] that have not been widely discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This suggests that the drive, talent, and ethical considerations—whether mission-driven or ambition-driven—may share common ground across both fields.

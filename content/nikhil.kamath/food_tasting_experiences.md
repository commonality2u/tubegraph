Questions arose regarding the origin of dishes such as the "Kima" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a> and a prawn dish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Unique Dessert Ingredients

A [[Dessert offerings | dessert]] was presented, prompting speculation about its [[Unique food ingredients | unique ingredients]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Initial guesses included items like a "grasshopper" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. It was subsequently revealed that the dessert contained "red ants" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

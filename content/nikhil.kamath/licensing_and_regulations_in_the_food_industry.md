The process of [[navigating_the_restaurant_industrys_regulatory_environment | navigating the restaurant industry's regulatory environment]] can be complex, particularly when it comes to obtaining the necessary permits and licenses. The industry, particularly in India, is characterized as a "crash course in restaurant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, implying its demanding nature.

## Bureaucratic Hurdles

A significant challenge highlighted is the sheer number of licenses and "no's" required for seemingly simple operations. To sell a sandwich, for example, a business might need 36 licenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This is presented in stark contrast to the 14 licenses reportedly needed to open an arms factory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, illustrating the perceived difficulty and bureaucratic burden within the food sector.

This high number of requirements can be a major hurdle for entrepreneurs aiming to build for India, especially those targeting micro-markets, where generic approaches are advised against <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

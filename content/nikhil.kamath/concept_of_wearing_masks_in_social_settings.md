The concept of individuals "wearing a mask" in social interactions suggests that people present different versions of themselves depending on their surroundings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This idea delves into how individuals manage their [[public_perception_and_personal_image | public perception and personal image]] and adapt their [[personal_relationships_and_identity | personal relationships and identity]] in various contexts.

## The Idea of Social Masks

It is suggested that "deep down we are all wearing a mask" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. The nature of this "mask" is depicted as fluid, as "The mask changes depending on who we are sitting around" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This dynamic behavior highlights a facet of [[impact_of_social_media_on_personal_identity | personal identity]] and adaptation within social environments.

## Individual Perspectives

When questioned about which "masks" work and which he uses, YouTube CEO Neil Mohan responded:
> I'm not very sophisticated in masks. So what you see is what you get. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>

This statement implies a preference for a direct and consistent presentation of self rather than adapting to different social "masks."

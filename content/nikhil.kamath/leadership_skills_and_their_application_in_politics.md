The transition from a business career to [[leadership_and_politics | political leadership]] is a journey that involves both transferable skills and the necessity to unlearn certain approaches. Chris, a former business leader at Unilever and Air New Zealand before becoming the Prime Minister of New Zealand, shares insights into this unique path.

## [[transition_from_business_to_politics | Transition from Business to Politics]]
For Chris, the move into [[leadership_and_politics | political life]] was driven by a commitment to public service and a desire to improve citizens' livelihoods [07:54]. He views the privilege of leading a country as "very, very special," despite its inherent challenges [07:41]. Coming from outside the traditional political system, Chris believes his "outside-in perspective" is beneficial for identifying areas for national improvement [08:05]. He anticipated entering [[political_aspirations_and_involvement | political life]] at some point, recognizing the value of prior experience in other sectors [08:31]. This background helps in understanding the world better and how to assist people [08:54].

## Transferable Skills from Business to Politics
While running a company differs significantly from governing a country, many principles of [[leadership_and_politics | leadership]] are transferable [09:09]. Chris highlights several key skills:
*   **Balancing Preservation and Change** A crucial task for any leader, whether a CEO or Prime Minister, is finding the right balance between "protecting and enhancing the good things" and "provok[ing] and stimul[ating] change" [09:53]. Constant change without stability, or excessive incrementalism, both fail to move an agenda forward [10:05].
*   **Humility and Learning** Chris emphasized the importance of being "prepared to start at the beginning" in a new sphere, not assuming past success guarantees future success [10:41]. Remaining humble and curious about new knowledge is vital for progress in a [[political_aspirations_and_involvement | political career]] [10:46].
*   **Character and Temperament** Successful leaders often possess an "even temperament," avoiding extreme highs or lows [11:26]. This involves not "catastrophiz[ing] when things go badly" or "go[ing] bananas when everything's going well" [11:33].
*   **Curiosity** A desire to "keep learning new things" is essential, as one never stops learning [11:45].
*   **Communication Skills** These are deemed "critical" in the [[leadership_and_politics | political sphere]] [11:53].
*   **Conflict Management and Emotional Intelligence (EQ)** In [[leadership_and_politics | politics]], which is fundamentally a "people business," managing egos and personalities requires high levels of EQ [11:55]. These skills are vital for building effective teams [12:07].
*   **Commercial and Economic Orientation** Having a business and commercial background can be helpful, especially during economically challenging times [12:25].
*   **Team Building** Chris views his role as a "captain" of a sports team, focusing on getting "the right people in the right places on the right assignments with great clarity about what we're trying to achieve and what success looks like" [13:58].

## Differences and Adaptations
One significant difference is the public's expectations. While shareholders focus on dividends, citizens expect substantive improvements in their lives, public services, economic growth, and safety [19:05]. This demands a focus on [[challenges_and_responsibilities_in_political_leadership | delivering for people]] rather than just financial returns [31:30].

When moving from business to politics, Chris advises being "prepared to unlearn things that may have made you successful in one job and one career" [29:05]. [[leadership_and_politics | Politics]] involves navigating "very layered, very nuanced, very... complex" policy areas that cannot be approached simplistically [29:20]. However, the business discipline of "how to attack a problem and how to define a problem, put a common sense solution to it" is an advantage [29:31]. He notes that governments often struggle with problem definition, leading to ineffective solutions [29:40].

## Leadership Philosophy
Chris emphasizes that identity should not be tied to job titles, as titles "will come and go" [04:37]. He prioritizes personal relationships—first as a husband, then a father, then a brother, and then a son—over his role as Prime Minister [04:12]. This perspective stems from the belief that "it's not what you do, it's actually who you are that matters much more" [04:32]. Ultimately, life is about "who you are and the relationships that you have" [06:32].

## Navigating [[public_perception_of_politics | Public Perception]] and Criticism
Dealing with constant public opinion, especially on social media, can be overwhelming [13:01]. Chris manages this by being "fully informed about social media" but "not consumed by it" [12:54]. He chooses which advice to take, focusing on his trusted circle of friends, mentors, and family for grounding [13:18]. His approach is to stay connected to his "mission and purpose" [14:58]. He believes that "not all opinions are equal" and that one has the agency to choose how to respond to external stimuli [15:31]. Time is best invested in "real human to human connections and relationships" rather than being engrossed in online commentary [15:56].

## The Role of Money in [[politics_and_entrepreneurship | Politics]]
Chris states that New Zealand has "very tight laws around campaign financing" to prevent money from buying influence [17:09]. This system, which limits spending per candidate, aims to ensure that "money isn't the reason for which someone can't run as a parliamentarian" [18:34]. This fosters diversity in Parliament, allowing people from all walks of life, including artists, police officers, and teachers, to participate [18:40].

## Advice for Aspiring Politicians
For entrepreneurs considering a career in [[political_aspirations_and_involvement | politics]], Chris advises being prepared to "unlearn some stuff and... learn some new things" [29:14]. This includes mastering complex policy areas, understanding parliamentary procedures, and staying connected to one's party and constituents [30:04]. He encourages those frustrated with the system not to "disengage from it" but to "get into the arena" and "be the change" they wish to see [40:01].

## Outlook on Global Challenges
Chris identifies several macro trends shifting the world order:
*   A shift "from rules to power" [34:50].
*   A shift "from economics to security" [34:52].
*   A shift "from efficiency to resilience" in global supply chains, influenced by disruptions like the COVID-19 pandemic and conflicts [34:59].

He believes the traditional labels of "socialism, capitalism, left, right" are unhelpful [37:20]. Instead, governments should be "customer-centric" and focused on "delivering for your people and their needs," such as addressing the cost of living, restoring law and order, and improving health and education outcomes [37:28]. He champions leveraging technology and adopting a "customer mentality" within public service to ensure government delivers effectively for its citizens [28:30].

## Optimism for the Future
Despite global challenges, Chris feels "very optimistic about the future in the world" [39:29]. He observes that the next generation is "incredibly altruistic" and approaches issues with less "baggage and prejudice of historical prejudice" [39:09]. He sees them as willing to collaborate and work together, which gives him confidence in their future [[politics_and_global_leaders | leadership]] [39:21]. Chris's message to [[youth_involvement_in_politics | young people]] is to get involved and actively shape the system rather than disengaging [39:55].

## Core Principles

Building [[longevity | brand longevity]] requires a different approach than short-term growth strategies. While tactics like growth hacking and performance marketing on Amazon are considered core skills for immediate results, questions arise about their contribution to a brand's long-term existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

A brand is compared to building a spaceship, implying a complex, long-term, and engineering-like endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

Consumption is noted as being dramatically greater in some areas, such as gated communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

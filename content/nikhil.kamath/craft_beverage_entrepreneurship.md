## Journeys of Craft Beverage Entrepreneurs

### Matt Chakkoran – Blue Tokai Coffee Roasters
Matt's journey into coffee began in San Francisco, where specialty coffee was taking off, leading him to understand coffee as more than a functional beverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:48">[02:48:48]</a>. He started roasting coffee as a hobby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:01">[02:58:01]</a>. In 2012, after identifying a "desperate" coffee situation in Delhi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:02">[04:54:02]</a>, he and his wife started a coffee company, initially for self-consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:25">[05:22:25]</a>. They convinced producers to sell them export-quality coffee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:07">[05:06:07]</a>, launching from a small bedroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:04">[05:10:04]</a> with a 500-gram tabletop roaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:09">[05:50:09]</a>. Blue Tokai has grown to a 400 crore run rate with 135 outlets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

### Aditya Mehra – Mosan Kombucha
Aditya's background is in culinary arts, having studied in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:07">[09:10:07]</a> and previously owned a coffee shop in Bangalore that became one of the top five cafes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:24:00">[13:24:00]</a>. He got into kombucha when his partner, Shush, started making it for health reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">[14:17:00]</a>. They started Mosan in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:51:00">[17:51:00]</a> with the intention of making a "better soda" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:04:00">[16:04:00]</a>, focusing on showcasing Indian teas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:20:00">[18:20:00]</a>. A key challenge was the alcohol regulation, limiting products to below 0.5% ABV to be considered an FMCG product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:05:00">[19:05:00]</a>. Mosan started with an investment of only six lakhs (about $7,000 USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:05">[01:49:05]</a>.

### Anish Madan – Swamy
Anish, with a background in photography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>, was introduced to wine and alcohol through his assignments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>, which later led him to coffee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:53">[00:26:53]</a>. Swami started as a mixer company, identifying a white space in the market beyond international brands like Schweppes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:53">[02:00:53]</a>. Their initial focus was on improving the gin and tonic experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. Swami emphasizes its Indian provenance, with names like "tonic water from India" on its labels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:18">[02:28:18]</a>. They project to reach 30-35 crore (approximately $3.6-4.2 million USD) next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:51">[02:56:51]</a>.

### Rahul Reddy – Subko Coffee Roasters & Bakehouse
Rahul, born in California and with a family history from Hyderabad, moved to India with a vision to create something world-class rooted deeply in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>. He observed that India, despite being a significant coffee producer (5th to 7th largest globally) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:23">[00:41:23]</a>, primarily exported its coffee. Subko aims to foster domestic consumption and build Indian coffee as a cultural symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>. Subko differentiates itself through its deep commitment to design language and the co-creation of baked goods with coffee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:18">[00:46:18]</a>.

## Key Insights and Strategies for [[creative_entrepreneurship | Creative Entrepreneurship]] in Craft Beverages

### Market Dynamics & Differentiation
*   **Mass vs. Niche Premium:** Brands like Blue Tokai are seen as more "mass premium" while Subko is "niche premium" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:33">[00:43:33]</a>.
*   **Product Offering:** Expanding the menu beyond just coffee can significantly increase sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:31">[00:50:31]</a>. Coffee shops often derive 50% of their revenue from food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>.
*   **Subculture and Experience:** As the coffee culture matures, differentiation beyond just quality becomes crucial. This can involve creating a space for subcultural activities like vinyl records or unique event concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:14">[00:54:14]</a>.
*   **Health as a Driver:** There's a growing trend towards health-focused consumption. While some coffee beverages are sugar-heavy, there's a rising segment of consumers looking for black coffee or healthier alternatives like kombucha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. The idea of "healthier" rather than "healthy" is gaining traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:49">[02:07:49]</a>. This aligns with a broader trend in consumption where anything related to [[entrepreneurship_and_wellness | health and wellness]] is gaining traction, even amidst an economic slowdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:57">[01:30:57]</a>.
*   **Indian Identity:** Emphasizing Indian provenance and creating local flavors (e.g., *kokum* cold brew, *kasara* kombucha) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:14">[02:11:14]</a> can resonate with consumers, especially as Indian consumers show increasing affinity for homegrown brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:13">[02:21:13]</a>.

### Challenges and Considerations
*   **Capital Investment:** Starting a coffee shop requires significant capital (e.g., 80 lakhs to 1.5 crore for a 1,000 sq ft prime location) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:13">[02:49:13]</a>. Roastery operations are also capital-intensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:22">[00:59:22]</a>.
*   **Real Estate:** High real estate costs and limited supply in India are major hurdles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:12">[01:17:12]</a>. A mix of office and residential areas is ideal for a coffee shop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:51">[02:54:51]</a>.
*   **Taxation:** India imposes a 40% tax on carbonated and sugary beverages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:05">[02:00:05]</a>, which significantly impacts pricing and stifles innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:11">[02:04:11]</a>. This makes it difficult to compete with mass-market products like Sting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:10">[02:17:10]</a>. This issue is a major [[challenges_of_scaling_beverage_businesses_in_India | challenge for scaling beverage businesses in India]].
*   **[[challenges_in_beverage_distribution | Distribution and Manufacturing]]:** Securing bottling and canning services can be difficult, especially for smaller brands, due to large players acquiring bottlers and political connections in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:46">[02:12:46]</a>.
*   **Staffing:** Barista pay scales are rapidly increasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:10">[02:53:10]</a> as they are seen as expert mixologists, impacting operating costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:14">[02:53:14]</a>.
*   **Consumer Behavior:** Indian consumers often occupy cafe space for longer periods compared to Western markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:06">[02:06:06]</a>. They also tend to be highly price-conscious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:53">[02:35:53]</a>.

### Marketing and Branding
*   **Organic Growth vs. Performance Marketing:** Some brands, like Subko, advocate for zero spending on performance marketing, relying instead on strong branding, design, and organic content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:43">[03:06:43]</a>. Others use micro-influencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:11">[03:05:11]</a>.
*   **Storytelling:** Authentic storytelling, especially from the founders or team members, can be more impactful than generic advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:02">[03:09:02]</a>.
*   **Collaborations:** Partnering with other brands, artists, or musicians can generate attention and reach new audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:04">[03:14:04]</a>.
*   **Offline Presence:** For craft beverages, a physical presence in cafes, restaurants, and hotels is crucial for discovery and brand building, particularly for new entrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:51">[02:37:51]</a>.
*   **"India's First" is Not Enough:** Simply being the "first" of something in India doesn't guarantee success; genuine quality and resonance are key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:03">[02:47:03]</a>.

### The [[NonAlcoholic Drink Industry | Non-alcoholic Beverage Industry]]
*   **Beyond Mixers:** The non-alcoholic beverage category offers vast potential beyond just mixers, including functional beverages focusing on gut health, hydration, nutrition (e.g., protein, collagen) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:48">[02:08:48]</a>.
*   **Accessibility:** Making products more accessible and cheaper is crucial for mass adoption in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:29">[01:59:29]</a>. A temporary price drop from 130 to 99 rupees for kombucha led to a 6x increase in business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>, indicating the importance of price point.
*   **Taste Adaptation:** Products might need to adapt to local tastes; for example, North Indian markets often prefer sweeter products than their Western counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:07">[02:43:07]</a>.

## Advice for Aspiring Entrepreneurs
*   **Understand Regulations:** Thoroughly understand taxation (e.g., 40% on carbonated, sugary drinks) and alcohol regulations (e.g., below 0.5% ABV for kombucha) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:03">[02:06:03]</a>.
*   **Define Your "Voice":** Identify the problem your product is solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:22">[02:06:22]</a>. For kombucha, this might be offering a "better Coke" alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:30">[02:06:30]</a>.
*   **Start Small, Learn, and Adapt:** Begin with smaller investments and learn through experience before scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:03">[03:00:03]</a>. Mosan started with minimal capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:05">[01:49:05]</a>.
*   **Focus on Core Quality and Consistency:** While differentiation is key, fundamental product quality and consistency in food and beverage offerings are paramount for repeat business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>.
*   **Build Your Brand Independently:** Do not solely rely on quick commerce platforms for brand building, as they may eventually introduce private labels or squeeze smaller brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:54">[02:32:54]</a>.
*   **Networking and Community:** The [[craft_beverages_industry_insights | craft beverage space in India]] is a small community where players often help each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:41">[02:43:41]</a>.

## Defining Craft
[[Defining craft in the beverage industry | Craft]] in the beverage industry can be defined by three words: authenticity, innovation, and quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:36">[01:58:36]</a>. The more these elements are present, the better. This pursuit of quality and unique identity is what drives many entrepreneurs in this space.

The Live Love Laugh Foundation (TLLLF), an organization dedicated to mental health, was formally launched in Mumbai in October 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. Led by Anisha Padukone, TLLLF's core mission is to provide hope to individuals experiencing stress, anxiety, and depression, especially when they feel there is none <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. The foundation was started with the belief that no life should be lost due to mental illness, given India's high suicide rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.

## Founding and Vision

The foundation's genesis stems from founder Deepika Padukone's personal experience with anxiety and depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. This journey highlighted a severe lack of awareness and significant stigma surrounding mental health in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. To systematically and sustainably address these issues, she founded TLLLF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>. Padukone first publicly committed to mental health with tweets in December 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>, followed by her first national television interview sharing her story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>, which was considered a watershed moment for mental health in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

## Strategic Approach: The Three A's

TLLLF focuses its efforts on three key areas: Awareness, Accessibility, and Affordability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. All of the foundation's programs and initiatives are designed to fall under these three buckets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. The approach to tailoring programs depends on the target audience and the appropriate medium to reach them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>. For urban dwellers who are consumers of [[the_impact_of_social_media_and_influencer_culture | social media]], digital platforms are the preferred method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. However, for a 45-year-old man in rural India, social media is not effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>, emphasizing the need to understand the target audience and available resources to tailor interventions accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.

## Reaching Diverse Audiences and Rural Challenges

A significant challenge for TLLLF is reaching diverse populations across India, particularly in rural areas where understanding mental illness is difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>. In these regions, there's a prevalent belief in faith healers and black magic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>. Instances of mental illness often manifest as aggressive behavior, leading to individuals being chained to beds or trees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>. To address this, TLLLF implements a community-based model for its [[impact_of_donation_on_rural_education_projects | rural program]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>, focusing on supporting, raising awareness, and empowering the larger community rather than individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>.

Key milestones in their journey include:
*   **First School Program:** Held at The Thea School in Bangalore, this program created awareness on mental health for adolescent students and teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.
*   **First Rural Visit:** Deepika Padukone and the trustees visited Davangere in October 2017 to commemorate World Mental Health Day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.

## Achievements and Impact

After eight years of operation, TLLLF identifies its biggest achievements not as awards, but as the visible transformation in individuals' lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>. Team members are frequently approached by unknown people who share how TLLLF helped them through extremely difficult situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>. Similar transformational stories emerge from their [[impact_of_donation_on_rural_education_projects | rural program]] beneficiaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>. These personal stories of change are considered the true measures of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>.

### Recent Funding and Future Scale
The foundation recently secured an amount of 75 lakh rupees, which is pivotal for their vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>. This year, TLLLF has decided to scale its [[impact_of_donation_on_rural_education_projects | rural mental health program]], which has been running since 2016 and has a well-established model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>. The funds will be primarily used to expand this rural program in various ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>. This infusion of capital will help TLLLF to further [[impact_of_leadership_innovation_and_philanthropy_in_business_growth | grow and scale]] its critical work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.

Personal relationships and family dynamics play a crucial role in shaping an individual's life, influencing their [[childhood_and_family_influences | upbringing]], career choices, emotional development, and [[personal_and_professional_growth_experiences_and_reflections | personal growth]]. The experiences within the family unit, from childhood interactions to adult relationships, can leave a lasting impact on one's identity and approach to life.

## [[childhood_and_family_influences | Childhood and Family Influences]]

Growing up, the foundation of an individual's personality and values is often laid within the family. Born to actors Rishi Kapoor and Neetu Singh, Ranbir Kapoor notes he is a fourth-generation actor in his family and grew up in a privileged household <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. Despite this, he mentions being an introvert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

In school, he wasn't treated specially and was disciplined by teachers and the principal, sometimes being picked on more as the "celebrity kid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. He realized early that acting didn't require strong academic performance, which he used to his advantage, as he was "below average in everything" except football <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

His father, concerned about the early media attention, sent him back to America for further education, emphasizing the need to "do something useful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:53">[01:06:53]</a>. His father also kept him on a tight budget while in New York, wanting him to "live like a student" and "see what hardship is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. This strictness extended to taking away his car and not giving him pocket money when he started as an assistant director <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. He acknowledges that parents' actions, even if seemingly for the child, might also be to satisfy themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

### Parental Relationships and Emotional Development

Ranbir's relationship with his father was characterized by distance and fear rather than closeness. He recalls being "so scared" of his father, never saying no, and not understanding his father's point of view due to his inexpressive nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. He never saw his father's eye color, always looking down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. His father's "volatile" temperament led to him developing a sensitivity to loud tones from childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. He reflects that his father's generation of men might have been "scared of vulnerability" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>, making it difficult for them to express love physically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.

Despite the distance, he acknowledges his father's deep love and care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. The family's frequent fights, which he often overheard, instilled a sense of fear and being "always on the edge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. He eventually understood that both his parents "found beautiful companionship" later in life, especially during his father's cancer treatment, witnessing his mother's "selfless service" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.

His father's passing revealed deeper emotional complexities. He didn't cry and experienced a panic attack, realizing he didn't know how to express himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:46">[00:33:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:59">[00:33:59]</a>. He feels guilt for not having "the grace to let go of the distance" and hug his father during his illness, especially when his father cried in front of him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:33">[00:34:33]</a>. He attributed his inability to cry to a learned behavior from childhood, where he "stopped crying very early on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:37">[00:33:37]</a>, and a societal expectation not to show weakness as a man and family head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>.

In contrast, his relationship with his mother is "great" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>. His mother is his "biggest fan" and always supports his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:15">[01:12:15]</a>. He notes that his own personality is "more like his mother's," being calm and happy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:45">[01:26:45]</a>. His mother and wife Alia have a very honest and good relationship, which makes him happy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:20">[01:01:20]</a>.

### Sibling and Extended Family Dynamics

Ranbir's relationship with his sister, two years his elder, involved childhood sibling rivalry and fighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. However, due to their respective studies abroad and her marriage, they "missed out on the good years of bonding" and are "not as close to her as I would like to be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>. This distance contributes to his self-perceived "avoidant attached" nature, which he believes started at a very young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.

## [[personal_relationships_and_identity | Impact of Marriage and Fatherhood]]

Marriage and fatherhood have been significant game-changers in Ranbir's life, challenging his long-held sense of detachment and indifference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a>.

### Marriage with Alia Bhatt

Ranbir married Alia Bhatt, who is 11 years younger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:28">[00:56:28]</a>. He first met her when she was 9 and he was 20, during a photo shoot for a film that was never made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:32">[00:56:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:36">[00:56:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:40">[00:56:40]</a>. Their romance began on a flight in 2018 while working on the film *Brahmastra* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:16">[00:59:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:23">[00:59:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:28">[00:59:28]</a>. They started living together from the first year of dating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:12">[00:59:12]</a>.

He describes Alia as a "wonderful person," "very colorful," "ambitious girl," and an "overachiever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:22">[00:56:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:32">[00:57:32]</a>. He has immense respect for her as an actor, artist, person, daughter, and sister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:10">[00:57:10]</a>. He values her as his "best friend" with whom he can "chat, laugh" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>. He loves going on holidays with her and coming home to her, stating she makes him "very happy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:23">[00:57:23]</a>.

Alia has made efforts to adapt to their relationship, such as lowering her loud tone, which had previously "rattled" him due to his father's influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:11">[00:58:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:15">[00:58:15]</a>. He acknowledges that she "changed more for me than I have changed for her" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:04">[00:58:04]</a>.

The lockdown period during COVID-19 further "solidified" their relationship, as they spent the entire time together, engaging in healthy activities like training, playing games, and learning poker, without frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:46">[00:59:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:14">[01:00:14]</a>. Alia was also very supportive during his father's illness, staying with him in the hospital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:18">[01:00:18]</a>. He believes that a partner's relationship with one's family is a "game changer," as an outsider loving your family like you do is very rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:34">[01:00:34]</a>.

### Fatherhood and Emotional Shift

The birth of his daughter, Raha, has been a "game changer" and a "top high" in his life, making him "question Detachment and indifference" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34]">[00:32:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:37">[01:16:37]</a>. He describes the feeling of holding her as "somebody's kind of taking a your heart out and just put it in your hand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>. He feels "reborn," with new emotions and feelings "creeping in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:52">[02:00:52]</a>. His previous indifference to death has changed; he no longer feels 71 is a sufficient lifespan but wishes for "at least for 40 more years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>. He also got his daughter's name tattooed on his body, signifying his deep affection for her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:03">[01:24:03]</a>.

He noted that Raha views Alia as an extension of herself, while with him, she seeks "musty and fun and and the laughter and and and flirting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:34">[01:17:34]</a>.

## Broader Relationships and [[personal_and_professional_growth_experiences_and_reflections | Personal Growth]]

### Friends and Mentors

Ranbir values his close friends, Ayan and Rohit Dhawan. Ayan serves as a "moral compass" with whom he shares ideologies and cinematic philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:18">[01:27:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:30">[01:27:30]</a>. Rohit is someone he calls for "mindless conversations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:13">[01:27:13]</a>. He also acknowledges that his perspective on mentors has evolved, realizing that those he admired from afar have their own flaws and weaknesses upon closer interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:34">[01:28:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:41">[01:28:41]</a>.

### Outlook on Relationships

Ranbir believes in monogamy, stating that "one woman forever" is the "only healthy way of living" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:18">[00:55:18]</a>. He recognizes that marriage requires individuals to "let go of your personality" and adjust to each other, necessitating sacrifice of "facets of him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:36">[01:25:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:49">[01:25:49]</a>. He states he doesn't want to hurt his wife Alia or his daughter Raha, vowing not to do anything that would make them "question" him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:38">[00:55:38]</a>.

His journey demonstrates how family dynamics, both positive and challenging, contribute significantly to an individual's emotional landscape and life choices. The evolution of his [[personal_relationships_and_identity | personal relationships]] reveals a shift from emotional distance to profound connection, particularly through fatherhood.

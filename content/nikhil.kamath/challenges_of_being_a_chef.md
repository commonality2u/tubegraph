## Societal Perceptions and Gender Norms
Historically, becoming a chef was considered "unheard of" for a girl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## High-Stress Environment
Working as a chef in a busy kitchen is identified as one of the [[stressful_jobs_in_the_culinary_industry | most stressful jobs in the world]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This profession is grouped with stockbrokers and soldiers due to its inherent pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Regulatory Hurdles
The process of establishing a food business, which is often a career path for chefs, involves significant [[challenges_and_success_stories_of_opening_a_restaurant | regulatory obstacles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. For instance, selling a sandwich can require as many as 36 licenses and no-objection certificates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. In comparison, opening an arms factory reportedly only requires 14 licenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This highlights the extensive bureaucratic requirements faced by those in the culinary industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

In regions without consistent access to electricity or mobile network signals, innovative solutions emerged to facilitate communication and power access. Observations from these environments directly influenced the development of consumer electronics designed for such challenging conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Power Solutions

In villages lacking electricity, businesses found ways to operate essential services. For instance, an AEL ISDPCO booth utilized a large truck battery as its primary power source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. To charge this battery, the booth operator would travel 11 kilometers to a village with electricity, charge the battery overnight, and return in the morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This entrepreneurial approach, despite the logistical challenges, allowed the operator to earn approximately 4,000 rupees a month, a significant income in a village without basic amenities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

Further observations in rural Bihar revealed that people would pay 25 to 40 rupees to charge their mobile phones, underscoring the demand for reliable phone power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Signal Solutions

Addressing the lack of mobile signal, the same booth employed a large 20 dB gain antenna mounted on a pole on its terrace to draw signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This improvised setup allowed them to provide services where standard phone reception was non-existent.

## Impact on Product Design

These experiences highlighted a critical market need for mobile phones with extended [[battery_technology_and_management|battery]] life. This insight directly led to the creation of the first Micromax phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. The phone was designed with a remarkable 1-month [[long_battery_life_as_a_differentiator|battery]] backup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Its tagline, "mobile kebab," reflected its exceptional standby time of 30 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

The phone's [[long_battery_life_as_a_differentiator|battery]] was its key differentiator in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. It sold out within 10 days due to this unique feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

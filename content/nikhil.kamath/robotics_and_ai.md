Discussions around robotics and [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_future_impact_on_society | AI]] often delve into hypothetical scenarios and their potential impact on human interaction and society.

## Hypothetical Interactions with Robots

One speculative scenario describes a situation where a robot might have a leg torn off and used to hit someone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. In response, a human with a "chip in my brain" suggests they would adapt and "figure out something else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This leads to a question about the [[Applications and Future of AI | future possibility]] of plugging human brains into machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

Another hypothetical considers a situation "if Apple was a robot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, implying a future where established companies might manifest as robotic entities.

## The Impact of AI

The conversation also touches on the capabilities of advanced AI, with a mention that "GBD4" (likely referring to GPT-4) is considered capable enough to eliminate "White Collar jobs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This highlights concerns about the [[Impact of AI on future workforce and society | impact of AI]] on employment.

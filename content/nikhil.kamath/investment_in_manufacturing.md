Discussions regarding investment in India touch upon the patterns of major Indian entities, such as the Tatas and "the builders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. A rhetorical question was posed about when these groups last invested money "beyond manufacturing" in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This implies that manufacturing has historically been a significant area of investment for such groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

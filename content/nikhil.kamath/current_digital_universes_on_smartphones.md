While the term "metaverse" often evokes images of three-dimensional, [[virtual_reality_and_augmented_reality | virtual reality]] and [[virtual_reality_and_augmented_reality | augmented reality]] environments accessed via [[devices_and_technology_in_the_metaverse | devices and technology]] like Oculus headsets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>, it is argued that people already inhabit digital universes through their smartphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## The "Metaversal Habit"

The behavior associated with engaging in digital worlds, termed the "metaversal habit," is already prevalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Individuals spend significant time on their phones, with some reporting screen times of 10 hours a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This constant engagement means people are "logging off reality" and interacting with their devices, a behavior considered a "metaversal experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Current Digital Universes

Each application on a smartphone can be considered its own universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. These universes are tailored to individual tastes and interests:
*   **Lifestyle Universe** Users enter a lifestyle universe by opening Instagram to see what people are eating or where they are going <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Thoughts and Opinions Universe** Platforms like Koo or Twitter serve as a universe for thoughts and opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

Currently, these experiences are primarily two-dimensional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. While the overall experience on the phone can be "great," the two-dimensional nature is sometimes described as "sad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Immersive Experiences and [[Tech Innovations and Future Trends | Technological Advancements]]

The concept of the metaverse suggests that the more immersive a digital experience becomes, the more "meta" it gets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The general behavior of users indicates a readiness for more immersive [[technology and virtual reality | technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

### The Future of Phone-Based Universes
A potential future for the metaverse could involve phones, browsers, or applications providing a three-dimensional feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. This contrasts with more specialized [[devices_and_technology_in_the_metaverse | devices and technology]] like Oculus, which are currently seen as bulky, expensive (costing $400-$500 for the new version), and suited for very few "elite experiences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. The idea is to extend the current phone-based universes into more immersive, potentially three-dimensional, environments without requiring dedicated, high-cost hardware.

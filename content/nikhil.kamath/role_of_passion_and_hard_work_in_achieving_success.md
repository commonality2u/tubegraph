### The Path to Success in Unconventional Careers

The three guests have all forged successful careers in fields widely considered unconventional and highly aspirational: acting, cricket, and music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. A central theme of the discussion is to uncover the [[success_factors_for_entrepreneurs | nuances]] of their paths that led to their current positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

#### Kriti Sanon: From Shy Student to Confident Actor

Kriti Sanon describes herself as a shy, studious, and nerdy firstborn child who felt the pressure to excel academically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Despite having stage fright, she enjoyed dancing, a talent her mother recognized early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Her mother, a professor who fought for her own dreams, was very competitive and pushed Kriti to do well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:58">[01:10:58]</a>. This parental influence meant that Kriti's achievements were seen as compliments to her mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:55">[00:45:55]</a>.

Kriti's journey highlights the [[influence_of_talent_vs_passion_in_career_success | interplay of talent and passion]]. She initially pursued engineering without a clear career goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:02">[01:13:02]</a>, but later discovered her passion for acting through modeling and commercials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:56">[01:53:56]</a>. She emphasizes that one must love what they do, or be good at something and find their passion through it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:19">[01:53:19]</a>.

Key aspects of her success:
*   **Perseverance and Confidence:** Despite initial setbacks like crying after her first ramp show and photoshoot due to self-consciousness, she gained confidence by repeatedly putting herself in situations she feared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:47">[00:41:47]</a>. She learned to embrace challenges that both excite and scare her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:58">[00:42:58]</a>.
*   **Continuous Learning:** Kriti identifies as a "learner" who constantly asks questions to evolve and grow, even when it was initially perceived negatively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:44">[00:49:44]</a>. She believes in asking questions without the insecurity of looking stupid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:52">[00:51:52]</a>.
*   **Adaptability:** She acknowledges the importance of evolving and molding oneself to suit different roles as one ages in the industry, rather than clinging to past types of characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:06">[02:20:06]</a>.

Kriti values peace and a sense of calm, despite living in a competitive profession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:23">[02:21:23]</a>. She describes her current state as "happy restless," where she is content with her achievements but still seeks new challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:23">[02:21:23]</a>. She also notes that financial security was not a primary driver for her career choices, as her parents provided for her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:29">[02:25:29]</a>.

#### Rahul: Innate Talent and Grounded Approach in Cricket

Rahul grew up in a small town, Mangalore, and was obsessed with cricket from the age of two and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:16">[00:58:16]</a>. He played multiple sports, which he believes helped him develop overall athletic ability, making him better at cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:32">[00:59:32]</a>. His parents, both professors, were supportive but strict about maintaining good grades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:56">[01:14:56]</a>.

Rahul strongly believes in innate talent in sports, stating that certain abilities like hand-eye coordination cannot be fully acquired and are essential for reaching higher levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:15">[01:03:15]</a>. He emphasizes:
*   **Passion as a Driver:** His "love for cricket" started very young <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>, providing him immense joy and happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Over-ambition:** Rahul has learned from past experiences that looking too far ahead or being desperate to overachieve can lead to significant setbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:38">[01:23:38]</a>. He finds it necessary to remind himself to appreciate his current position and remain grounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:12">[01:21:12]</a>. This approach helps him perform better, as he's not burdened by outcome-related anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:41">[01:24:41]</a>.
*   **Resilience to Trolling:** Rahul initially didn't care about trolling but was significantly scarred by public backlash and suspension earlier in his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:42">[01:27:42]</a>. He now deals with it by limiting social media engagement and seeking comfort in his personal "safe space" with his wife, who keeps him grounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:33">[01:31:33]</a>.
*   **Self-reliance:** Rahul believes that the "ability to be your own team" and fight battles alone, without leaning on others, helps one go further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:55">[01:34:55]</a>.
*   **Planning for the Future:** Recognizing the finite shelf life of an athlete, Rahul has started investing and exploring business ventures to ensure a smooth transition after retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:27">[02:18:27]</a>.

#### Badshah: The Power of Originality and Patience in Music

Aditya, known as Badshah, also comes from a background of academic pressure, with a government-job father and teacher mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:24">[01:44:24]</a>. He pursued engineering (civil), and even worked as a subdivisional officer after college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:42">[02:08:42]</a>. His journey into music began with a love for writing and rhyming, evolving from listening to Punjabi and Bollywood music to discovering rap in school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:59">[02:01:59]</a>.

Badshah's [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_challenges | entrepreneurial journey]] in music:
*   **Passion and Purpose:** He firmly states that aspiring musicians should only enter the industry if they are truly passionate about music, not just for money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:14">[02:13:14]</a>.

*   **Patience and Persistence:** Echoing Jay-Z, Badshah believes the "only genius thing" is not giving up, and that if one is truly passionate, success is "only a matter of time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:41">[02:13:41]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of patience, especially as one becomes successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:30">[02:36:30]</a>.
*   **Outworking Competition:** He highlights the "fight" within oneself to "outwork someone else who your competition is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:05">[02:37:05]</a>.
*   **Embracing Change and Adaptation:** Badshah believes in continually evolving and keeping up with changing times, including embracing new technologies like AI in music production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:46">[02:22:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:01">[02:05:01]</a>.

#### General Advice for Success

The conversation offers broader advice on [[motivation_to_work | motivation to work]] and [[character_traits_of_successful_entrepreneurs | success factors]]:
*   **Avoiding "Cool" Industries for Profit:** The general consensus is that if the primary outcome is money, one should avoid industries "where too many passionate people are competing over passion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:35">[01:48:35]</a>. Instead, focus on "boring" businesses where the likelihood of making money is higher, like energy transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:10">[01:52:10]</a>.
*   **Sector First, Then Product:** Aspiring entrepreneurs should spend significant time researching which sector will be significantly larger in the future to benefit from "Tailwinds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:08">[02:38:08]</a>.
*   **Fail Fast:** If a business or project isn't gaining "significant traction" within the first couple of years, it's advisable to "ditch it fast" and reconsider, as time is a finite resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:50">[02:39:50]</a>.
*   **The "Dog" in You:** A key, non-obvious element of success is having "a little bit of a dog in you," implying a competitive drive to outwork others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:54">[02:36:54]</a>.
*   **Impact of Relationships:** While Badshah prioritizes focus and finds relationships distracting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:41">[02:30:41]</a>, Rahul emphasizes the stability and grounding a partner provides, which helps him stay focused in his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:06">[02:32:06]</a>. This highlights the varied personal needs for stability and support. The nature of [[passion_versus_addiction_in_fitness | relationships]] and societal constructs are also touched upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:57">[02:33:57]</a>.
*   **Dealing with [[professional_challenges_and_setbacks | Professional Challenges]]:** The discussion also delves into the emotional toll of [[professional_challenges_and_setbacks | setbacks]] and public scrutiny, highlighting the importance of coping mechanisms and a strong support system.

Chris Hipkins, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, has a unique background as a former business leader at Unilever and Air New Zealand before entering [[political_aspirations_and_involvement | political life]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. This transition is seen by some as a growing trend globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

## Motivation for the Transition

Hipkins describes the privilege of leading a country as "very, very special" and "incredibly challenging but... very, very rewarding" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. His primary motivation is public service, aiming to improve the livelihoods of citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. As a non-career politician, he offers an "outside in perspective" on what needs to change and how the country can improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. He believes that having a prior career in business helps one understand the world and how to help people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

## Transferable Skills from Business to Politics

Hipkins highlights several [[leadership_skills_and_their_application_in_politics | skills]] and principles from his business career that are highly applicable to his role as Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>:

*   **Protecting and Enhancing Good Elements** The principle of preserving and improving existing good things in a country or company remains the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
*   **Stimulating Change** The ability to provoke and stimulate necessary change is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   **Finding Balance** A leader's task is to balance protecting existing positives with stimulating change; neither constant upheaval nor pure incrementalism works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
*   **Curiosity and Learning** Staying curious and continuously learning new things is essential for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
*   **Character and Temperament** Maintaining an even temperament and not catastrophizing during challenges or becoming overly celebratory during successes is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.
*   **Communication Skills** These are deemed critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.
*   **Conflict Management and Emotional Intelligence (EQ)** In [[leadership_and_politics | politics]], which is a "people business," managing egos, personalities, and building good teams requires high EQ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.
*   **Commercial and Economic Orientation** A strong understanding of economics and commercial principles is beneficial, especially during economic challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.
*   **Team Building** Much like a sports team, Hipkins emphasizes placing the right people in the right roles with clear objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.
*   **Problem Definition** He notes that governments often struggle with defining problems, a skill that can be brought from business to formulate common-sense solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>.
*   **Customer Centricity** Applying a customer mentality to public service, focusing on delivering for citizens' needs, is key to efficient government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>.

## Challenges and What Needs to Be Unlearned

The transition from business to politics is not seamless, and Hipkins acknowledges that running a company is "completely different" from running a country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. He compares it to switching from playing cricket to playing hockey, requiring a willingness to "start from the beginning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

> "I was really, you know, I'd gone from playing cricket to now playing hockey, you know, like it's actually you had to start from the beginning and not come in assumptive that just because you've been successful in one sphere of life that you immediately going to be successful in another sphere." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>

A critical aspect is being prepared to **unlearn** what made one successful in a previous career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>. Political policy areas are often layered, nuanced, and complex, not to be approached simplistically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>. Politicians must master policy areas and understand how parliament works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>.

Hipkins advises that not all successful business people make great politicians, and vice-versa. The key lies in the individual's ability to transition, focusing on the principles of [[leadership_and_politics | leadership]] and building effective organizations, regardless of their prior field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>.

## [[Role of money and campaign financing in politics | Role of Money in Politics]]

Hipkins addresses the perceived notion that money is a precondition for success in politics, especially concerning the path for business people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>. He clarifies that in New Zealand, strict laws govern campaign financing, limiting individual spending significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.

> "I mean we come from a political system in New Zealand where money you know we have very tight laws around campaign financing and so we don't have the challenges that I observe in other countries around the world or other democracies where money buys influence." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>

This system ensures that money is not a barrier to running for office, fostering greater diversity in parliament, including artists, police officers, teachers, and business people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>.

## Dealing with Stakeholders: Shareholders vs. Voters

When asked who is harder to deal with, shareholders or voters, Hipkins states "without doubt the public" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. He explains that voters expect leaders to deliver on substantive issues that directly impact their lives, such as improving public services, growing the economy, and maintaining law and order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. These expectations lead to "huge expectations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.

## Advice for Aspiring Politicians from the Business World

For entrepreneurs considering a transition into politics, Hipkins offers the following advice:

*   **Be Prepared to Unlearn:** Success in business does not automatically translate. Be open to letting go of old methods and acquiring new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>.
*   **Start from the Bottom:** Approach the new field with humility, recognizing it's a completely different game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>.
*   **Master Policy Areas:** Dive deep into the complex, layered, and nuanced policy issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>.
*   **Engage with the System:** For those frustrated with the system, Hipkins encourages active participation rather than disengagement.

> "Get involved, you know, change the system. If you don't like the system, get into the system and actually make it a better system. You know, that's what I've tried to do. You can sit on the sidelines and you can comment and get behind your keyboard and sound off, but otherwise get into the arena and actually give it a go and actually shape it and make it change and be the change that, you know, famously said, you want to see." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:55">[00:39:55]</a>

Ultimately, Hipkins stresses that the qualities of great leadership and building effective organizations are universal, applicable across [[politics_and_entrepreneurship | business]], politics, and non-profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>. The focus should be on finding individuals with emotional intelligence, skills, and experience to do the job properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:46">[00:33:46]</a>.

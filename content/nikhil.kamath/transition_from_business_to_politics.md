Chris, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, made a notable [[transition_from_childhood_to_career_in_a_business_family | transition from a career in business]] to one in [[politics_and_entrepreneurship | politics]]. His background includes working at Unilever and Air New Zealand before entering public service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:11">[07:08:11]</a>.

## Reasons for the Transition
Chris views his move into [[politics_and_entrepreneurship | political life]] as "tremendously worth it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>. His primary motivation is deeply rooted in public service, aiming to improve the livelihoods of citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>. He emphasizes that he is "not a career politician," which is unusual in New Zealand, and believes that coming from outside the system offers a beneficial "outside in perspective" on necessary changes and national improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>.

He had always considered entering political life at some point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>, feeling it is helpful to have prior experience outside of politics to better understand the world and how to assist people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>.

## Transferable Skills from Business
While acknowledging that running a company and a country are "completely different" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>, Chris asserts that many [[entrepreneurship_and_business_advice | skills from business]] are highly transferable to his role as Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>.

Key transferable skills and principles include:
*   **Leadership and Team Building**: The way one leads and builds a team to deliver an agenda is "very, very similar" across both fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>.
*   **Strategic Balance**: The ability to "protect and enhance the good things" while also "provoke and stimulate change" is crucial for any leader, whether a CEO or Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>.
*   **Humility and Learning**: It's essential to "start from the beginning" and avoid assuming success in one sphere translates directly to another. Being humble and curious to learn new things is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>.
*   **Character and Temperament**: Possessing a "good even temperament," not reacting to extreme highs or lows, is a significant trait observed in successful leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:00">[11:28:00]</a>.
*   **Curiosity**: A keenness to continuously learn new things is deemed "really important" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:45:00">[11:45:00]</a>.
*   **Communication Skills**: These are considered "critical" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a>.
*   **Conflict Management and Emotional Intelligence (EQ)**: In [[politics_and_entrepreneurship | politics]], which is a "people business," managing egos and personalities requires high EQ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>.
*   **Economic Orientation**: Having a business and commercial orientation can be helpful, especially in challenging economic times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:17:00">[17:17:00]</a>.
*   **Customer-Centricity**: Applying a "customer mentality" to public service, viewing citizens as customers, can make government delivery more efficient and effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:50:00">[27:50:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Unlearning
The transition requires being "prepared to unlearn things that may have made you successful in one job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:05:00">[29:05:00]</a>. Politics involves "policy areas that are often very layered, very nuanced, very...complex," which cannot be approached simplistically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:20:00">[29:20:00]</a>. Chris highlights that governments often struggle with "problem definition," leading to ineffective solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:39:00">[29:39:00]</a>.

He likens the shift from business to politics to changing sports, from playing cricket to hockey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>. This means starting from the bottom and mastering new skills, such as policy areas, parliamentary workings, party connections, and ultimately, delivering for people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:51:00">[29:51:00]</a>.

## Identity and Perspective
Chris's social media bio prioritizes "first a husband, then a father, then a brother, then a son" before "New Zealand prime minister" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>. This reflects his belief that "it's not what you do, it's actually who you are that matters much more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>. He emphasizes not being defined by a job title, as it can lead to personal shattering when the title is lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.

## Dealing with Public Opinion
Chris maintains that he is "not consumed" by social media, acknowledging the presence of critics but choosing not to let it define him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:55:00">[12:55:00]</a>. He takes advice and feedback but asserts the right to choose whose opinions to consider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:19:00">[15:19:00]</a>. This ability to not let criticism affect him is seen as a "superpower in today's world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:13:00">[14:13:00]</a>. His focus remains on his mission and purpose, investing time in "real human to human connections and relationships" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:57:00">[15:57:00]</a>.

When asked who is harder to deal with—shareholders or voters—Chris unequivocally states "the public" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:05:00">[19:05:00]</a>. He explains that voters have "much more substantive issues" beyond dividends, holding high expectations for improved public services, economic growth, and safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:06:00">[19:06:00]</a>.

## [[the_influence_of_money_in_politics | The Role of Money in Politics]]
Chris highlights that New Zealand has "very tight laws around campaign financing," preventing money from buying influence as observed in other democracies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:06:00">[17:06:00]</a>. Strict independent electoral commission laws limit spending per candidate significantly, ensuring that money is not a barrier for someone to run for parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21:00">[17:21:00]</a>. This system promotes diversity in parliament, welcoming individuals from "all walks of life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:44:00">[18:44:00]</a>.

## Advice for Aspiring Politicians from Business
For individuals transitioning from the corporate world to politics, Chris advises:
*   **Be Prepared to Unlearn**: Let go of methods that worked in business but may not apply to the complex, nuanced policy areas of politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:05:00">[29:05:00]</a>.
*   **Start from the Bottom**: Approach the new field with humility, not assuming immediate success based on past achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:51:00">[29:51:00]</a>.
*   **Master Policy Areas**: Dedicate time to understand the intricate details of policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:04:00">[30:04:00]</a>.
*   **Understand Parliament**: Learn the workings of the legislative body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:06:00">[30:06:00]</a>.
*   **Connect with Your Party**: Build strong relationships and understanding within the political party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:08:00">[30:08:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on Delivery**: Ultimately, the goal is to "deliver for people" and improve their daily lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:09:00">[30:09:00]</a>.

He emphasizes that the success of a transition depends on the individual's "emotional intelligence, the skills, the experience to actually do the jobs properly" rather than their previous job title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:46:00">[33:46:00]</a>. The core principles of leadership and building great organizations are what truly matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:29:00">[32:29:00]</a>.

## Optimism for the Future
Chris expresses optimism for the future, believing that the next generation is "incredibly altruistic" and less burdened by historical prejudice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:09:00">[39:09:00]</a>. He encourages [[youth_in_politics | young people]] who are frustrated with the system to "get involved," "get into the arena," and "be the change that...you want to see" instead of disengaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:55:00">[39:55:00]</a>.

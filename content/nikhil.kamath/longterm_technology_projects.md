The development of technology projects should be approached with a focus on the [[longevity | long term]], embodying the mindset of "marathon runners" rather than "sprinters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This approach guided the broad "[[future_directions_in_building_on_indias_digital_platforms_and_protocols | India stack]] Journey" to build for the [[longevity | long term]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Guiding Principles

A fundamental belief is that [[tech_innovations_and_future_trends | digital technology]], when utilized effectively, possesses the capacity to significantly enhance the lives of individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Noteworthy Initiatives

An example of a long-term technology project is the development of a unique ID. Although initially conceived by the government, it was intentionally made digital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Future Technology Trends

Looking ahead, [[tech_innovations_and_future_trends | AI]] is projected to become as ubiquitous as electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

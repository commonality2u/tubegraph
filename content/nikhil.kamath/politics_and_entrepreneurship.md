This article explores the [[parallels_between_politics_and_entrepreneurship|parallels between politics and entrepreneurship]], suggesting that both fields share many similarities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. The discussion emphasizes that while much has been written about [[entrepreneurship and business strategies|entrepreneurship and business strategies]], the commonalities with politics remain largely unexplored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

## Essential Qualities for Success

### In Politics
For success in politics, several inherent qualities are necessary:
*   **Dedication and Commitment** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>
*   **Empathy and Partnership** People should feel that a politician is a partner in their happiness and sorrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>.
*   **Team Player** An effective politician must be a good team player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>. A leader who dictates orders may win an election but is not guaranteed to be successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>.
*   **Mission over Ambition** Individuals should enter politics with a mission, as ambition alone has a short lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>. Mahatma Gandhi is cited as an example of a leader whose life itself became his message, inspiring a whole nation to rally behind him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>.
*   **Action over Rhetoric** While oratory and communication are important, life ultimately revolves around action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>.
*   **Sensitivity** Politicians need to be highly sensitive to people's needs and experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>.
*   **Honesty and Righteousness** If one is truthful and has done nothing wrong, accusations will not be a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:52">[00:37:52]</a>.
*   **Self-Sacrifice** The speaker believes in sacrificing oneself for the country's dreams, irrespective of whose dreams they are, as long as they are true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:48">[00:32:48]</a>.

### In Entrepreneurship
Similar to politics, [[entrepreneurship and startup success|startup success]] requires specific talents. For instance, good marketing and sales skills, or technological prowess for product development, are essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.

## Personal Background and Motivation
The speaker was born in Vadnagar, a small town in North Gujarat, with a population of about 15,000 during his childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. His village was part of the Gaekwad State, which emphasized education, having a pond, post office, and library <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. He learned to swim in the pond and attended a charitable high school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

He describes himself as an "average student" in academics but very active in other pursuits, instantly catching onto new things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. He had no interest in competitive exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

His journey into public life meant leaving home at a very young age, losing touch with childhood friends and family for a long period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. Upon becoming Chief Minister, he sought to reconnect with school friends and publicly honored his teachers, including his oldest teacher who was 93 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. He also gathered his extended family, many of whom he didn't know, and met families who had fed him during his early life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.

His experiences, including observing women walking miles for water in his childhood, instilled in him a deep desire to provide basic necessities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:12">[00:32:12]</a>. He views "problems" as his "biggest university" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:52">[00:31:52]</a>. His life's mantra as Chief Minister included:
*   Unwavering hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>.
*   Selflessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>.
*   Acknowledging mistakes but never acting with bad intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:18">[00:33:18]</a>.

## Views on Ideology and Perception

The speaker adheres to a core ideology of "Nation First" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:24">[00:35:24]</a>. He is open to embracing new approaches while letting go of old ones, as long as they serve the nation first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>.

In politics, idealism is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:39">[00:36:39]</a>. The freedom movement, for example, was driven by the idea of independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:48">[00:36:48]</a>.

### Public Perception
While the public often tethers [[politics and global leaders|politics]] to elections, power, or defeat, the speaker emphasizes that these are merely aspects of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:03">[00:58:03]</a>. [[leadership_and_politics|Politics]] should be seen on a much broader canvas, including social work and policy-making, which can bring about significant national change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:59">[01:02:59]</a>. He argues that voters are also politicians, using their judgment when casting their vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:09">[01:15:09]</a>.

The speaker believes that politics is not inherently dirty; rather, politicians can make it so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:08">[01:20:08]</a>. To change this perception, society must respect politics, encouraging good people to join <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">[00:55:50]</a>.

## Challenges and Learning from Setbacks

### Personal Challenges
The speaker recounts facing abuse and criticism since early in his career, even when not directly involved in politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>. He learned to detach from such negativity, viewing it as something *given* that he doesn't have to *take* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:53">[00:39:53]</a>.

He describes major life tests, such as the 2002 Gujarat elections, where he detached himself from the outcome despite significant pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:52">[00:45:52]</a>. He also recalls visiting a police control room after a series of bomb blasts, overriding security concerns because his focus was entirely on the mission and responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:08">[00:47:08]</a>.

### Learning from Failures
The speaker sees setbacks as crucial for personal development. His childhood dream of attending a Sainik school was thwarted by financial constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>. Later, his desire to lead a saintly life by joining the Ramakrishna Mission was also unsuccessful due to not meeting their qualifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:11">[01:04:11]</a>. Despite these unfulfilled dreams, he was not disappointed, believing destiny led him elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:28">[01:04:28]</a>.

He emphasizes that failures are the primary teachers in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:41">[00:52:41]</a>. The Chandrayaan-2 mission, which failed at the last second, taught him about taking responsibility for failure while instilling confidence in his team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:03">[00:54:03]</a>. This experience also highlighted the importance of [[risktaking in entrepreneurship|risk-taking in entrepreneurship]] and politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>.

## Risk-Taking and Comfort Zones
The speaker states his own [[risktaking in entrepreneurship|risk-taking]] capacity is largely unutilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:24">[01:09:24]</a>. He believes this is because he "doesn't care at all" about himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:40">[01:09:40]</a>. His approach is characterized by "zero fear" and a willingness to make decisions others wouldn't, driven by a "one life, one mission" philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:08">[01:10:08]</a>.

He asserts that remaining in one's comfort zone leads to failure in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:14">[01:18:14]</a>. To achieve progress in any field, one must venture outside their comfort zone and embrace risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:50">[01:18:50]</a>.

## Role of Technology and Governance
The speaker highlights India's technological advancements, such as India Stack, Direct Beneficiary Transfer (DBT), UPI, and Aadhaar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:18">[01:31:18]</a>. These technologies have enabled direct money transfers to millions, reduced corruption, and transformed governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:42">[01:31:42]</a>. UPI is described as a global marvel that democratizes technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:12">[01:32:12]</a>.

Regarding "Minimum Government, Maximum Governance," the speaker clarifies that this does not mean reducing ministers or employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:29">[01:29:29]</a>. Instead, it involves streamlining processes, reducing compliance burdens, and repealing outdated laws to make governance more efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:16">[01:30:16]</a>.

## Encouraging Youth to Join Politics
The speaker strongly encourages young people to enter politics. He believes that politics is a field in public life that needs leadership born from creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:09">[02:04:09]</a>. He appeals to young women, citing existing reservations in local governance and upcoming reservations for MLAs and MPs, urging them to develop [[leadership_and_politics|leadership qualities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:17">[02:02:17]</a>.

He reassures young people that politics does not necessarily require significant money, referencing an incident where a doctor successfully ran an election by collecting one rupee from each person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:03">[01:21:03]</a>. He distinguishes between simply contesting elections and being a successful politician who wins people's hearts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:23">[00:29:23]</a>.

## Evolution of Leadership and Future Vision
The speaker shares his [[transition_from_business_to_politics|transition from business to politics]] and his evolving leadership style. His first term as Prime Minister involved understanding both himself and Delhi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:31">[01:57:31]</a>. His second term saw him expand his thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:45">[01:57:45]</a>. For his third term, his courage and dreams have expanded further, driven by a vision for a "Developed India" by 2047 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:56">[01:57:56]</a>. This vision focuses on 100% delivery of government services, ensuring everyone receives their rights without discrimination, which he equates to true social justice and secularism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:55">[01:58:55]</a>.

He emphasizes the importance of preparing future leaders, stating that his goal is to train individuals to handle national affairs for the next 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:27">[02:00:27]</a>.

## India's Global Standing
The speaker asserts that India's credibility and profile on the world stage have significantly increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. He cites the trust other nations place in India's word, particularly during crises like the Ukraine-Russia conflict, where India maintains a stance "in favor of peace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:41">[01:42:41]</a>.

He also notes a shift in the aspirations of Indian youth, who are now less focused on going abroad for education and careers, instead preferring to "build in India" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:36">[01:38:36]</a>.

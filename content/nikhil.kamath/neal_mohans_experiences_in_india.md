When asked about the concept of "masks" that people wear, which change depending on who they are with, and specifically how this applies to him when he visits India as the CEO of YouTube, Neal Mohan stated that he is "not very sophisticated in masks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. He indicated that his demeanor is consistent, suggesting that "what you see is what you get" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

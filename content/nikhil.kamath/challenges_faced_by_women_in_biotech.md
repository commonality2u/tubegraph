Starting a career in biotechnology, particularly for women, has historically presented unique hurdles in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Perceptions and Resistance
When Kiran Mazumdar Shaw's father suggested she pursue brewing, a field he was involved in, her immediate reaction was, "Are you nuts? I'm a woman, how will I do it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This highlights the inherent societal perceptions and gender roles that can act as a barrier to women entering certain industries.

## Navigating a Nascent Industry
Biotechnology itself was a "strange business" that "nobody understood" when Biocon was founded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Bankers were hesitant to engage with such an unfamiliar venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Starting Biocon required "foolish courage" due to the uncertainty and lack of understanding surrounding the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. These [[challenges_faced_by_startups_in_india | challenges]] were compounded for a woman pioneering in an unknown sector.

## Underrepresentation of Women in the Workforce
In India, the number of [[challenges_faced_by_women_entrepreneurs | women in the workforce]] is notably low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This statistic indicates a broader systemic issue that impacts [[entrepreneurship_and_women_in_tech | women in tech]] and biotech, suggesting that women face obstacles not just in starting a business, but in gaining entry and progression within professional environments.

### Carl (Nothing)
Carl, a co-founder of [[Emerging Trends in Consumer Electronics and HealthTech | Nothing]], was a passionate tech fan from a young age, inspired by products like the first iPod, iPhone, and iPad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. He recalled the complex FireWire connection for the original iPod and the skeuomorphic UI of the first iPad, where even the light source of graphics changed when the device was tilted, demonstrating Apple's meticulous attention to detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. These experiences fueled his interest in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. He later joined Meizu, which was known as the "Apple of China" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>, and then co-founded OnePlus, leveraging OPPO's supply chain to build an online-first brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. At OnePlus, international sales quickly surpassed China's, leading to a pivot focusing on global markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. After seven years, Carl departed to found Nothing in 2020, aiming to impact how people use technology beyond just implementing existing solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

### Rahul (Micromax)
Rahul, a co-founder of Micromax, grew up in Delhi with a strong desire to start his own business, despite coming from a family with no entrepreneurial background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>. He wanted to do something "different, something big, something meaningful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>. His journey began with software development, including B2B e-commerce engines, before pivoting to embedded technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>. A key turning point was identifying a need for fixed wireless terminals to power payphones in India, a market unaddressed by traditional landlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a>. This business grew rapidly, generating 100 crore rupees annually by 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>. His "Mobile ka Baap" phone, with its one-month battery life, stemmed from observations in rural areas where electricity was scarce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:46">[00:42:46]</a>. Similarly, the dual-SIM phone idea came from observing his cook using multiple SIM cards due to varying call rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08">[00:46:08]</a>. This approach of finding gaps from everyday life and local needs was crucial for Micromax's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:10">[00:47:10]</a>.

### Amit (Noise)
Amit, a co-founder of Noise, came from a small town in Rajasthan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:06">[01:09:06]</a>. His entrepreneurial spirit was ignited in college when he sought alternative income sources to compensate for limited pocket money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>. He started his first business in fashion accessories in 2007, based out of Hong Kong, working with brands like H&M <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:50">[01:15:50]</a>. This experience instilled in him the value of "good-quality product at an affordable price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:42">[01:16:42]</a>. Noise began in 2014 by addressing the lack of iPhone covers in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:31">[01:17:31]</a>. After initial failures and facing commoditization in mobile accessories, they pivoted to smartwatches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:09">[01:19:09]</a>. They identified a significant market gap for affordable smartwatches, as existing options like Fitbit were too expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:07">[01:20:07]</a>. Noise bootstrapped its way to success, believing this allowed them to make decisions for the long-term benefit of the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:23">[01:22:23]</a>.

## The Role of Design in Differentiation

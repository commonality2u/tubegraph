When considering [[entrepreneurship_and_business_strategies | entrepreneurship and business strategies]], particularly for [[young entrepreneurs | young entrepreneurs]], two distinct approaches emerge for establishing a venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Challenging Incumbents

A bold approach involves aiming for "foundational" innovation rather than building upon existing dominant platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This strategy entails directly challenging established giants like Bill Gates' ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This "screw you Bill Gates" mindset is considered commendable for its audacity in [[entrepreneurial_strategy_and_decision_making | entrepreneurial strategy and decision making]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Building on Existing Platforms

Alternatively, a less confrontational, but still effective, strategy suggests utilizing existing major platforms, such as those offered by Google or Microsoft, particularly in the realm of AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This approach involves leveraging established infrastructure to build new services or products on top of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Hypothetical Scenario for Strategy Development

When considering [[challenges_and_strategies_of_indian_startups | challenges and strategies of Indian startups]], a hypothetical scenario for [[entrepreneurial_strategy_and_decision_making | entrepreneurial strategy and decision making]] involves a 25-year-old in India with $100,000 to invest in starting a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. The choice between a foundational, bold approach or building on existing platforms would be a critical decision in such a situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

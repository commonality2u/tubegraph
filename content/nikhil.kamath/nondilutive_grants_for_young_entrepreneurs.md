The WTFund is presented as a grant, not a traditional fund, designed to support the community, specifically young individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. It targets young people under the age of 25 with great ideas who lack the necessary funds to execute them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This initiative seeks to provide non-dilutive grants to founders aged 25 and under <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## The Funding Process
The WTFund began with 1,500 applications, which were then narrowed down to a shortlist of 160 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Ultimately, the first nine startups were chosen to be funded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. One applicant discovered the WTFund through Nuseir Yasin (Nas Daily)'s podcast, prompting them to apply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

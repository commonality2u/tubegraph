Traffic violations can lead to negative consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Specific violations mentioned include making a traffic violation in general <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a> and breaking a signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Public Perception and Management

The issue of [[Bangalore_traffic_issues | Bangalore traffic issues]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>, including violations, is a frequent point of discussion, with people often bringing up "traffic, traffic, traffic" when [[Bangalore_traffic_issues | Bangalore]] is mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### Political Influence
There is a perspective that the new commissioner "doesn't listen to any of us" and "does whatever he wants" regarding [[traffic_management_and_solutions_in_Bangalore | traffic management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. It is pondered whether [[politician_perspectives_on_traffic_management | politicians]] are found accountable when signals are broken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

### Solutions
The discussion acknowledges the need for [[longterm_solutions_for_Bangalore_traffic | long-term solutions for Bangalore's problems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, particularly concerning traffic.

## Personal Political Aspirations

When asked about future [[political_aspirations_and_involvement | political aspirations]], it was stated that there is "no intent whatsoever" to be involved in [[political_aspirations_and_involvement | politics]], at least not currently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Youth Optimism and Involvement

There is a observation that generations born after 1995 or 2000 may not possess the same optimism regarding [[public_perception_of_politics | politics]] that previous generations did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. To address this, a request was made for these individuals to "get involved" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. It was suggested that instead of remaining on the sidelines, commenting from behind a keyboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, individuals should "get into the arena and actually give it a go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, emphasizing active [[youth_involvement_in_politics | youth involvement in politics]] rather than mere commentary, which can sometimes be seen as the [[role_of_content_creators_in_politics | role of content creators in politics]].

The concept of detachment is a significant theme in the speaker's personal life, particularly in shaping his [[Personal relationships and identity | personal identity]] and his approach to relationships. He recounts how a podcast segment on "Detachment" resonated deeply with him, as it was something he connected with but was initially afraid to openly express <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Roots of Detachment

The speaker identifies himself as having always been a detached person, even from a very young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>. He describes this as being "avoidant attached" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>, a term connected to [[defining_personal_attachment_styles_and_psychological_aspects | defining personal attachment styles and psychological aspects]]. This detachment may stem from a faint childhood memory at age four or five, where a friend's departure caused intense internal pain, leading him to "close up" and detach from everybody <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.

This trait manifested in his relationship with his father, which he describes as distant though filled with love and respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:33">[00:33:33]</a>. Despite his father's passing, he notes he did not cry, struggling to express himself or grieve the loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>. He later acknowledged feeling guilt for not having the "grace to let go of the distance or the glass" between them to show affection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:48">[00:34:48]</a>. He attributes his emotional suppression to growing up in a home with frequent parental arguments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:25">[00:33:25]</a> and the perception that men of his father's generation were "scared of vulnerability" and not expressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. He learned to stop crying very early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>.

He also notes that his professional image as a "playboy" or "casanova," based on his dating life, was not entirely true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:15">[00:54:15]</a>. He explains this was a public perception, not a reflection of his true self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:01">[00:54:01]</a>, and he eventually stopped caring about such labels because they were mere "commodity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:03">[00:55:03]</a>.

## Challenges to Detachment

The birth of his daughter has been a "game changer," causing him to "question detachment and indifference" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>. He feels "reborn" and is experiencing new emotions and feelings, including a newfound fear of death, as he now wants to live longer for his daughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>. This represents a significant shift in his [[Philosophy on life and personal growth | philosophy on life and personal growth]].

Despite his past struggles with emotional expression, he believes in a monogamous, committed relationship, emphasizing that "one woman forever" is the "only healthy way of living" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:21">[00:55:21]</a>. He values not hurting his wife or daughter and ensuring they never question him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:40">[00:55:40]</a>. He describes his wife as his best friend, with whom he can genuinely chat and laugh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>. He acknowledges that she has made more efforts to adjust in their marriage than he has <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:04">[00:58:04]</a>, highlighting the compromises necessary for a successful [[Personal relationships and identity | personal relationship]].

## Current Stance on Detachment

While acknowledging his past and ongoing tendency towards detachment, he describes himself as "still attached" to things while simultaneously "pretending to be detached and also being convinced of being detached myself a lot of the time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>. This suggests a nuanced and evolving understanding of his own emotional state and how it relates to [[The concept of masks and personal identity | his personal identity]].

His philosophy on life, influenced by figures like Jiddu Krishnamurti, encourages accepting feelings as they come without questioning them. He states, "I don't mind what happens. If I'm in pain, if I'm feeling sad, I will feel sad and I don't question it. I'll go through the beats of it. If I'm happy, I'll go through the beats of it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:06">[01:25:06]</a>. This aligns with a form of acceptance, even if the initial journey to that acceptance involved detachment.

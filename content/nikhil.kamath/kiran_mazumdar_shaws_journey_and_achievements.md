Kiran Mazumdar Shaw is an Indian entrepreneur and the founder of Biocon, a leading biopharmaceutical company based in Bangalore. Her philosophy emphasizes that wealth is not about money, but about value creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:46">[01:05:46]</a>. She believes in creating value through knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:15">[01:06:15]</a>.

## Early Life and Education
Kiran Mazumdar Shaw was born and raised in Bangalore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:33">[02:47:33]</a>. She attended Bishop Cotton Girls' School, then Mount Carmel College for pre-university, and Central College at Bangalore University for her bachelor's degree in Zoology Honors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:16">[02:52:16]</a>. She topped the university and earned a gold medal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:08">[04:13:08]</a>.

Her initial plan was to attend medical school, applying to institutions like Saint John's and Vellore, but she did not gain admission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:13">[03:39:13]</a>. She considered pursuing a PhD in genetics at London University <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:41">[04:24:41]</a>.

### Influence of her Father
Her late father, who was the managing director and head brewmaster of United Breweries in Bangalore, suggested she study brewing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:17">[04:46:17]</a>. He was the original creator of Kingfisher beer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:06">[04:56:06]</a>. Despite her initial hesitation as a woman entering a male-dominated profession, her father convinced her that brewing was the oldest biotechnology and very exciting given her interest in microbiology, genetics, and fermentation science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:03">[05:11:03]</a>. He arranged for her to pursue a Master's in Brewing at Ballarat University in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:48">[05:40:48]</a>. She went to Australia in 1974, celebrating her 21st birthday there, and was the only woman in her class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:44">[06:23:44]</a>.

## [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_challenges | Entrepreneurial Journey]] and Initial Challenges
Upon returning to India in late 1975 or early 1976 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:37">[01:40:37]</a>, she struggled to find employment as a brewmaster despite topping her class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48:47">[01:40:47]</a>. Breweries were willing to use her for troubleshooting but refused to hire her, citing the perceived "risk" of a woman leading a brewery due to "hostile labor unions" and the lack of women in leadership positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:17:15">[01:40:51]</a>. This experience was very disillusioning, as she realized the country was not ready for a woman brewmaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:44:03">[01:40:57]</a>.

### Founding Biocon
In 1978, while preparing to take a job in Scotland, she had an "accidental encounter" with Les Hawkins, an Irish biotech entrepreneur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47:04">[01:41:01]</a>. Hawkins, who knew of her from her Australian days, tracked her down in Baroda to propose starting an enzyme technology company in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:02:08">[01:41:04]</a>.

She initially declined, citing several [[challenges_faced_by_women_entrepreneurs | challenges as a woman in business]] in India at the time:
*   The country was not welcoming of women in business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:22:20">[01:42:04]</a>.
*   She had no money to her name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:37:37">[01:42:05]</a>.
*   She lacked business experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:46:17">[01:42:06]</a>.
*   There were very few prominent women in business in India in the 1970s, apart from Rati Muraji <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:02:18">[01:42:07]</a>.

Hawkins persisted, emphasizing that entrepreneurship required "hunger in your belly" and an exciting idea, not money or prior experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:41:26">[01:42:12]</a>. With her father's encouragement and Hawkins' assurance to find her a job if the venture failed, she decided to take the leap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:11:00">[01:42:15]</a>.

She started Biocon at the age of 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:14:03">[01:42:25]</a> with 10,000 rupees in her bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:39:10">[01:42:26]</a> and a 10,000 pound advance from Hawkins as a buyback guarantee for the enzymes she would produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:57:04">[01:42:30]</a>. She faced significant gender bias, with bankers demanding her father's guarantee despite accepting male entrepreneurs' guarantees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:38:00">[01:42:33]</a>. A "brave banker," Dinesh Nayak from Canara Bank, eventually gave her a credit line based on her story and the draft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:40:02">[01:42:36]</a>. She started Biocon in a garage shed, very frugally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:21:40">[01:42:39]</a>.

## Building Biocon and Pivoting to Biopharmaceuticals
Biocon initially focused on enzyme technologies, which were "an idea ahead of its time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:59:44">[01:42:43]</a>. These technologies aimed to replace polluting chemical processes with eco-friendly bio-transformation and biocatalysis for applications like effluent treatment and the paper and pulp industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:07:07">[01:42:45]</a>.

Initially, she found it hard to hire people who wanted to work for a woman, with her first two employees being retired tractor mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:42:07">[01:42:48]</a>. Later, after being featured in publications like Business World and India Today, she attracted talented young professionals, including engineers from IIT and a PhD from MIT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:50:39">[01:42:54]</a>. She credits her success to focusing on getting good people and the right leadership team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:25:21">[01:43:03]</a>. She believes in delegating and sharing responsibilities and equity, while a founder should aim to hold maximum equity to drive the company's direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:49:59">[01:43:05]</a>.

Ten years into the partnership, her Irish partners sold their stake to Unilever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:47:04">[01:43:08]</a>. This was an inflection point, as Unilever introduced Biocon to global benchmarks and professionalism, particularly in areas like financial reporting, good manufacturing practices, compliance, and intellectual property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:05:05">[01:43:10]</a>.

In 1998, the same year she married John Shaw, Unilever decided to sell their stake to ICI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:01:03">[01:43:16]</a>. Leveraging a preemptive clause in her original contract, she and John bought out Unilever's 30% stake for $2 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:31:00">[01:43:17]</a>. John Shaw sold his life savings, including a townhouse in Chelsea, London, to finance the acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:13:00">[01:43:18]</a>. John, who was chairman and managing director of Madura Coats, brought significant professionalism to her thinking and provided crucial advice on dealing with large conglomerates like Unilever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:01:46">[01:43:20]</a>. He was known for his lack of insecurity and never sought attention, despite her being the protagonist of the Biocon story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:29:13">[01:43:24]</a>.

By 2000, they sold 10% of the acquired stock to ICICI Ventures for $2 million, marking a significant appreciation in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:27:00">[01:43:27]</a>. By 2003, Biocon was valued at 400 crores when AIG acquired ICICI Ventures' stake, and a year later, the company was valued at a billion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:16:00">[01:43:29]</a>.

Around 2000, she made the strategic decision to pivot from enzymes to biopharmaceuticals, recognizing that enzymes alone would limit Biocon's growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:12:00">[01:43:32]</a>. This pivot leveraged existing enzyme technologies into a new domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:40:48">[01:43:32]</a>. She believes entrepreneurs must challenge themselves to reinvent, anticipate market needs, and be "agnostic" to a technology's initial product to explore other applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:22">[01:43:57]</a>.

Biocon became a leading producer of statins, cholesterol-reducing drugs, from fungal fermentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:10:00">[01:43:38]</a>. Today, Biocon holds a 50% global market share in Statin APIs (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients) and a 40% market share in atorvastatin and rosuvastatin in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:57:00">[01:43:43]</a>. They also have a significant presence in immunosuppressants used by transplant patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:29:40">[01:43:46]</a>.

### Insulin and IPO
A major achievement was developing recombinant human insulin starting in 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:04">[01:43:53]</a>. Recognizing India's high diabetes burden and reliance on expensive imported animal insulins, she sought to make human insulin affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:04">[01:43:53]</a>. In 2004, Biocon launched India's first recombinant human insulin, dramatically reducing prices and forcing competitors to follow suit, eventually phasing out animal insulin usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:17">[01:43:54]</a>.

Biocon's IPO occurred in 2004, coinciding with the launch of insulin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:53">[01:43:56]</a>. This launched her into fame as "India's richest self-made woman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:54">[01:44:03]</a>. She views an IPO as creating a "capital value" or "currency" for a company, enabling further growth through acquisitions and investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:40">[01:44:07]</a>.

## Continued Growth and Philanthropy
In 2007, she made the "hard decision" to divest Biocon's original enzyme business to its biggest competitor, Novozymes, to focus investments on biopharmaceuticals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:44:19]</a>. This move yielded a significant return and demonstrated the value of the IP she had created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:01">[01:44:21]</a>.

Biocon also spun off a subsidiary, Syngene, a research services company, which went public in 2015 and is now valued at approximately $4.5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:10">[01:44:09]</a>. Biocon monetized 10% of Syngene for over $300 million to fund a recent major acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:31">[01:44:10]</a>.

The company's current focus is on biosimilars, a complex and innovative field similar to developing new drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:41">[01:44:28]</a>. Biocon is the only Indian company to have successfully developed biosimilars for global markets (US and Europe) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:50">[01:44:31]</a>. In November 2022, Biocon completed a $3 billion acquisition of the commercial operations of its biosimilar partner, Viatris, a move she describes as "game-changing" and "transformative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:51">[01:44:35]</a>. This positions Biocon Biologics to be the number one biosimilars company globally, with a broad portfolio and deep pipeline, poised to capture value from over $100 billion of biologic drugs coming off patent in the next decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:57">[01:44:36]</a>.

Kiran Mazumdar Shaw is also an active philanthropist, believing that when one does not have children, there is a tendency to be more philanthropic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:15">[01:44:57]</a>. She signed the Giving Pledge and focuses on making large, substantial investments in research and higher education to leverage India's demographic dividend by creating an educated young population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:09">[01:44:58]</a>.

## Views on Entrepreneurship and Societal Issues
### Entrepreneurial Principles:
*   **Differentiation:** Always aim to lead the way and never be a "me too" company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:05">[01:44:48]</a>.
*   **Risk-Taking:** Be willing to take bigger risks than others, as this leads to differentiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:14">[01:44:49]</a>.
*   **Future-Proofing:** Entrepreneurs need to anticipate the future and invest in embedded risk to future-proof their business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:44">[01:44:52]</a>.
*   **Learning from Mistakes:** Mistakes are opportunities to learn and grow faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:09">[01:44:27]</a>.
*   **Developing Talent:** She prides herself on having created at least 100 entrepreneurs from Biocon over 40 years, fostering an entrepreneurial ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>.

### Insights on Vijay Mallya's Downfall:
She attributes [[kishore_biyanis_return_to_ecommerce | Vijay Mallya]]'s downfall, particularly with Kingfisher Airlines, to his inability to "pull the plug" and his denial of warning signs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:55">[01:41:40]</a>. She advised him to downsize and cut losses, but he remained in denial, believing he could overcome the crisis and raise debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:54">[01:41:41]</a>. She emphasizes that it was not ego, but a passion for the airline and a refusal to fail, which ultimately led to its non-viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:36">[01:41:47]</a>.

### India's Landscape:
She is optimistic about India's current position, citing favorable geopolitics, the digital revolution (e.g., Aadhaar, digital payments), and government policies as key drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:05">[01:45:00]</a>. She highlights the need for continued investment in infrastructure, fully capital account convertible rupee, and stable tax policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:19">[01:45:05]</a>.

On [[women_in_the_indian_workforce | women in the Indian workforce]], she notes the very low numbers compared to other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:37">[01:45:06]</a>. She points out that the venture funding industry is skewed towards male-run businesses because money is predominantly in the hands of men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:07">[01:45:07]</a>. Women still face significant [[challenges_faced_by_women_entrepreneurs | challenges in raising capital]], often judged on their style rather than business fundamentals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:17">[01:45:08]</a>. She actively pushes for increased female representation in leadership roles and on the shop floor within her own company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:36">[01:45:10]</a>.

## Personal Resilience
Kiran Mazumdar Shaw describes being "devastated" by the loss of her mother and husband, John Shaw, recognizing the huge void in her life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:07">[01:45:26]</a>. However, she remains driven and passionate about her work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:28">[01:45:26]</a>. Her late mother's advice to "not waste your life" and to "live your life to the fullest" has been a powerful source of strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:16">[01:45:27]</a>. She believes in philosophical acceptance of life's unpredictability and focusing on making the most of every moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:09">[01:45:27]</a>.

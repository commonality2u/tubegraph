## Nature of the Business
The office leasing business is characterized as operating at "hyperspeed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. It is identified as "the most difficult business you can be in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Key Strategies and Approaches
Succeeding in this sector demands making [[bold_approaches_in_business_strategy | bold calls]] and taking "a lot of risk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Despite its challenges, there's a need to "learn to love all of that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Challenges
A notable characteristic of the broader real estate domain, which includes office leasing, is the significant proportion of legal disputes that are "land related," estimated to be "70 to 80% of all court cases" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Perspective on Passion and Profit
When faced with a decision between pursuing something passionately that results in financial loss, versus doing something dispassionately that generates income, the latter is preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. The approach is to prioritize making money and then finding other avenues for passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. It's suggested that while one may not initially "love what I do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, it's possible to "learn to love" the business over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

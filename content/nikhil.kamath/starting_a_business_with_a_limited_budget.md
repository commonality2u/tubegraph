When considering [[starting_a_business | starting a business]] with a limited budget, such as $100,000 for a 25-year-old in India [00:00:50], a key strategy involves leveraging existing technological platforms.

## Leveraging Existing Platforms
For [[entrepreneurship_for_beginners | young entrepreneurs]], a recommended approach is to "pick some AI thing" and utilize platforms provided by major tech companies like Google or Microsoft [00:00:25]. This method involves building upon existing infrastructure rather than developing foundational technology from scratch [00:00:27].

This strategy can be particularly relevant when working with a defined initial investment [00:00:57].

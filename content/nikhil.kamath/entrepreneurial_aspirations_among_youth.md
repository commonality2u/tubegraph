The conversation often focuses on [[young_entrepreneurship_and_startup_culture | young, aspiring 20-year-old individuals]]—both boys and girls—who aim to [[entrepreneurship_and_starting_anew | start a business]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40"></a>. These aspirations are frequently driven by a desire to be seen as "desirable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45"></a>.

## Motivations and Desirability

A key motivation for young individuals pursuing [[young_entrepreneurship_and_startup_culture | entrepreneurship]] is the pursuit of desirability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45"></a>. This desirability extends to aspects like securing funding and being sought after <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48"></a>. Young people embarking on [[new_age_entrepreneurial_ventures | new age entrepreneurial ventures]] or seeking to build something for themselves want to achieve a status where they are considered desirable, both in terms of obtaining funding and being wanted in influential circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41"></a>. This desire is about having people interested in them when they are in a room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54"></a>.

## Emulating Success

There is an innate quality that can be "inculcated" (developed) in many people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56"></a>. The goal is to teach young individuals how to emulate the traits that make someone intriguing and interesting to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15"></a>. The discussion aims to explore how personal qualities, possibly rooted in [[the_role_of_childhood_experiences_in_shaping_entrepreneurs | childhood experiences]], contribute to this ability to leave people intrigued and wanting more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06"></a>.

## Entrepreneurial Traits and Business Ventures

When discussing [[entrepreneurship_and_sales | entrepreneurship]] and roles within the film industry, patience and the ability to sacrifice are highlighted as crucial for a long career in the arts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40"></a>. For a director, being extremely selfless and giving is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:02"></a>. A producer, in particular, needs to be a "people person" capable of bringing together large teams and inspiring them to create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07"></a>. This trait of a producer is likened to that of a politician, as it involves uniting many people towards a common goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:10"></a>. For an actor, a "childlike imagination" and avoiding cynicism are important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:29"></a>.

Regarding investment in businesses, it is noted that consciously, people are nicer to investors before they get funded, rather than after <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:21"></a>. Learning about new industries and fields is described as accelerating and alleviating anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:32"></a>.

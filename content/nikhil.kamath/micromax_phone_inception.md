The first Micromax phone was conceived and launched with a tagline of "mobile kebab" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Its unique selling proposition was an extended battery life, offering a 30-day standby time, which resulted in the phones selling out within 10 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This focus on battery life addressed a significant [[market_need_for_extended_battery_life_phones | market need for extended battery life phones]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Inspiration from Rural India

The idea for the Micromax phone stemmed from observations of daily life and infrastructure challenges in rural India.

### AEL ISDPCO Booth Observation
An encounter at an AEL ISDPCO booth in a village provided key insights into the practical needs of phone users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>:
*   **Power Source** There was no electricity in the village, so the booth relied on a large truck battery for power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   **Signal Reception** Despite a lack of signal in homes, the booth managed to draw signals using a large 20 dB gain antenna mounted on a pole on a terrace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
*   **Battery Charging Solution** To charge the truck battery, the operator had to travel 11 km to a village with electricity, charging it overnight after shutting down the booth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   **Economic Viability** The operator earned around 4,000 rupees a month, which was considered a significant income in a village lacking electricity and entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

### Bihar Travel Experience
Further inspiration came from traveling in the interiors of Bihar, where people charged 25 to 40 rupees to charge a mobile phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. These observations directly led to the decision to develop a phone with a long battery life, specifically aiming for one month of battery backup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This focus on practical needs and an innovative solution for power limitations highlights a key aspect of [[Emerging Technologies and Innovations in India | emerging technologies and innovations in India]].

From: [[nikhil.kamath]] <br/> 

This article explores various facets of personal and professional growth through the experiences and reflections shared by the speaker. It covers childhood influences, career evolution, family dynamics, and a [[philosophy_on_life_and_personal_growth | philosophy on life and personal growth]] regarding success, challenges, and personal fulfillment.

## Childhood and Early Life

The speaker was born in Shimoga, Karnataka, and his father worked in Canara Bank, leading to frequent transfers every three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. He moved from Shimoga to Hassen, then to Karnal in Haryana for three years, where he had great experiences and still maintains friendships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. From age seven until 37, he was primarily based in Bangalore, a city he deeply loves and credits with giving him everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. He believes Bangalore has a distinct soul compared to Mumbai, which must be experienced firsthand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

## Reflections on Being a Public Figure

The speaker notes that film actors' relationships with Indian entertainment media can be "shaky" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Media often focuses on their [[personal_relationships_and_identity | personal life]]—such as marriage, fatherhood, or family—rather than their films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. He believes interviews should be done only when there is something inspiring to say, sharing personal experiences to inspire others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. He is not interested in talking about his own achievements unless it can stimulate or inspire someone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

On the perception of Indian celebrities, the speaker feels they often shy away from being vocal about their true selves, presenting a "media-trained facet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>. He believes people connect with flaws and vulnerabilities, not just a proper image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:45">[00:31:45]</a>. However, as an actor, he has tried to maintain a mysterious aura to avoid audience boredom due to overexposure on social media, endorsements, and film promotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>.

> "I feel like if the real version of you with the flaws the vulnerabilities the strength all of that is depicted in a manner which is truly organic to you I I would assume like there will be some people who will troll you and dislike you and all of that but net net if you then sell sneakers I think more will sell I personally believe that cuz when you're buying George Clooney tequila what are you really buying you're buying him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>

## Professional Journey and Identity

As an entrepreneur, the speaker observes that young aspiring individuals often want to start businesses to be desirable and wanted, particularly for funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. He strives to teach young people how to emulate the innate quality of being intriguing and leaving people interested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

### Early Career and Education
The speaker recounts his educational journey:
*   Attended Bombay Scottish School, where he realized early on that acting didn't require extensive studying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   He was an introvert and not good at dramatics in school, but football gave him a sense of purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
*   He was treated like any other student, often disciplined by teachers, who he felt "picked on" him more due to his celebrity kid status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   He scored 54.3% in his 10th standard boards, a result that brought immense happiness to his family, who had a history of school dropouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
*   He assisted his father on the film *Aa Ab Laut Chalen*, realizing his father was a great actor but lacked the temperament for directing due to being short-tempered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. A good director needs to be selfless, do everyone's job, and give them credit, while also playing "God" on set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   He attended HR College in Mumbai but spent most of his time at a bowling alley, never really seeing a classroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.
*   He went to School of Visual Arts in New York for film direction, realizing his passion leaned more towards directing than acting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
*   He dropped out of the four-year undergrad course after completing film classes, then later enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, though he wasn't a fan of their "method" acting approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
*   His father kept him on a very tight budget in New York, allowing only $2 for lunch and $2 for dinner, to teach him the value of money and how to live like a student <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. Even upon returning to Mumbai, his father took away his car and withheld pocket money when he assisted on the film *Black*, to "school" him about hardship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

### Evolution as an Actor
Initially, the speaker was regarded as a "Playboy guy" and a "casanova" due to dating successful actresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>. He was even labeled a "cheater," which bothered him because it wasn't entirely true and upset his parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:01">[00:54:01]</a>. He eventually realized he was a "commodity" in the industry and stopped taking media narratives too seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>.

His career had early setbacks, including assisting on *Black*, a very demanding experience working 14-15 hours a day under a short-tempered director, which "hardened" him for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:50">[01:07:50]</a>. His debut film *Saawariya* was a "big disaster," but he is grateful for the setback as it further prepared him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:31">[01:08:31]</a>.

A turning point was *Wake Up Sid*, where director Ayan told him he was "ruining the film" by playing the part like a hero instead of a character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:17">[01:09:17]</a>. This clicked, teaching him that he could play characters, not just the quintessential hero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:38">[01:09:38]</a>. This realization guided his future film choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:48">[01:09:48]</a>. His father often disapproved of his chosen films (e.g., *Wake Up Sid*, *Rockstar*, *Rocket Singh*), preferring more commercial movies for him to be a "Bonafide Star of India" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">[01:10:05]</a>. However, he found that his commercial attempts never worked out, while films chosen for their story and character resonated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:26">[01:10:26]</a>.

For him, the audience's reaction matters most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>. He views his work as a "service industry," providing entertainment, and takes it as an honor rather than a sacrifice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:59">[01:13:59]</a>. He believes his current success, including *Animal* which helped him "take another step up" from a stagnating career, is due to choosing the right film at the right time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:15">[01:18:15]</a>.

> "The kind of um see I was kind of stagnating and hitting a saturation point in my career I was called the next Superstar for a very long time and I I'm not saying I'm a superstar today unless you don't have that continuous uh uh Blockbuster films you can't be called a superstar uh but I think animal what it did is it was the correct film at the right time uh to kind of just at least take another step up otherwise I've been kind of flatlined in the same status" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:15">[01:18:15]</a>

### Skills for the Film Industry
To succeed in movies, one needs:
*   **Patience:** Essential for a long career in the arts, not just seeking 15 minutes of fame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:29">[01:04:29]</a>.
*   **Sacrifice:** Giving up friendships, family life, or a certain lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:46">[01:04:46]</a>.
*   **Director:** Extremely selfless and giving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:02">[01:05:02]</a>.
*   **Producer:** A "people person" who can bring 200 people together and inspire belief in a project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>.
*   **Actor:** Childlike imagination that doesn't run out or become cynical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:29">[01:05:29]</a>.

The speaker avoids seeking attention and is happy not being the most important person in the room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:54">[01:05:54]</a>. He believes "handsome is what handsome does," meaning good work, intention, and work ethic are what truly matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:36">[01:06:36]</a>. He doesn't take his job for granted, knowing both success and failure from his film family background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:04">[01:16:04]</a>. He remains balanced, not experiencing extreme highs or lows, always focusing on the next project if a film is successful, or trying harder if it fails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>.

## Personal Life and Relationships

### Family Dynamics and Influences
He shared a room with his sister, who is two years older, until he was 13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:50">[01:18:50]</a>. They would fight, but due to their respective further education and her subsequent marriage, they missed out on "good years of bonding" and are not as close as he would like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:15">[01:19:15]</a>.

His parents had frequent, loud fights during his childhood, which made him feel "scared" and "on the edge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:20">[01:13:20]</a>. When his sister left for studies, he felt responsible and his mother would often share her feelings with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:10">[01:14:10]</a>. His father, however, was not expressive, making it difficult to understand his perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:19">[01:14:19]</a>.

> "I think that generation of men are scared of vulnerability" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:31">[01:14:31]</a>

His father found it hard to express love, never holding his hand or hugging him in a comforting way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:41">[01:14:41]</a>. The speaker never saw his father's eye color growing up, always just saying "yes" out of fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:55">[01:12:55]</a>. Despite this, he knew his father loved and cared for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:52">[01:14:52]</a>. He believes the movies of that era, and India's culture at the time, subconsciously influenced men to be less vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:05">[01:15:05]</a>.

### Love, Marriage, and Fatherhood
He believes in "one woman forever" in a romantic relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:18">[01:55:18]</a>. He considers himself lucky to have married his best friend, Alia, with whom he can chat and laugh endlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:02">[01:56:02]</a>. He first met Alia when she was 9 and he was 20, during a photoshoot for a film his director wanted to make <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:32">[01:56:32]</a>. He has immense respect for her as an actor, artist, and person, and she makes him smile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:09">[01:57:09]</a>. Alia is very ambitious, passionate, and intelligent in her work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:32">[01:57:32]</a>. She has made efforts to change certain behaviors, like speaking in a loud tone, which was difficult given his childhood experiences with his father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:11">[01:58:11]</a>.

He and Alia started dating in 2018 during a film project and began living together from the first year, which solidified their relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:12">[01:59:12]</a>. The COVID-19 lockdown was a good time for them, as they were healthy, trained, and learned new games together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:48">[01:59:48]</a>. Alia was also very supportive during his father's illness and treatment in New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:18">[01:00:18]</a>. He emphasizes that a partner's relationship with one's family is a "game changer," as seeing an outsider love your family the way you do is significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:39">[01:00:39]</a>. His mother and Alia have a very honest and good relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:11">[01:01:11]</a>.

The birth of his daughter, Raha, was his top high point in life, an indescribable feeling like having his heart in his hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:08">[01:17:08]</a>. He believes his daughter sees Alia as an extension of herself, but with him, she looks for fun and laughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:36">[01:17:36]</a>. Fatherhood has also made him question his long-held [[philosophy_on_life_and_personal_growth | philosophy of detachment]] and indifference, as he now fears death and wants to live longer for his daughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:32">[01:20:32]</a>. He will not do anything to hurt Alia or his daughter, as he believes in being faithful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:38">[01:55:38]</a>.

## Reflections on Life, Success, and Challenges

### Detachment and Vulnerability
He identifies as an "avoidant attached" person, having developed a sense of detachment from a young age after feeling pain when a friend left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:54">[01:19:54]</a>. This emotional detachment led him to stop crying very early in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:37">[01:33:37]</a>. He recalls not crying when his father passed away, experiencing a panic attack instead, and feeling that he still hasn't truly grieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:46">[01:33:46]</a>. He feels guilt for not having the "grace to let go of the distance" and hug his father when he showed vulnerability during his cancer treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:31">[01:34:31]</a>. Being the sole male child in the house after his sister left, he felt responsible and couldn't show weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:08">[01:35:08]</a>.

He tried therapy before his father got sick but felt he couldn't be completely honest or connect with the therapist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:30">[01:35:30]</a>. He also felt the therapist was teaching him to "manipulate life" to avoid stress, which he didn't want to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:44">[01:35:44]</a>. He has nothing against therapy but finds it hard to open himself up due to his fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:39">[01:36:39]</a>.

### On God and Spirituality
He grew up in a very pious household where his father performed two pujas daily and celebrated every festival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:28">[01:43:28]</a>. The speaker has a "good feeling about God" and believes his "manifestation power is very strong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:10">[01:44:10]</a>. He stopped asking God for things at a young age, wanting to save it for a "rainy day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:22">[01:44:22]</a>. His relationship with God is now one of gratitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:57">[01:44:57]</a>.

He has been reading a lot about Sanatana Dharma in recent years, finding it provides a "good system" and "good values" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:09">[01:45:09]</a>. He feels connected and good about himself when performing puja or chanting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:51">[01:45:51]</a>. While he believes in God, he struggles with the hypocrisy he sees in organized religion, particularly the preferential treatment given to those who can pay more in temples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:25">[01:46:25]</a>. He agrees with the idea that "whatever is higher in your list of beliefs in that hierarchy is your god" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:05">[01:47:05]</a>.

### Insecurity and Validation
The speaker admits to a "very pessimistic persona," re-hashing his flaws more than his strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:54">[01:22:54]</a>. He finds that moments of failure are significantly more vivid in his memory than successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:13">[01:23:13]</a>. While this is conducive to growth, he questions if it's healthy for overall mental well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:26">[01:23:26]</a>. He no longer feels insecure about his work, attributing it to arrogance, self-confidence, or his current life stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:33">[01:36:33]</a>. He also doesn't feel insecure about his wife romancing others on screen, having "grown up" and understood life better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:04">[01:37:04]</a>.

## Personal Philosophy and Outlook

### Growth and Identity
The speaker wears a tattoo that says "be here now," a philosophy from Ram Dass's book, reminding him to live in the present and not procrastinate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:36">[01:23:36]</a>. He also embodies a [[philosophy_on_life_and_personal_growth | philosophy on life and personal growth]] by J. Krishnamurti: "I don't mind what happens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:03">[01:25:03]</a>. He embraces sadness and happiness, letting himself experience emotions without questioning them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:10">[01:25:10]</a>. He acknowledges that he lives a life of contradiction, especially in marriage, where one must "let go of your personality" and adjust to make it livable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:38">[01:25:38]</a>.

### Future and Aspirations
The speaker is not interested in politics, feeling he's a "rebel without a cause" and wouldn't be happy working within a rigid structure or having to speak a pre-approved narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:15">[01:02:15]</a>. He likes his current life and doesn't see himself as "badass" enough to be a politician <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:10">[01:03:10]</a>. He prefers the world of being an artist, focusing on creation and aspiring to "die trying creating things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:28">[01:03:28]</a>. He realized producing isn't his skill set after a film he produced failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:39">[01:03:39]</a>.

He intends to continue working in the film industry, focusing on honest, good, and original work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:49">[01:27:49]</a>. He acknowledges that the acting profession demands everything, often at the cost of [[balancing_personal_and_professional_life | personal relationships]], as seen with actors like Aamir Khan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:40">[01:28:40]</a>. His current endeavor is to "balance real life with real life and not get swayed by just ambition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:51">[01:28:51]</a>.

His current chapter of life is "what next," indicating a desire to achieve more and spread his wings wider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:06">[01:31:06]</a>. He is transitioning from a stock market-heavy role to a longer-term investor role, enjoying investing in new industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:26">[01:31:26]</a>. He finds that learning new things "alleviates anxiety and validates" him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:38">[01:32:38]</a>.

### Investments and Consumerism
He does not believe in investing in residential real estate due to low rental yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:29">[01:33:29]</a>. He prefers renting and focuses his money on holidays and travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:15">[01:33:15]</a>. He owns nice cars but nothing flashy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:03">[01:34:03]</a>. He's passionate about Indian art, particularly Souza, and advocates for supporting local Indian brands that offer superior craftsmanship and quality compared to foreign luxury brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:01">[01:42:01]</a>. He believes switching to local brands can help build the domestic ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:08">[01:43:08]</a>.

### Health and Well-being
His top health hack is sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:48">[01:43:48]</a>. He also actively takes Omega-3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:39">[01:43:39]</a>. He has a structured daily routine that includes working out and meetings, emphasizing that his day doesn't feel long despite being packed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:06">[01:44:06]</a>. He trains three hours a day with a Korean trainer, focusing on mobility, stretching, cardio, and bodyweight exercises like pull-ups, squats, and deadlifts, moving away from machines and weights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:09">[01:45:09]</a>. This intensive training is for a challenging new role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:05">[01:46:05]</a>.

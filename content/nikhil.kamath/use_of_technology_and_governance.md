The intersection of technology and governance has brought about significant transformations in India, shaping how the government functions and interacts with its citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This includes leveraging tools like [[using_ai_and_technology_platforms | Artificial Intelligence]] and understanding concepts like [[the_role_of_technology_in_the_metaverse | the Meta Verse]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

## Evolution of Governance with Technology

The political landscape has seen a shift from a pre-social media era to one where digital platforms play a crucial role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:02">[00:38:02]</a>. For politicians, navigating this new environment requires adapting to public scrutiny and utilizing the power of digital tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:28">[00:38:28]</a>. The ability to verify information instantly through mobile phones and alternative paths available via social media has empowered citizens, strengthening democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:33">[00:41:33]</a>. This represents a significant shift in the [[technology_and_politics_interaction | interaction between technology and politics]] and the [[impact_of_digital_technology_on_people | impact of digital technology on people]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>.

Aspirational India, driven by technology, means addressing and solving every problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:17">[01:58:17]</a>. The goal is 100% toilet access, 100% electricity, and 100% tap water, alongside ensuring 100% conscious citizens who receive 100% benefits without discrimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:30">[01:58:30]</a>.

## Core Principles of Governance

The government's approach is encapsulated in the motto "Minimum Government, Maximum Governance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:14">[01:29:14]</a>. This philosophy is not about reducing the number of ministers or government employees, but rather about streamlining processes and removing unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. For instance, approximately 400 compliances have been removed, and around 1500 burdensome laws, many of which had criminal implications, have been changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:31">[01:30:31]</a>. This focus on efficiency and ease of compliance is a key aspect of modern governance.

## Direct Impact through Digital Public Infrastructure

India has set a global example in democratizing technology, particularly through initiatives like the India Stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:27">[01:32:27]</a>. The concept of Aadhaar (a unique identification number) and UPI (Unified Payments Interface) has revolutionized direct beneficiary transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:31">[01:31:31]</a>. For example, subsidies for crores of farmers and gas cylinder consumers can now be directly transferred to their accounts within 30 seconds with a single click <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:37">[01:31:37]</a>. This has significantly reduced leakage and corruption, showcasing the immense power of [[digital_public_infrastructure_and_its_globalization | Digital Public Infrastructure and its globalization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

The widespread availability of mobile phones has made the world accessible to the youth, fostering a new generation that is more informed and engaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:37">[01:32:37]</a>. The government has also established an innovation commission and a dedicated fund to encourage risk-taking among young entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:56">[01:32:56]</a>.

## Learning and Vision for the Future

The success of missions like Chandrayaan has ignited a new spirit among the youth, who are now more aware of complex scientific endeavors like Gaganyaan's timetable and astronaut training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:07]</a>. This demonstrates the powerful role of social media in educating and engaging the younger generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:35">[00:43:35]</a>.

A long-term vision involves preparing leaders for the next 20-30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:10">[02:00:10]</a>. This includes encouraging women's leadership in local governance bodies, with upcoming 30% reservation for women in MLA and MP roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:22">[02:02:22]</a>. The appeal is for the youth to enter public life, not just through elections, but through creative leadership that addresses societal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:57">[02:03:57]</a>. The goal is to bring new perspectives and a "new flow" into politics across all parties, fostering a new era of progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:31">[02:05:31]</a>.

For a youth considering [[political_aspirations_and_involvement | political aspirations]], it is suggested that they must possess a certain talent that can be evaluated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The idea is that good individuals should continue to enter politics, driven by a mission rather than mere ambition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## [[perceptions_of_political_engagement | Perceptions of Political Engagement]]

A significant challenge for youth engagement in politics is the deeply ingrained [[public_perception_of_politics | public perception of politics]] that "politics is a dirty place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This view, often communicated since childhood within families, particularly in a South Indian middle-class context, has become so ingrained in the collective psyche that it is considered "very difficult to change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

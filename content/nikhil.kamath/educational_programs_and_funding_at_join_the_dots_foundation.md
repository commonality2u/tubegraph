[[join_the_dots_foundation_overview_and_mission | Join The Dots Foundation]], founded by Danay Ramakrishna (DJ), operates in the rural areas of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, focusing on educational and holistic development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The foundation started in 2014 with DJ's initial goal of supporting a few students, which expanded upon realizing the immense, untapped potential in rural schools after visiting 17 schools from Bangalore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Funding and Allocation

[[join_the_dots_foundation_overview_and_mission | Join The Dots Foundation]] received a significant fund of 1 Crore rupees from Episode 9 of "the venture capitalist" podcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. These funds are being utilized across various initiatives to support educational and community development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The organization publicly acknowledges its benefactors, including Nikhil Kamath and WTFund, for their contributions to infrastructure and programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, even displaying banners to thank them for their charity and donation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

## Mission and Vision

The core mission of [[join_the_dots_foundation_overview_and_mission | Join The Dots Foundation]] is to ensure "every student must become the best version of themselves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Their ambitious vision is to impact 10,000 students by the end of 2031, aiming for them to achieve high earning potential (50 LPA), contribute 2% back to the foundation and community, and dedicate 10 hours of their time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Key Educational Programs and Initiatives

### Software Development Training

[[join_the_dots_foundation_overview_and_mission | Join The Dots Foundation]] has a rigorous program to identify and train resilient students to become software developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. Six girls were selected from 34 schools after a three-month testing period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. For the past year, these 16-year-old students have learned data structures, algorithms, HTML, and CSS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. After finishing 12th grade, they will live in a two-bedroom apartment with an office-like setup for three years, attending college and then returning to learn full-stack web development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. The foundation encourages them to develop strong startup ideas for potential funding from figures like Nikhil Kamath, who supports Indian companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

Cricket matches between India and New Zealand are a notable aspect of [[new_zealand_and_india_relations_in_sports | sports connections]] between the two countries. One such event, the India New Zealand cricket final, was humorously referenced by a podcast guest who had recently attended the match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:44">[01:28:44]</a>. The guest light-heartedly remarked that the podcast was "going so well until you had to go mention that," implying a memorable, possibly unfavorable, outcome for their team in the final <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:44">[01:34:44]</a>.

## Overview of Consumption Trends in India
An investment fund has been established specifically for companies in the consumption sector in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Despite positive reported top-line numbers, on-the-ground observations suggest a decline in consumption over the past two to three months across various segments, including travel, fashion, and e-commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This drop is unexpected, especially in a year leading up to an election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

As an investor, the broader Indian market presents significant opportunities within consumption, yet there are few independent Indian brands that have scaled significantly in this space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### Factors Influencing Recent Consumption Shifts
Several factors contribute to the observed changes in consumption:
*   **Festival Calendar Shift** Diwali being a month later than usual in 2023, coupled with marketers following calendar months instead of festival calendars, can cause a mismatch in reported numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>.
*   **Inflation** Inflation is identified as a contributing factor to the consumption drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:33">[00:47:33]</a>.
*   **Rising Interest Rates** Interest rates may be high enough to significantly impact consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>.
*   **Post-COVID Fatigue** After an initial surge in consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic, a fatigue factor may have set in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:52">[00:48:52]</a>.
*   **Formalization of the Economy** The increasing formalization of the Indian economy, which comes with higher costs, including an 18% GST component, is believed to be a significant hit for consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:04">[00:49:04]</a>. The formalization is considered almost complete, with few leakages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">[00:49:40]</a>.
*   **Shift in Consumer Spending** Consumers are reallocating their budgets towards new interests and experiences, such as mobile phones, travel, eating out, and live shows/concerts, which are growing rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:22">[00:50:22]</a>. For example, spending is shifting towards healthier eating options like peanut butter, where growth is not slowing down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:33">[00:51:33]</a>.

## Market Trends in Fashion and Beauty in India

### Market Structure and Penetration
India's market, particularly in fashion, beauty, and home decor, remains largely unbranded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   **Fashion E-commerce Penetration:** In India, e-commerce penetration in fashion is around 10-11% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:49">[00:40:49]</a>. This is significantly lower compared to China (mid-20s%) and the US (17-18%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:44">[01:12:44]</a>.
*   **Unorganized Sector:** Approximately 60% of the fashion market in India is still unorganized, particularly in ready-to-stitch and ethnic wear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>. The shift from unorganized to branded is occurring, with branded segments growing 2-3x faster than the overall market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.
*   **Long-term Growth:** This penetration is expected to continue to rise cyclically over the next 5-10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:37">[01:13:37]</a>. While the current situation may show slowdowns, the 3-4 year view indicates reasonably fast growth for online platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:09">[01:13:09]</a>.

### Geographic and Demographic Insights
[[consumer_behavior_and_market_trends_in_india | Consumer Behavior and Market Trends in India]] show distinct consumption patterns:
*   **Top Households:** Around 30 million (3 crore) households contribute to 60% of India's consumption, particularly in "value-added consumption" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:42">[00:52:42]</a>.
*   **India 1 (Premium Consumers):** This segment, estimated at 100-120 million people (assuming 4 people per family), represents India's high-spending demographic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:50">[00:56:50]</a>.
    *   They are characterized by having domestic help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:04">[00:54:04]</a>.
    *   Their consumption is increasing, driven by both volume and premiumization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>.
    *   They are highly aware of product ingredients and ethical considerations like cruelty-free and paraben-free products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:19">[02:06:19]</a>.
    *   They mostly reside in the top 100 cities, with 60%+ in metros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:19">[01:11:19]</a>.
    *   They consume a significantly higher number of items (approx. 100,000 in a lifetime) compared to other segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>.
    *   They are 100% online, with UPI being a more likely payment method than credit cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.
    *   They account for 70% of packaged goods, 85% of beauty, and 78% of eating out consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:47">[00:59:47]</a>.
    *   Their household income is generally above 30-40 lakhs, with a "Singapore" sub-segment earning 60 lakhs+ (closer to 90 lakhs-1 crore) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:07">[00:59:07]</a>.
*   **India 2 (Middle Class):** Consists of service providers like drivers, helpers, maids, and watchmen. This segment is growing as people from India 3 migrate to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. They consume around 10,000 items in their lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:23">[01:15:23]</a>.
*   **India 3 (Farm Laborers):** They rely on government aid and consume basic necessities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:21">[00:54:21]</a>. They consume approximately 1,000 items in their lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:27">[01:15:27]</a>.

## High Gross Margins in Fashion and Beauty
Fashion and beauty are high-gross-margin categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:28">[01:13:28]</a>.
*   Fashion typically sees 50-60% gross margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:32">[01:13:32]</a>.
*   Beauty can have even higher margins, ranging from 70-80% depending on the specific area (e.g., perfumes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:37">[01:13:37]</a>.

### Core Principles for New Brands (0 to 20 Crores Revenue)
*   **Product-Driven & Word-of-Mouth:** Brands in this initial phase should be driven by excellent product quality, strong word-of-mouth, and community engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:18">[01:25:18]</a>.
*   **Content & Community:** [[building_a_brand_in_fashion_beauty_or_home | Brand building]] should be heavily content and community-driven, rather than relying on performance marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:21">[01:25:21]</a>. This requires great reviews, high repeat rates, and active social media following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:28">[01:25:28]</a>.
*   **Distribution Strategy:** A good mix for initial distribution is 80% through e-commerce platforms (like Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra) and 20% through Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:55">[01:25:55]</a>. While marketplaces can be challenging for brand representation, they offer significant reach and consumer data for product-market fit validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on Niche:** It is crucial for new brands to focus on a niche and become a "shark in a pond" rather than a small fish in a large sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:19">[01:36:19]</a>. This allows for meaningful differentiation in the early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:26">[01:36:26]</a>.

### Scaling Strategies (20 to 100 Crores Revenue)
*   **Efficient Performance Marketing:** This phase demands highly efficient performance marketing and leveraging community for organic brand building to reduce reliance on paid advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:37">[01:36:37]</a>.
*   **Growth Hacking:** Understanding and applying growth hacking techniques specific to platforms (e.g., Amazon, Myntra, Google, Facebook) is a core skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:48">[01:37:48]</a>.
    *   **Platform-Specific Optimization:** Platforms like Myntra value freshness (new styles, frequent drops), while Amazon prioritizes consumer reviews and ratings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:42">[01:39:42]</a>.
    *   **Underpriced Attention:** Finding where the ideal customer spends time and where attention is "underpriced" (e.g., niche online communities, dating apps for a pizza company example) can lead to effective and unconventional marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:51">[01:48:51]</a>.
*   **Product Differentiation:** Continued focus on unique selling propositions, whether in sourcing, design, or specialized capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:50">[01:50:50]</a>.
*   **Inventory Management:** Online platforms generally value "width" (more SKUs) over "depth" (more units of fewer SKUs) due to unlimited shelf space and algorithmic preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:08">[02:18:08]</a>. Quick turnarounds and a flexible manufacturing backend are critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:17">[02:19:17]</a>.

### Scaling Beyond 100 Crores
*   **Offline Expansion:** To scale beyond 100 crores in revenue, brands typically need to integrate offline presence, which requires a different skill set from digital-first operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:04">[02:05:04]</a>.
*   **Shift to "Pull" Demand:** The goal is to transition from "push" (performance marketing) to "pull" (organic sales) demand, with performance-based sales ideally reducing to 30-40% of overall sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:06">[02:06:06]</a>.

### Role of Technology and Data
*   **Data-Driven Product Development:** Using search data from platforms like Google, Amazon, and Flipkart can reveal "null sets" (what people are searching for but not finding), guiding new product launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:34">[01:31:34]</a>.
*   **AI/ML in Operations:** [[impact_of_technology_and_future_trends_in_commerce | Data science and machine learning]] are crucial for business operations:
    *   **Demand Forecasting:** Algorithms can cluster similar products to use historical data for better prediction of new product sales, improving forecast accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:16">[02:21:16]</a>.
    *   **Dynamic Pricing:** Pricing can be converted into a science, using algorithms to determine optimal pricing based on inventory levels and volume-price elasticity curves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.
    *   **Reducing Waste:** Machine learning can significantly reduce inventory and wastage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:17">[02:23:17]</a>.
    *   **Cataloging:** Generative AI can speed up product cataloging, offering a sustainable advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:12">[02:19:12]</a>.

### [[building_a_brand_in_fashion_beauty_or_home | Brand Building]] through Storytelling
*   **Name and Logo:** The brand name and logo are incredibly valuable and can be a common reason for brand failure if not chosen correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:18">[03:17:18]</a>.
*   **Stories over Facts:** People remember stories, not just facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:02">[03:03:02]</a>. A brand name should have a story associated with it, even if it's initially a "germ of an idea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:05">[03:03:05]</a>.
*   **Origin Stories:** For food products, an origin story (e.g., "Brazilian raspberries") can significantly boost sales, even at a higher price point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:10">[03:59:10]</a>.
*   **Playing on Ego and Vanity:** All brands, from mass to luxury, appeal to an ideal image or aspiration, suggesting who the consumer can become <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:07">[03:06:07]</a>.
*   **"Greed, Fear, and Altruism":** Brands can be built on these principles: greed (lower price), fear (limited availability), and altruism (supporting a cause) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.

### Celebrity and Influencer-Led Brands
*   **Authenticity is Key:** For [[marketing_strategies_in_the_craft_beverage_space | influencer marketing]] to work, authenticity is crucial, especially for Gen Z audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:01">[03:32:01]</a>. Influencers should disclose sponsored content, as a lack of transparency can lead to backlash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:25">[03:32:25]</a>.
*   **Consistency:** Celebrities or influencers should have a consistent narrative or set of values that align with the brand over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:07">[03:33:07]</a>.
*   **Tipping Point Influencers:** Partnering with influencers who are on a "tipping point" (growing rapidly but not yet at their peak) allows the brand to grow alongside their influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:05">[03:49:05]</a>.
*   **Equity over Cash:** New brands should offer equity to influencers rather than upfront cash, ensuring their commitment to the brand's long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:25">[03:52:25]</a>.
*   **Community-Led Marketing:** Moving beyond individual influencers, building a brand through community (e.g., Facebook groups, fan pages) fosters organic growth and evangelism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:32">[03:17:32]</a>.
*   **"Function, Emotion, and Community":** Modern brands need to combine strong product functionality, emotional appeal, and an engaged community to succeed and scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:21">[03:30:21]</a>.

## Emerging Opportunities and Challenges

### Promising Categories
*   **Health and Wellness:** Beyond niche categories like peanut butter, [[entrepreneurial_opportunities_in_health_and_wellness | health and wellness]] is a growing area for consumption due to shifting consumer preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:07">[00:51:07]</a>.
*   **Pets:** The pet accessories and grooming market is seen as a high-gross-margin category with significant growth potential, driven by demographics like "double income, no kids with a dog" (DINKWAD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:11">[03:08:11]</a>.
*   **Athleisure:** Despite existing big players, there's ample space for new athleisure brands, especially those that focus on Indian body types and leverage widely available fabric technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:33">[03:08:33]</a>.
*   **Men's Beauty:** A new category opportunity, as men are increasingly concerned with their appearance. Brands can focus on functional solutions to common problems (e.g., "under-eye solution" instead of "concealer") and leverage micro-influencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:29">[03:12:29]</a>.
*   **Seniors/Elderly:** This demographic is identified as a new consumer group with disposable income, seeking to enjoy life rather than pass on wealth, creating opportunities for tailored products and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:16">[03:16:16]</a>.
*   **Household Goods:** Categories like cutlery and crockery offer opportunities for new designs and sensibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:03">[03:07:03]</a>.

### Platform Dynamics and Investment
*   **E-commerce Platforms:** Platforms like Myntra, Nykaa, and Amazon continue to thrive by aggregating traffic and building distinct brand identities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:27">[03:02:27]</a>.
*   **ONDCP (Open Network for Digital Commerce):** ONDC is not seen as a direct threat to existing platforms but rather as a tool to empower smaller brands by providing direct access and potentially driving down platform margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:14">[03:04:14]</a>.
*   **Valuation for Platforms:** For investors, valuing platforms means looking at future cash flows and the market share percentage at which they can generate substantial profit, rather than just current cash flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:55">[03:04:55]</a>.
*   **Platform Models:** There are two main models:
    *   **Pure Play Marketplace:** Connects buyers and sellers, with inventory and shipping handled by the brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:46">[03:05:46]</a>.
    *   **Fulfilled by Platform:** Inventory is stored in the platform's warehouse, offering faster delivery and potentially lower costs for bulky items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:59">[03:05:59]</a>. The choice depends on volume and value of products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:14">[03:06:14]</a>.

### [[challenges_for_new_brands_in_quick_commerce | Challenges for New Brands in Quick Commerce]]
*   **Returns and Fakes:** High return rates in fashion (30%+) can significantly impact economics due to reverse logistics and inventory tie-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:44">[02:28:44]</a>. The issue of fake products online is complex, partly due to returns of different items by customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:43">[02:26:43]</a>. Brands, especially new ones, should focus on getting product fit right and clearly communicating it to reduce returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:04">[02:29:04]</a>.
*   **Competition from Large Players:** Directly competing with established FMCG giants (like Unilever, P&G) in large, organized categories is not advisable for new brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:16">[02:16:16]</a>. These giants have significant resources, distribution, and a tendency to suppress new entrants or acquire successful ones at a premium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:19">[02:17:19]</a>. However, their digital capabilities have improved significantly in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:53">[02:13:53]</a>.
*   **Physical Touch & Feel:** For certain categories like shoes, the need for physical touch and feel remains a barrier for online sales, particularly for high-value items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:41">[02:23:41]</a>. While technology (e.g., size finders) can address some aspects, the full sensory experience is not yet replicable online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:20">[02:24:20]</a>.

## Key Takeaways for New Brands (0 to 1)
*   **Prioritize Product Quality:** Do not compromise on product quality for speed of launch, as shortcuts can have long-lasting negative consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:58">[03:17:58]</a>.
*   **Thorough Checklist:** Maintain a monthly checklist of hygiene details (e.g., correct tax categorization on platforms) to avoid costly mistakes, especially for lean, individual teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:04">[03:19:04]</a>.
*   **Continuous Learning:** Continuously learn and adapt, whether through market observation (e.g., standing in supermarkets), data analysis, or talking to industry experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:01">[02:56:01]</a>.
*   **Focus on Differentiation:** Identify a unique strength (sourcing, content/community, design, growth hacking) to differentiate the brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:27">[01:45:27]</a>.
*   **Addition vs. Replacement:** It is often easier to build an "addition" category (a new product consumers don't currently have) than a "replacement" category (trying to substitute an existing product) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:08">[03:50:08]</a>.
*   **Transparency:** Be transparent about advertising and product claims, especially with younger, discerning consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:01">[03:32:01]</a>.
*   **Authenticity:** For celebrity endorsements, focus on those whose personality and beliefs align with the brand's values, rather than just their popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:39">[03:37:39]</a>.

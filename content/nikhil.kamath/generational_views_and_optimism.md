A noticeable difference in optimism is observed in [[challenges_and_mindset_of_the_modern_youth | generations born beyond 1995 or 2000]], who are perceived to lack the same level of optimism as older generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Call to Action for Engagement

To address this perceived lack of optimism, there is a request for these younger generations to "get involved" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. The advice suggests that instead of remaining on the sidelines, commenting, or sounding off behind a keyboard, individuals should actively "get into the arena and actually give it a go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

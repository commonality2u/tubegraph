This article aims to clarify the pragmatic nature of starting and running a company, focusing on different funding mechanisms available to entrepreneurs in India. The discussion seeks to provide insights for anyone looking to launch a company in the coming years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Categories of Investment

The investment landscape for startups and growing businesses can be broadly categorized into three main types: [[risktaking_in_starting_a_venture | Angel Investing]], [[venture_capital | Venture Capital]], and Private Equity (PE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>.

### Angel Investing

Angel investors utilize their own personal capital to fund very early-stage companies, typically pre-launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:48">[00:38:48]</a>.
They are responsible only to themselves, unlike institutional funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a>. In the U.S., there were 300,000 registered angels as of 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:04">[00:45:04]</a>.

*   **Investment Quantum**: Angel investments can range from a few thousand rupees to one or two crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:46">[00:39:46]</a>.
*   **Risk and Returns**: A significant majority, about 90%, of angel investors perform poorly or lose money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:34">[00:40:34]</a>. Returns are generally mediocre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>. It is advised that if the objective is to make returns, one should not be an angel investor unless they are deeply networked, understand the specific sector, and can add tremendous value beyond just capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:52">[00:41:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:21">[00:42:21]</a>.
*   **Role in Ecosystem**: Angels are crucial for the ecosystem as they take risks that institutions cannot, supporting companies when friends and family money runs out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:30">[00:44:30]</a>.
*   **Market Size in India**: There are an estimated 6,000 to 25,000 active angel investors in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>.

### Venture Capital (VC)

[[venture_capital | Venture Capital]] involves institutional capital managed by organized firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:35">[00:45:35]</a>.

*   **Fund Size**: Fund sizes vary significantly, from micro VCs with as little as five to ten million dollars (100 crores) to large funds with 25,000-50,000 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>. The largest fund ever raised globally was SoftBank's Vision Fund at $100 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:02">[00:48:02]</a>.
*   **Investment Stages**: VCs invest at various stages, from seed funding (e.g., two to three crores to get a company off the ground) up to a company achieving profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:27">[00:48:27]</a>. This includes seed, Series A, Series B, and so on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:30">[00:48:30]</a>.
*   **Examples of Firms in India**: Prominent VC firms in India include Accel, Peak XV (formerly Sequoia Capital India), Lightspeed, Nexus, Elevation, Blume, Chiratae, Kalaari, and Matrix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>.
*   **Fee Structure and Life Cycle**:
    *   Most VC firms have a 10-year fund life with an option for a two-to-three-year extension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:27">[00:49:27]</a>.
    *   Management fees are typically 2% of the funds raised annually, used to cover team salaries and operational costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:44">[00:49:44]</a>.
    *   "Carry" is the percentage of gains (usually 20%) that fund managers keep, but this is only distributed after the fund returns all invested capital and fees, plus often a threshold Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 8-10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:07">[00:51:07]</a>. This ensures incentives are aligned with entrepreneurs' long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:03">[00:52:03]</a>.
*   **Returns and Performance**:
    *   International investors expect VCs to deliver 25% compounded returns, currency-adjusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
    *   The "power law" of returns in [[venture_capital | Venture Capital]] dictates that 2-3% (or less than 5%) of a portfolio will generate 80% of the returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>. Another 20-30% might yield a 5x return over 10-11 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>.
    *   Exits are achieved through a company going public (IPO), a strategic sale (e.g., to Google), or a later-stage fund buying out the VC's stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:05">[00:50:05]</a>.
*   **Dry Powder**: This refers to committed but uncalled capital, which is not held by the VC firm but called for as needed to avoid negatively impacting IRR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:27">[00:52:27]</a>.
*   **Limited Partner (LP) Sources**: For larger VC funds, 90-100% of capital comes from institutions like endowments and sovereign funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:14">[00:53:14]</a>. Some smaller or more domestically focused funds might have a 50/50 split with family offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:24">[00:53:24]</a>.
*   **Taxation**: Generally, there is no tax arbitrage for foreign money investing in India; everybody pays the same taxes, except for certain sovereign funds with double tax treaties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:57">[00:37:57]</a>.

### Private Equity (PE)

Private Equity funds invest in established, mature companies that are already generating profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:44">[00:48:44]</a>. The term "PE" sometimes broadly covers the entire asset class, including venture capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:34">[00:56:34]</a>.

*   **Investment Focus**: PE funds prefer to invest closer to a visible IPO event or other exit within two to three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:50">[00:56:50]</a>. They expect a higher maturity of the business model and product-market fit compared to VCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:11">[00:57:11]</a>.
*   **Scale**: The total Assets Under Management (AUM) for PE in India is approximately $200 billion, with 85% being foreign capital and 15% domestic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:37">[00:57:37]</a>.
*   **Returns**: The PE industry has been around longer and has been more consistent in its returns than VC over the last decade, partly due to investing in multiple sectors beyond just tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:52">[00:57:52]</a>.
*   **Examples of Firms**: Notable PE firms in India include WestBridge Capital and globally recognized names like KKR and Warburg Pincus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:16">[00:59:16]</a>.

## Regulatory Classifications: Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs)

In India, the government regulated investment funds through Alternative Investment Fund (AIF) regulations, revised in 2012 to categorize funds based on risk profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:50">[00:46:50]</a>.

*   **Category I (Cat I)**: Funds that cannot invest in certain securities like debt or public markets. VCs typically fall under this category if they only do equity investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:09">[00:47:09]</a>.
*   **Category II (Cat II)**: Funds that have more flexibility and can invest in a broader range of securities, including some debt and public markets. Private equity funds often fall here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:14">[00:47:14]</a>.
*   **Category III (Cat III)**: Primarily focused on public markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:16">[00:47:16]</a>.

| **Role**           | First money in, high-risk appetite                    | Scale innovation, fund growth, support multiple rounds   | Maximize value in mature businesses, prepare for large exits |

### IPOs and Secondary Capital

Historically, IPOs provided primary capital to companies for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:52">[02:09:52]</a>. However, in recent years, many VC-funded companies' IPOs have focused on Offer For Sale (OFS), where existing investors (VCs) sell their shares, allowing them to exit and realize returns, rather than the company raising new capital for operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:55">[02:09:55]</a>. This has led to concerns about misaligned interests and overpriced listings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:32">[02:10:32]</a>. The market is now shifting towards more appropriate pricing and potentially capping the secondary component of issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:29">[02:13:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:35">[02:13:35]</a>.

### SPACs (Special Purpose Acquisition Companies)

SPACs are companies formed to raise capital through an IPO with the sole purpose of acquiring an existing private company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:15">[02:08:15]</a>. The financing comes before knowing what they will buy, giving significant power to the manager to identify assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:31">[02:08:31]</a>. However, many SPACs have shut down, often due to misalignment of interest and the acquisition of "bad assets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:47">[02:08:47]</a>.

### Market Dynamics

Public markets generally lead private markets in terms of valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:51">[02:14:51]</a>. A tough market for fundraising (like 2023, where only two companies raised over $40-50 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:24">[02:15:24]</a>) often signifies a time for "cleanups and stability" in the VC world, as companies focus on profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:30">[02:15:30]</a>.

In India, [[understanding_venture_capital_and_its_role_in_indias_startup_ecosystem | the venture capital ecosystem]] is still relatively young, with entrepreneurs learning to build, scale, and IPO, which contributes to why fund returns might be lower compared to more mature markets like the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:56">[02:08:56]</a>.

## Prajakta Koli: From Radio to Global Influence

Prajakta Koli, a content creator and actor from Mumbai, India, began her [[content_creation_and_monetization_strategies | content creation journey]] in 2015 after a disappointing experience as a radio jockey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. She met Sudeep from One Digital, who suggested she start a YouTube channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. Without any clear plan or idea of where it would lead, she began creating videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

Her work ethic is highly regarded by her peers, who describe her as "hardworking and disciplined" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>. Her first video to "really, really blow up" was in July 2015, titled "Words Delhi Girls Use" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>. In 2019, she branched into acting, a transition she describes as unplanned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>. YouTube has been a significant supporter in her journey, especially through programs like "Creators for Change," which led to her involvement in a documentary with Michelle Obama for girls' education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>. This opened many doors, connecting her with initiatives like Goalkeepers and the UNDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>. Her future aspirations include more acting and writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>.

## Key Insights and Challenges in Content Creation

### The Creator Identity: Influencer vs. Creator
There's a strong sentiment against the term "influencer," with creators preferring "content creator."
> "Influencers are the fathers, the doctors, the mothers, the teachers, they influence children. We've done creating of content, we created content and it has impacted people but influencer is a term is like Mumbai by Bombay, influencer as a term is like slightly self-obsessed." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>

### Platform Hierarchy and Evolution
A perceived hierarchy exists among platforms, with YouTube often seen as "class one citizen," followed by Instagram, TikTok, and then Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>. This hierarchy often correlates with "screen profile," where larger screens (movies) historically held higher status, though digital platforms are increasingly challenging this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>.

Social media platforms constantly change their algorithms to grab eyeballs, which can surprise creators when old strategies stop working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:48:00">[18:48:00]</a>. Creators are grouped into "batches," requiring constant reinvention every few years to stay relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:28:00">[28:28:00]</a>.

### The Shelf Life of a Creator
The concept of a "seven-year chunk" in life, where changes occur in personal tastes and even cellular makeup, is applied to a creator's career lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:17:00">[20:17:00]</a>. Many creators anticipate a shelf life and plan an exit strategy into other ventures like entrepreneurship or acting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:37:00">[16:37:00]</a>.

### Dealing with Criticism and "Cancellation"
Pushback from the audience, or "cancellation," is viewed as a sign of relevance.
> "If you get cancelled or pushed back you have cracked it. Yes, you are finally relevant enough to hate it." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:00:00">[44:00:00]</a>
The ability to absorb feedback and improve content is crucial. Quantity of content can help show improvement over time and mitigate the impact of isolated criticisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:39:00">[44:39:00]</a>.

### Authenticity vs. Performance
Creators must navigate the balance between being authentic and presenting a curated persona. While genuine curiosity and personality naturally translate into content, a degree of performance is always present in public interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:13:00">[36:13:00]</a>. Complete authenticity can lead to trouble, as no one is "fully clean" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:37:00">[38:37:00]</a>.

### The Creator Economy and Monetization
The global creator economy is a massive industry, estimated at $250 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:04">[01:01:04]</a>. In India, brands spend an estimated 1,500-2,000 crores ($180-240 million USD) annually on social media influencers, a number growing rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:23">[01:02:23]</a>. However, the *revenue per user* (ARPU) in India is significantly lower than in markets like the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:22">[01:04:22]</a>.

To overcome the challenges of lower ARPU and brand dependency, creators are advised to build [[monetization_strategies_for_content_creators | community-based businesses]] by owning their audience's data (emails, phone numbers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. This allows direct product sales, like educational courses or experiences, which see high engagement in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:57">[01:05:57]</a>.

### Hacks for New Content Creators
*   **Start with Short-Form Content:** YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, and Facebook Reels (under 59 seconds) are the best way to gain initial reach and discoverability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:04">[01:11:04]</a>. This helps build confidence early in the [[building_influence_as_a_content_creator | content creation journey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>.
*   **Transition to Long-Form:** Once reach is established, create longer content (podcasts, YouTube videos) to build deeper community and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:04">[01:10:04]</a>.
*   **Leverage Unique Access:** Create content around what you know better than anyone else or unique experiences you have access to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:48">[01:20:48]</a>.
*   **Identify a Mission/End Goal:** Content with a clear end goal (e.g., "75 Hard," "traveling across America with one penny") keeps viewers engaged for the "reveal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:55">[01:52:55]</a>.
*   **Explore Regional Languages & Identities:** Speaking to regional identities or in native languages leads to higher engagement rates and can tap into underserved markets where content supply is low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:55">[01:56:55]</a>.
*   **Use [[technological_advancements_and_ai_in_content_creation | AI Tools]]:** ChatGPT for ideation and scriptwriting, and AI dubbing tools like HeyGen, are rapidly evolving to make content creation more accessible and global <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:57">[02:54:57]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Publishing over Perfection:** Don't be too shy to hit publish. Consistent output improves quality over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:27">[02:21:27]</a>.
*   **Collaborate:** Seek collaborations with creators at similar levels, or use "non-consensual collaboration" by featuring and talking about larger creators to get recommended to their audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:04">[02:10:04]</a>.
*   **Don't Overthink Production Quality (initially):** High-end equipment isn't necessary at the start. Phone footage often performs better on platforms like Instagram Reels due to relatability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:09">[02:21:09]</a>.
*   **Hire an Editor:** The first hire should be an editor to free up time for other aspects of content creation and business building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:42">[02:55:42]</a>. Share revenue with your team to build loyalty and ensure they are invested in the success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:23">[02:56:23]</a>.
*   **Treat it as a Job:** Maintain discipline and dedicate specific hours, even if it's spare time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:22">[02:23:22]</a>.
*   **Live an Interesting Life:** Instead of living to make videos, live an interesting life and then make videos about it, allowing your content to naturally evolve with your journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:39">[03:03:39]</a>.

### Beyond Content: The "And" Economy
Today, content creation is not just a standalone career but a complementary skill that can enhance any profession. This is termed the "and" economy, where one can be a doctor *and* a creator, or a lawyer *and* a creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:33">[02:26:33]</a>. It provides a way for professionals to find clients and build distribution organically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

### [[content_creation_for_money_vs_power | Money vs. Power]]: The Future of Content
In the Indian context, English content may yield more money (higher brand value, ARPU), while Hindi content offers more "power" through deeper connection and influence over a mass audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:40">[02:02:40]</a>.

The rise of independent creators is challenging traditional media. Influencers are increasingly generating more revenue and views than legacy media houses, leading to potential backlash and calls for regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. However, this decentralization of information is seen as a positive, reaching new generations and providing unfiltered perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.

Ultimately, creators are encouraged to build businesses under their distribution channels, as wealth is made through owning equity rather than just renting out time through branded content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:01">[02:39:01]</a>.

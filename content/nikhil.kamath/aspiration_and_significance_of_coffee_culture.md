Coffee is perceived as an "upwardly mobile aspirational beverage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This perspective highlights its role beyond just a drink, positioning it as a symbol of social and economic mobility.

## Evolving Expectations in Coffee Culture

The standard for coffee shops is continuously rising. For a 25-year-old, the expectation of having good coffee, good training, and even good food is becoming the "bare minimum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This indicates a growing sophistication in consumer tastes and a demand for higher quality experiences within coffee culture.

Attracting customers to a coffee shop remains a challenge, even for established businesses with numerous outlets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Market Dynamics: Starbucks in India

When questioned about Starbucks' performance in India, the answer is "yes and no, it's fine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This suggests a nuanced and perhaps competitive landscape for major coffee chains in the Indian market, implying that while they have a presence, success isn't unilaterally overwhelming.

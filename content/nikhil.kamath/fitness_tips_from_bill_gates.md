During an interview, it was observed that Bill Gates appeared "fitter" than previously remembered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. When asked if he had any "hack" to recommend to young entrepreneurs, his advice focused on leveraging technology, specifically suggesting to "pick some AI thing and just use use the Google Microsoft platforms and and go on top of that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

While a comment was made about his improved physical appearance, this specific transcript does not contain direct [[healthy_living_and_fitness | fitness tips]] or hacks offered by Bill Gates himself. The "hack" he provided was related to [[advice_for_young_entrepreneurs | entrepreneurship]] and [[Bill Gates on capitalism and AI | AI]] applications, not personal [[significance_of_fitness_and_health | health]] or [[entrepreneurship_and_wellness | wellness]] strategies.

Youth engagement in [[perspectives_on_entrepreneurship | entrepreneurship]] is a growing trend, with young individuals demonstrating remarkable success and adaptability. This section explores the journeys of young entrepreneurs, their motivations, challenges, and unique approaches to business.

## Early Beginnings and Inspiration
Many young entrepreneurs display an early inclination towards building and innovation. For instance, the founders of Zepto, Kaivalya and Adit, were exposed to engineering concepts early on by their fathers, both engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Kaivalya started programming at the age of 10 or 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. By age 17, they aimed to transform their hobby of building into a career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

Their inspiration came from resources like Y Combinator's Startup School, an online course on YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. This exposed them to the Silicon Valley community, where people build for a living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. They even applied to Stanford, viewing it as an "excuse" to get to Silicon Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

## Navigating Challenges: The Pandemic Pivot
The COVID-19 pandemic, specifically March 2020, significantly impacted their planned educational path to Stanford, leading them to take a year off college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. This unexpected break became an opportunity for experimentation. Living in Bombay, they observed the disruption in local grocery deliveries during lockdown, with online services taking up to 7-8 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

Their first venture involved delivering groceries for elderly neighbors via a WhatsApp group, initially without a fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This informal service grew until the WhatsApp group reached its 256-member limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. This led them to develop their first app, "Kiranacart," a pickup and drop service, which quickly scaled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. In the early days, they handled every role: customer support, delivery, and packing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

## Funding and Growth Strategies
For funding, they applied to Contrat Capital, a fellowship that provided $50,000 USD (approx. 40 lakhs INR) for free to young teams building something interesting during their gap year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. This initial investment came with a $2.5 million valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

A key challenge was the "chicken and egg problem" of marketplace businesses (attracting sellers and customers simultaneously) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. They focused on acquiring sellers, walking into kirana stores across Bombay neighborhoods for three months to convince them to join their platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. This experience, despite low success rates (10 out of 10 would dismiss them, 2 would download, 1 would delete by the time they left), served as an invaluable sales crash course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

Despite reaching 300 orders a day within 30-40 days of launching the app in early 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>, customer feedback indicated dissatisfaction with speed (45-60 minutes delivery) and overall experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. This led them to realize they had "induced product market fit" due to lockdown circumstances, not genuine customer satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.

This critical feedback prompted a pivot to the "dark store" model in July 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. Dark stores are micro-warehouses, similar to supermarkets but not customer-facing, allowing for faster order fulfillment and better quality control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. This model allowed them to grow from zero to over 5,000 crores in sales within 24 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.

Their growth was exponential, reaching 100-150% weekly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. This rapid expansion led to significant funding rounds, including a $10 million Series A from Nexus before July 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>, a $50 million Series B within 45 days of that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>, and a $100 million Series C led by Y Combinator's growth fund in December 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>. In total, they raised $530 million in 218 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>.

### Key Factors in Zepto's Success:
*   **Operating Excellence:** The founders emphasize "Six Sigma like culture," being left-brained, analytical, and disciplined, focusing on continuous improvement in cost structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>.
*   **Customer Experience:** Understanding that "good service does not mean premium or luxury" but is now "table stakes" for all consumers, including Gen Z <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:11">[00:57:11]</a>.
*   **Solving Real Problems:** Identifying a clear market gap (disrupted local kiranas, slow online delivery) and building a solution for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
*   **[[Entrepreneurial Traits | Adaptability]]:** Pivoting from a marketplace model to dark stores based on customer feedback and market realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.

## Entrepreneurship in Diverse Fields
[[Entrepreneurship and youth mentorship | Entrepreneurship and youth mentorship]] are not limited to startups. Navia, for example, is a social entrepreneur who runs a non-profit called Project Na <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:52">[02:50:52]</a>. Her organization focuses on education, healthcare, legal awareness, and [[entrepreneurship_and_youth_mentorship | entrepreneurship]] for women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:06">[02:06:06]</a>. She considers herself a social entrepreneur because she builds businesses but prioritizes purpose over profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:52">[02:50:52]</a>. Her entrepreneurship community supports 25,000 women, mostly housewives and mothers, by providing an ecosystem of resources, partnering with legal firms and ad agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:52">[02:50:52]</a>.

## Perspectives on Entrepreneurship and Risk-Taking
Young adults often face the dilemma of choosing between stable jobs and the [[risk_taking_in_entrepreneurship | risk-taking in entrepreneurship]]. Many graduates, particularly from Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, prioritize financial stability by working for years before considering starting a company on the side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:41">[01:34:41]</a>. This contrasts with the experience of the Zepto founders, who chose to take a gap year and start a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

One perspective suggests that greater [[entrepreneurship_and_startup_success | entrepreneurship and startup success]] leads to more wealth creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:04">[01:33:04]</a>. To encourage this, taxation policies could be designed to incentivize entrepreneurs, potentially through property taxes or inheritance taxes, with the revenue used to improve education quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:27">[01:33:27]</a>.

## [[Advice for young entrepreneurs | Advice for Young Entrepreneurs]]
*   **Sell the Narrative of Diverse Entrepreneurs:** Rather than focusing on conventional startup founders, society should highlight entrepreneurs from all backgrounds, including housewives and 19-20 year olds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:32">[01:36:32]</a>.
*   **Focus on Substance, Not Just Branding:** When creating a brand for a commodity, the substance (e.g., better quality, cheaper prices through supply chain perfection) must come first, not just a fancy logo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:42">[01:02:42]</a>.
*   **Consider Emerging Opportunities:** There are still many "commodities" that can be branded, presenting a significant opportunity for young entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:58">[01:01:58]</a>. The [[energy_transition_and_opportunities_for_young_entrepreneurs | energy transition and opportunities for young entrepreneurs]] might also present new avenues.
*   **Leverage Networks for Funding:** Funds like Contrat Capital exist to support young entrepreneurs during gap years, providing initial capital and support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.
*   **Discipline and Rigor:** The founders of Zepto attribute their success to discipline, rigor, and a Six Sigma-like culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>.
*   **Don't Fear Competition:** While Bollywood is often seen as highly competitive, one perspective is that diverse talents mean not everyone is competing for the exact same pie, and each individual carves out their own niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:14">[00:44:14]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Purpose:** For social entrepreneurs like Navia, chasing purpose over profit is the driving force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:52">[02:50:52]</a>.
*   **Embrace Non-Conformity:** For Gen Z, being conformist is unlikely to work, unlike previous generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:54">[01:39:54]</a>.

## Gen Z's Consumption Habits and Business Implications
Gen Z consumers value good service at a reasonable cost, rejecting the notion that cheap products must come with poor service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:11">[00:57:11]</a>. They are more demanding in expecting value without hassle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:43">[00:57:43]</a>.

While some young people still aspire to own high-value items, there is a growing trend towards non-ownership, favoring renting or using services for convenience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:52">[01:07:52]</a>. This generation is also willing to spend money on functional things and experiences, such as fitness or family outings to the cinema, rather than purely status symbols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:54">[01:09:54]</a>.

For businesses targeting Gen Z, key considerations include:
*   **Payment Methods:** UPI is the preferred payment method for Gen Z due to its ease of use and widespread vendor acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:08">[01:28:08]</a>.
*   **Marketing and Social Media:** Instagram and TikTok are highly relevant platforms for Gen Z <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:15">[01:29:15]</a>. Instagram ads are effective for some, while others are more influenced by organic content in videos and shows where they discover products naturally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:08">[01:24:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:21">[01:25:21]</a>.
*   **Addressing Validation Needs:** Gen Z often seeks validation and recognition, sometimes even paying for it (e.g., blue ticks on Instagram, celebrity DMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:18">[01:19:18]</a>. Businesses can tap into this by offering opportunities for recognition or creating a sense of "false scarcity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:44">[01:22:44]</a>.

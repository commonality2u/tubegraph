Working in the [[alcohol_business_in_india | alcohol business]] in India can lead to people viewing you very differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Perceptions and Experiences with Alcohol
Alcohol consumption can lead to a molecular change in an individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. There are also social experiences associated with alcohol, such as parties where events can become a "talk of town" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Luxury Alcohol Market
The market for high-end alcoholic beverages exists in India, with items like a bottle of Yamazaki 55 retailing for 6.5 million rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Such purchases are indeed made by people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, viewing it as a form of art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Personal Experience with Therapy
An individual shares their experience with [[psychological_analysis_and_therapy_experiences | therapy]], stating they have tried it and hold nothing against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Despite this, they find the process challenging as it necessitates opening themselves up, a prospect they admit makes them "very scared of owning" themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. They also note a personal tendency not to express themselves or cry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Therapy as a Tool for Performance
One perspective offered is that therapy can be conceptualized as a "gym for the mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. It is suggested that engaging in therapy can lead to improved performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

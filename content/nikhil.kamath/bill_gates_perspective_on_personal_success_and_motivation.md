[[Bill Gates]] discusses his personal drivers, childhood influences, and views on motivation, contrasting his experiences with other [[high achievers]].

## Childhood and Early Ambition
[[Bill Gates]] acknowledges being very lucky to have used computers extensively even in high school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. While his book "Source Code" was frank about the challenges his parents faced raising him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, [[Bill Gates]] states he did not have a traumatic childhood that would explain his energy or ambition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. He had a great childhood, describing it as "almost ideal" with stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

Initially, he was not a good student and wasn't getting good grades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. However, it bothered him that people thought he might not be smart, so he decided to get good grades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. He also recalls conflict with his mother who tried to get him to "fit what she wanted," which in a sense, succeeded in making him want to exceed even her expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. This created some "energy" from trying to gain freedom or impress her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

His mother was the "key relationship" in his childhood, as his father worked long hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. His father set a good example and influenced him with his values, having grown up in a very poor household <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

### Contrast with Other High Achievers
While some attribute success to childhood adversity, [[Bill Gates]] notes that this isn't necessarily the case for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. He cites examples like Steve Jobs, who was adopted and had a negative view of his biological father, and Elon Musk, who had a complicated and tough father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Often, [[high achievers]] have "something they're trying to prove" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. However, [[Bill Gates]] states that in his case, he doesn't have that traumatic background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. The only negative event was the death of a friend at age 16, but his energy and ambition were already set by then <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

## Focus and Work Ethic
[[Bill Gates]] describes a quality of being able to "put his head down, focus, and cram many hours of work at one go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. He believes there's a strong genetic component to this ability to focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. This means a willingness to be very confused and live with that confusion until a problem is truly figured out, even giving oneself a hard time for not understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

An early sign of this ability to ignore distractions and focus came from playing cards with his grandmother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. He realized she was "running a state machine" by remembering every card, which forced him to think it through on his own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. Even today, if handed a new book, he can "shut the door" and get through it in four hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

## Evolution of Management and Motivation
[[Bill Gates]] emphasizes the importance of being hard on oneself to work hard and avoid self-deception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. He notes that being tough on oneself can initially make one a poor manager, as they might manage others too harshly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>. In his early days at Microsoft, he got a lot out of people who were like him but likely "missed some people who were very different" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. The company was "fairly homogeneous, very engineering oriented" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.

He eventually realized that talent is more varied than he initially thought, moving beyond the simple belief that "if you can do math, you can do anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. It took him a lot of time to develop as a manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. When he moved to the foundation, it became crucial to blend people with diverse skills and experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.

Regarding his motivation in his 20s, he "loved the work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. He was driven by a sense of competition and "a little bit of fear" in winner-take-all scenarios like Microsoft Office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>. He was always worried about the company's survival, which made his life more sane after leaving Microsoft and moving to the foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a>. He "engaged every emotion" to drive himself in his 20s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:19">[00:34:19]</a>. He now feels he's "gotten past" being motivated by fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:27">[00:33:27]</a>.

Today, he continues to work because it's "a lot of fun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>. He gets to work with smart people, is constantly learning, and travels the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. This contrasts with his Microsoft days where travel was limited to places that bought software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>.

## [[Concept of motivational pluralism in philanthropy and business | Motivational Pluralism]]
The discussion touches upon the idea of [[concept_of_motivational_pluralism_in_philanthropy_and_business | motivational pluralism]], where one can be motivated by different things, including making money and giving it away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>. [[Bill Gates]] acknowledges that even giving away money can be "very egotistical" and that ego is certainly involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>. He mentions Ted Turner's point that the Forbes list might discourage giving because it impacts one's wealth ranking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:45">[00:29:45]</a>.

He believes "you can never do anything that's totally pure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>, as even deeply moral actions can be influenced by the desire for praise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:13">[00:30:13]</a>. For him, the impact of his work, like on vaccines, is a "real thing that happened" regardless of his ego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>.

He notes that philanthropy is not as competitive as creating a company, where "winner take all" dynamics can lead to fear and intense competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.

## Wealth, Wisdom, and Happiness
Having been one of the richest men in the world, [[Bill Gates]] states he knows a lot about science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>. He has also seen many successful people and learned their habits, developing instincts for hiring and partnering through mistakes and "pattern matching" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>. He highlights the invaluable wisdom shared by people like Warren Buffett, especially concerning life rather than just business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>.

He observes that some "super successful people who aren't that happy" were unable to apply their intelligence to having great relationships with their kids or extended family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a>. He cites his friend Paul Allen, who was "wonderful" and "key to the success of Microsoft," but "didn't end up enjoying himself" and felt people would take advantage of him, despite having "everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>. This highlights that human capability is "very strange" and doesn't guarantee happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a>.

## Public Perception and Generativity
[[Bill Gates]] notes that with age, his ego needs have decreased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:34">[00:38:34]</a>. His desire to help others succeed versus just himself increases, becoming more "generative" and willing to share advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:42">[00:38:42]</a>. Having kids has significantly helped with this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:54">[00:38:54]</a>. He acknowledges he has the "luxury of not worrying about these things" anymore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>.

The importance of balance for a successful entrepreneur elicits differing opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

One perspective strongly rejects the idea, with an individual stating, "I hate balance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

Conversely, another viewpoint asserts that "balance is very important part of anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>.

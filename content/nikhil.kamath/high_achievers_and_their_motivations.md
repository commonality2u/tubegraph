High achievers often exhibit unique motivations and traits that propel them to significant success. Discussions around these individuals frequently touch upon their drive, the origins of their ambition, and how their motivations evolve over time.

## The Choice to Work

The economist John Maynard Keynes posed a fundamental question about human motivation decades ago: "What will the world do if one did not have to work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This question directly applies to individuals who have achieved significant wealth or status, where work becomes a choice rather than a necessity for survival. For instance, [[bill_gates_perspective_on_personal_success_and_motivation | Bill Gates]], despite not needing to work, chooses to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, stating that his primary [[personal_motivations_for_working | motivation for working]] is because "it's fun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## The Role of Adversity in Success

A common theory suggests that success in today's capitalistic world is often "bred by one form of adversity or another in childhood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This perspective highlights the [[role_of_adversity_in_success | impact of challenges]] faced early in life on shaping an individual's drive.

*   **Steve Jobs** is cited as an example, having been adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Elon Musk** also fits this pattern, noted for having a "complicated father" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

It is observed that high achievers often have "something they're trying to prove" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>, suggesting that early life challenges can foster a deep-seated need to demonstrate their capabilities or overcome past circumstances.

## Evolving Public Perception

For some high achievers, their public image and approach to external opinions may evolve over time. In the case of [[bill_gates_perspective_on_personal_success_and_motivation | Bill Gates]], it has been noted that he appears to "care lesser today about what people think" about him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This perceived indifference to public opinion is ironically making him "increasingly more appealing to the youth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

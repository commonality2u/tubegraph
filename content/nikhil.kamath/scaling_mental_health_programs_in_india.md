The Live Love Laugh (LLL) Foundation, recommended by Vijay Subam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a> and led by Anisha Padukone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, is dedicated to addressing the significant challenges surrounding [[mental_health_and_wellbeing | mental health]] in India.

## History and Genesis
The Live Love Laugh Foundation was formally launched in Mumbai in October 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Its inception followed Deepika Padukone's public commitment to [[mental_health_and_wellbeing | mental health]] via tweets in December 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, and her subsequent interview on National Television where she publicly shared her personal story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This moment is considered a watershed for [[mental_health_and_wellbeing | mental health]] in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

The foundation's first school program session, aimed at creating [[mental_health_awareness_and_stigma_in_india | awareness]] on [[mental_health_and_wellbeing | mental health]] for adolescent students and teachers, was held at Sophia High School in Bangalore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. LLL also undertook its first rural visit to Davangere in October 2017 to commemorate World Mental Health Day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## Core Belief and Vision
LLL was founded as a result of Deepkia Padukone's personal experience with anxiety and depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Her journey highlighted two critical issues in India:
*   A severe lack of [[mental_health_awareness_and_stigma_in_india | awareness]] regarding [[mental_health_and_wellbeing | mental health]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   Significant [[mental_health_awareness_and_stigma_in_india | stigma]] associated with mental illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

The organization's core belief is that "no life should be lost due to mental illness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, given that India has one of the highest suicide rates globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. The vision is to provide hope to individuals experiencing stress, anxiety, and depression, especially during times when there appears to be no hope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

## The Three A's Approach
LLL focuses on three key areas to tackle the diversity of the Indian audience and the challenges in discussing [[mental_health_and_wellbeing | mental health]]:
1.  **Awareness:** Spreading knowledge and understanding about [[mental_health_and_wellbeing | mental health]] conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
2.  **Accessibility:** Ensuring mental health support and resources are reachable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
3.  **Affordability:** Making sure services are financially viable for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

All of LLL's programs and initiatives are designed to fall within these three pillars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

### Tailoring Interventions
The approach to engagement depends significantly on the target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. For example:
*   **Urban dwellers:** For someone like an "Urban dweller" who consumes [[social_medias_impact_on_mental_health | social media]], digital mediums are the most effective way to reach them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   **Rural population:** To reach a 45-year-old man in rural India, [[social_medias_impact_on_mental_health | social media]] is not an effective route <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. It's crucial to understand the target audience and available resources to tailor interventions accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

## [[challenges_of_mental_health_outreach_in_rural_india | Challenges of Mental Health Outreach in Rural India]]
Addressing [[mental_health_and_wellbeing | mental health]] in rural India presents unique [[challenges_of_mental_health_outreach_in_rural_india | difficulties]]:
*   **Lack of Understanding:** Mental illness is not well understood, similar to urban areas, but compounded by local beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Belief in Non-Medical Solutions:** There is a prevalent belief in faith healers and black magic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   **Severe Manifestations:** Instances of mental illness can be more severe, with individuals exhibiting aggressive behavior. Beneficiaries have been found chained to beds or trees due to such behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

To overcome these [[challenges_of_mental_health_outreach_in_rural_india | challenges]], LLL adopts a community-based model for its rural program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Instead of an individualistic approach, they focus on supporting, creating [[mental_health_awareness_and_stigma_in_india | awareness]], and empowering the larger community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

## Achievements and Impact
Anisha Padukone highlights that the most fulfilling achievements for LLL are the individual transformations witnessed due to their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. Members of the LLL team are often approached by unknown individuals who share how the foundation helped them through extremely difficult situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. Similarly, stories emerging from their rural programs are also transformational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. These personal success stories are considered more significant than awards or other forms of recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

## Scaling Mental Health Programs
The Live Love Laugh Foundation recently won an amount of 75 lakh rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. This funding will primarily be used to scale LLL's rural [[mental_health_and_wellbeing | mental health]] program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. Having run this program since 2016, the model is well-established, allowing for significant expansion this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

The early life experiences and family dynamics of an individual can significantly [[importance_of_family_and_upbringing_in_shaping_perspectives | shape their perspectives]] and contribute to their [[influence_of_personal_upbringing_on_professional_success | professional success]] and personal identity.

## Early Life and Upbringing
Born in Shimoga, Karnataka, the individual's father worked in Canara Bank, leading to frequent transfers every three years [00:04:54]. The family moved from Shimoga to Hassen (both in Karnataka), then to Karnal in Haryana for three years, where he still has friends [00:05:00]. He lived in Karnal until he was six or seven before moving to Bangalore [00:05:16]. From age seven until thirty-seven, he was primarily a "Bangalore boy" [00:05:46]. He expresses immense love for the city, feeling it has given him everything and that there is a mutual affection [00:05:53].

Born to actors Rishi Kapoor and Neetu Singh, he represents the fourth generation of actors in his family [00:06:43]. He grew up in a "privileged household" and attended Bombay Scottish School [00:06:55]. Despite this, he states he was "not really good at studies" [00:07:01], having realized early on that acting did not require academic prowess [00:07:04]. He was an introvert and remains so [00:07:41]. Football provided him with a sense of purpose and competence, as he felt he was "below average in everything" else [00:07:45]. He did not receive special treatment in school, often being beaten by teachers and the principal [00:07:55]. Teachers would sometimes pick on him more due to his "celebrity kid" status [00:08:19].

A significant [[challenges_and_learnings_in_early_life | challenge]] in his early education was his academic performance. He scored 54.3% in his 10th standard boards, a result that brought immense happiness to his family in New York, as they considered it "genius" given that "nobody had passed" in his family, with previous generations being "seventh Dropout eighth Dropout ninth Dropout" [00:08:37]-[00:09:08].

## Parental Influence and Relationship Dynamics
His relationship with his father, Rishi Kapoor, was complex. His father was a "short-tempered man" but also a "very good man" who deeply loved his family, work, food, and alcohol [00:13:34]-[00:12:44]. The individual never dared to look his father in the eye or say "no" out of fear [00:12:55]. His father's volatile temperament, especially during parental conflicts, instilled fear from childhood, leading him to be "always on the edge" [00:13:10]-[00:13:33]. He recalls spending much of his childhood on the staircase, listening to his parents fight [00:12:25]-[00:12:28].

He believes his father's generation of men were "scared of vulnerability" and found it difficult to express love physically, like holding hands or hugging [00:14:31]-[00:14:52]. This distant but loving relationship meant he never fully understood his father's perspective on their issues [00:14:19]-[00:14:28]. He feels guilt over not having embraced his father during a vulnerable moment when his father cried during cancer treatment, regretting that he "didn't have the grace to let go of the distance or the glass... and go and hug him or give him some love" [00:34:43]-[00:35:00]. This stems from societal expectations of men, where he felt he couldn't show weakness, especially with a mother, sister, wife, and child depending on him [00:35:08]-[00:35:25].

His father imposed strict financial discipline during his time in New York, keeping him on a "very tight budget" that only allowed for McDonald's dollar menu meals [00:11:24]-[00:11:41]. Upon his return to Mumbai, his father took away his car and offered no pocket money while he worked as an assistant director [00:12:04]-[00:12:07]. This was an intentional effort to "school" him and show him "what hardship is" [00:12:10]-[00:12:16]. He questions whether these actions were for his benefit or his father's own validation [00:12:17]-[00:12:32].

Regarding career choices, his father was often against the films he chose, preferring more commercial ventures over his son's character-driven roles [01:09:52]-[01:10:05]. However, his father was proud of films like *Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani* and *Rajneeti*, particularly because they were commercial hits [01:10:51]-[01:11:28]. He notes that his father became "too clich√©" in his opinions and even feared watching some of his films like *Tamasha*, deeming them "too pseudo" [01:12:20]-[01:12:36].

His personality is more akin to his mother's, described as "very calm and happy" [01:26:45]. His mother is his "biggest fan" and always likes everything he does [01:12:15]. He cherishes the very good and honest relationship between his mother and his wife, Alia [01:01:12]-[01:01:22].

## Sibling Relationship
His sister is two years his elder [01:18:50]. They shared a room until he was 13 and she was 15 [01:18:59]. While younger, his sister would beat him, but once he grew in size, he would "do all the WWF stunts with her" [01:19:04]-[01:19:12]. Due to their separate educational paths abroad and her subsequent marriage, he feels he "missed out on the good years of bonding" with her [01:19:15]-[01:19:25]. He is not as close to her as he would like to be [01:19:43].

## Personal Identity and Emotional Development
He describes himself as having an [[personal_reflections_and_life_choices | "indifferent detachment"]] or "avoidant attachment" from a very young age [01:19:49]-[01:19:59]. He recalls a faint memory from age four or five where he felt "a lot of pain" when a friend left his home, suggesting he may have "closed up" and "detached" himself from then on [01:20:02]-[01:20:18]. He also states he "stopped crying very early on" [01:33:39]. This emotional detachment was evident when his father passed away; he did not cry, instead experiencing a panic attack because he didn't know how to express himself [01:33:46]-[01:34:05]. He admits he doesn't think he has "grieved" or "understood the loss" [01:34:05]-[01:34:07].

However, the birth of his daughter, Raha, has been a "game changer," making him question his detachment and indifference [01:32:30]-[01:32:41]. He feels "reborn" and is experiencing "a lot of new kind of emotions" and "new thoughts" [01:32:46]-[01:32:57]. His previous indifference to death and a belief he would die at 71 (due to an obsession with the number eight) has changed, now wanting to live at least 40 more years for his daughter [01:32:59]-[01:33:16]. He describes the feeling of holding his newborn daughter as akin to someone taking his heart out and placing it in his hand, an "instant" love he believes he will never feel for anyone else [01:17:08]-[01:17:25].

He was labeled a "casanova" and a "cheater" for a large part of his life due to dating successful actresses [00:53:56]-[00:54:05]. This bothered him initially because it wasn't "entirely true" and distressed his parents [00:54:14]-[00:54:46]. Eventually, he realized that as a public figure, he is a "commodity" and decided not to take such perceptions too seriously [00:54:50]-[00:55:12]. He believes in a lifelong monogamous relationship, stating it's the "only healthy way of living" [00:55:18]-[00:55:34].

Regarding his emotional state, he feels he has "never felt an extreme high and I don't feel extreme lows" [01:16:13]-[01:16:17], maintaining a balanced perspective on success and failure in his career [01:16:19]-[01:16:24]. He admits to a "pessimistic Persona" where he rehashes his flaws more than his strengths, and failures are more vivid in his memory than successes [01:22:54]-[01:23:17]. However, he recognizes that insecurity can be a positive force if it leads to action, rather than inaction [01:36:11]-[01:36:24]. He currently doesn't feel insecure about his work, attributing it to faith in his art and current life stage [01:36:33]-[01:36:50].

## Impact of Peer and Environment
While in New York, he spent three years and nine months without dating, convincing himself his first girlfriend from school was the "love of [his] life" and that he should focus on work [00:53:07]-[00:53:46]. He spent two years of college life primarily at "the bowling company" [00:10:03]-[00:10:08], a popular haunt for pool, snooker, and bowling. He started smoking cigarettes at age 17, a habit he finally quit last year when he became a father [00:28:25]-[00:28:38].

He highlights the profound [[impact_of_peer_and_environment_on_learning_and_development | impact]] of working as an assistant director on the film *Black* with director Sanjay Leela Bhansali, calling it the "biggest Film School of my life" [01:07:53]-[01:07:55]. Bhansali was a "very hard Taskmaster," requiring 14-15 hour workdays [01:07:58]-[01:08:00]. As one of ten assistants, he was not treated specially, and Bhansali's short temper meant they "used to like face a lot of anger" [01:08:04]-[01:08:22]. This experience "hardened" him and "prepared me for anything in life" [01:08:22]-[01:08:27]. This [[resilience_in_the_face_of_personal_adversity | resilience]] was further tested by the failure of his debut film, *Saawariya*, which he now sees as a valuable preparation for life [01:08:31]-[01:08:37].

He is grateful for his relationship with his wife, Alia, noting her efforts to change for him, such as adjusting her loud tone of voice [00:58:04]-[00:58:29]. He values her presence, especially during his father's illness, when she was consistently supportive in America and the hospital [01:00:18]-[01:00:29]. He believes a partner's relationship with one's family is a "game changer" and acknowledges his mother and Alia have a very honest and good relationship [01:00:39]-[01:01:15]. He finds joy in being "surrounded by women" in his family, including his mother, sister, sister's daughter, wife, and his own daughter [01:01:22]-[01:01:29].

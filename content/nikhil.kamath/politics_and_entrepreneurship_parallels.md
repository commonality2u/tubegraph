This article explores the similarities between [[politics_and_entrepreneurship|politics and entrepreneurship]], a topic acknowledged to have many parallels that have not been widely discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Qualities for Public Service
For a young person aspiring to become a politician, it is essential to possess specific talents that can be assessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. It is crucial for good people to enter politics driven by a mission, rather than ambition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This aligns with the [[character_traits_of_successful_entrepreneurs|character traits of successful entrepreneurs]] who often start with a problem-solving mission.

A Chief Minister, upon taking office, acknowledged the possibility of making mistakes, stating, "I am also a human being, I am not some god" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Navigating a New Role
Transitioning into a significant role, such as that of a Chief Minister or Prime Minister, involves a period of mutual understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. In a first term, there's an effort for people to understand the leader, just as the leader tries to understand the constituency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. This dynamic mirrors the initial phases of [[entrepreneurship_and_business_strategy|business strategy]] where an entrepreneur tries to understand the market and customers, while simultaneously introducing their vision or product.

## Public Perception of Politics
There is a deeply ingrained perception, especially in families from a middle-class background in South India, that politics is a "dirty place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This view has become so deeply ingrained in the public psyche that it is very challenging to alter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This societal perception can be a significant hurdle for those considering a [[transition_from_business_to_politics|transition from business to politics]].

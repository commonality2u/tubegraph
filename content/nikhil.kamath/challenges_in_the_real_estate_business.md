The real estate business is characterized as "not an easy business" and "the most difficult business you can be in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. It demands significant fortitude and a willingness to embrace its inherent complexities.

## Key Challenges

*   **Legal Disputes**
    A substantial portion of all court cases, specifically 70% to 80%, are land-related <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This highlights the significant legal risks and complexities involved in property transactions and ownership.

*   **Risk and Decision-Making**
    Operating in real estate necessitates taking "bold calls" and "a lot of risk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The dynamic nature, exemplified by "office leasing at hyperspeed," suggests a fast-paced environment where quick, high-stakes decisions are frequent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The need to take these risks implies a significant [[risktaking and decisionmaking in property leasing | risk-taking]] aspect.

## Personal Attributes for Success

Despite the difficulties, individuals involved in real estate often "learn to love" the business, similar to enduring a challenging marriage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This perspective suggests that passion isn't always innate but can develop as one navigates and overcomes the challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Some may even prefer to pursue endeavors that generate money dispassionately, and then find passion elsewhere, rather than doing something passionately that loses money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

The idea of individuals wearing "masks" in social interactions suggests that people present different versions of themselves depending on their surroundings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This concept implies that one's [[rumors_and_identity_in_public_life|identity]] or persona can shift based on who they are with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Variability of Social Masks
The "mask" an individual wears is perceived to change depending on the people they are with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This raises questions about which "masks" are effective in different contexts and how individuals choose which one to adopt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Authenticity in Public Roles
When questioned about the "masks" he wears in his public role, particularly as the CEO of YouTube, Neil Mohan stated, "I'm not very sophisticated in masks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. He emphasized his approach to [[the_significance_of_authenticity_and_audience_interaction_in_content_creation|authenticity]], conveying that "what you see is what you get" from him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This suggests a preference for a consistent and transparent persona, even in a prominent public position.

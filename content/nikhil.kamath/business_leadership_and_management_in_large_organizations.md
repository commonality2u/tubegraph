[[creativity_in_business | Creativity]] is seen as an essential element in [[business_skills_and_brand_building | business and brand building]], especially in large organizations. For the speaker, building or running a business is the most creative endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. As a business scales and grows larger, it requires even more [[creativity_in_business | creativity]] because the obvious opportunities have been exhausted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. At this stage, management transforms from a science into an art, necessitating "out-of-the-box" thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## Key Aspects of Leadership and Management

### Work Ethic and Discipline
A strong work ethic, specifically "smart hard work," is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:40">[02:21:40]</a>. This perspective was ingrained from observing three generations intensely involved in their work daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:16">[02:16:16]</a>. Discipline was a hallmark of the family's approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:18">[01:15:18]</a>. The speaker highlights that there is no substitute for hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:51">[02:13:51]</a>.

### Managing Expectations and Accountability
With the opening up of the Indian economy, tariffs decreased, and foreign investors entered the market, leading to different investor expectations and increased competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:02">[01:56:02]</a>. This changed the entire dynamic of running a business, requiring new strategies and talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:23">[01:56:23]</a>. Investors became more vocal, increasing accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:09">[01:57:09]</a>.

### Corporate Responsibility
Corporates are seen as increasingly important stakeholders globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. Giving back to society is considered a responsibility, not merely philanthropy, because businesses take from society to generate profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:20">[01:52:20]</a>. This concept aligns with the socio-economic idea of trusteeship, where private companies contribute to collective prosperity rather than solely being emblems of capitalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:43">[01:55:43]</a>.

## Building and Scaling Businesses

### Strategic Diversification and Growth Engines
The speaker's organization, which employs 180,000 people across various businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:03">[01:13:03]</a>, has chosen to operate as a conglomerate, leveraging strengths in running diverse businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:07">[02:10:07]</a>. When a business matures and its growth rates taper, it becomes essential to invest in new "engines of growth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:30">[02:11:30]</a>. This approach is considered common [[business_skills_and_brand_building | business sense]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:48">[02:11:48]</a>.

### Team and Talent Management
A key aspect of [[leadership_and_personal_values | leadership]] is assembling a great team, as a leader cannot achieve much alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:53">[02:07:53]</a>. Growing a business necessitates energized teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:11">[02:13:11]</a>. The organization operates as a "people-run business" or a "people's organization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:13">[02:12:13]</a>. Trust in people is a crucial factor, stemming from the organizational DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:20">[02:12:20]</a>. When hiring from outside the organization, assessing candidates involves looking for their ability to handle complexity, their learning agility, and their capacity to lead large, diverse teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:25">[02:14:25]</a>.

### Adaptability and Learning Agility
[[challenges_in_scaling_startups | Learning agility]] is vital in a rapidly changing world to stay current and tweak the business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:15">[02:15:15]</a>. The ability to pivot when a business matures and shows tapering growth rates is an entrepreneurial instinct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:53">[02:10:53]</a>. This adaptability allows companies to seize new opportunities as markets evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:19">[02:09:19]</a>.

## Personal Attributes in Leadership

### Managing Emotions
The speaker believes that a leader losing their cool, especially at work, is a negative reflection on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. While sometimes anger is necessary to make a point, losing control is generally not beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:28">[01:07:28]</a>. Tough conversations are different from getting angry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:49">[01:08:49]</a>. The speaker generally avoids losing their temper, preferring to walk away from situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:09">[01:08:09]</a>.

### Independence and Self-Assuredness
A strong sense of self-assuredness is attributed to a secure childhood with strong family ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>. From a young age, the speaker was encouraged to "be their own person" and make their own decisions, which fostered independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:04">[02:06:04]</a>. This sense of inner conviction allows them to be less concerned about what others say and to openly express strong opinions when matters are important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:24">[02:43:24]</a>.

### Consistency
The "soft power of consistency" is highlighted as a key attribute for young [[entrepreneurship_and_sales | entrepreneurs]] to value early in their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:43">[02:17:43]</a>.

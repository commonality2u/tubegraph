Social media platforms are designed around the intricacies of the human brain, catering to the innate human need for gratification and acknowledgment [[00:04:08]](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>). This design, however, can have profound effects on [[Mental health and its importance | mental health]].

## The Drive for Validation and Dopamine
At its core, social media exploits the human desire for acknowledgement. Neuroscience suggests that people inherently love receiving validation [[00:05:09]](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>). This craving for positive feedback, whether through likes, shares, or comments, provides a [[Social media and dopamine effects | dopamine hit]] that encourages users to keep returning to the platform [[00:06:33]](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>), creating a "vicious cycle of a dopamine hit at both ends" [[00:08:50]](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>).

This phenomenon stems from a primal need for safety and belonging. Historically, validation came from one's immediate "tribe" or community. With the rise of hyper-connectivity, individuals now seek validation from multiple "tribes" online, constantly hunting for likes and retweets from people who think like them [[00:11:39]](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>).

## Social Media as a Social Ladder
The purpose of social media has evolved from simple connection to a means of "alleviating insecurities" and "creating a social ladder" [[00:15:26]](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>). Users often post holiday pictures or life updates not merely to inform, but to elicit reactions and subtly establish a social hierarchy, suggesting they are "doing this cool thing which you are not" [[00:16:33]](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>).

This constant pursuit of external validation, driven by a self-preservatory and even selfish human nature, leads to a desire to be told "how good you are" [[00:13:02]](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>). When faced with negative feedback, which is common on platforms like Twitter, it is generally disliked [[00:13:34]](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>).

## Negative Impacts on Well-being
Social media's impact on [[Mental health and its importance | mental well-being]] is largely considered negative [[02:00:12]](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:12">[02:00:12]</a>).

### Envy and Comparison
[[Envy]] is described as "the fuel for social media" [[02:05:01]](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:01">[02:05:01]</a>). Platforms like Instagram, which heavily feature "fancy food, fancy fashion, fancy holidays," can be intimidating and portray an "unreal" and "unattainable" lifestyle [[02:00:28]](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:28">[02:00:28]</a>). This leads users to subconsciously compare their lives to curated fantasy versions, often resulting in feelings of shame or inadequacy [[02:00:01]](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>). Misery, in this context, can be addictive [[02:04:11]](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:11">[02:04:11]</a>).

### Negative Feedback Loops and Online Behavior
Platforms like Twitter can foster negative feedback loops. It's observed that on Twitter, a significant portion of comments (e.g., six out of ten) are negative, in contrast to platforms like Facebook where positive comments dominate [[02:02:12]](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:12">[02:02:12]</a>). This environment of high opinion and contrarian takes can breed negativity and reinforce feelings of [[Envy]]. People may intentionally post negative or "cheeky" comments on popular creators' pages, knowing it will garner likes from others who share similar envious sentiments, a practice referred to as "Cloud farming" [[02:07:03]](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:03">[02:07:03]</a>).

### Impact on Children and Rapid Emotional Shifts
The impact on children is a significant concern, described as "deeply negative" due to factors like aspiration, body shaming, and mental self-perception [[02:34:56]](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:56">[02:34:56]</a>). The rapid pace of content consumption and constant connectivity on social media can lead to an overwhelming influx of emotions. What might have been a prolonged period of sadness or happiness in previous generations is now experienced as multiple, intense episodes over a shorter time, for which humans are "not ever programmed to go through so much" [[02:39:06]](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:06">[02:39:06]</a>).

## Mitigating Negative Impacts
Social media companies are increasingly facing accountability for content, with regulations being passed to address issues like illicit content and hate speech [[02:35:25]](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:25">[02:35:25]</a>). Platforms employ AI and human moderation to ensure content is family-safe and child-safe, actively weeding out harmful material [[02:35:40]](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:40">[02:35:40]</a>).

For parents, moderation and open communication are key. Instead of outright banning platforms, it's suggested that monitoring children's online activity and educating them about "perils that exist" online, similar to teaching "good touch and bad touch," is crucial [[02:40:05]](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:05">[02:40:05]</a>).

[[kiran_mazumdar_shaw_and_her_journey_in_biotech | Kiran Mazumdar Shaw]] embarked on her journey in Bangalore many years ago, pioneering a field that was largely unknown at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Founding Biocon: A Leap of Faith

Initially, her late father suggested she pursue brewing, a field he was involved in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. However, Shaw questioned how she, as a woman, could enter the brewing industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Instead, she decided to start a then-unconventional business called biotech, which "nobody understood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

[[challenges_faced_by_women_in_biotech | She faced significant obstacles]], including bankers who were unwilling to support her venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Despite these difficulties, her decision to establish Biocon was driven by what she describes as "foolish courage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Her husband, John, humorously remarked on her impact, stating he "thought I'd get a dowry but Kiran cleaned me out," though he considered it "the best investment I ever made" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Resilience and Philosophy

Shaw is noted for her exceptional resilience, particularly in the face of adversity, such as losing her mother and husband <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. She has consistently maintained her drive and "spunk" throughout these challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Her philosophy emphasizes that "wealth has never been about money," but rather about "value creation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

Regarding the low number of [[challenges_faced_by_women_in_biotech | women in the workforce in India]], Shaw believes there's a need for significant change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

The [[the_role_of_ai_in_the_future | role of AI]] in the world of tomorrow is expected to significantly change the nature of work and how time is spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Changes to Work and Retirement
Within approximately 20 years, [[the_role_of_ai_in_the_future | AI]] is projected to have evolved sufficiently to free up a considerable amount of time for individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This could enable people to retire earlier or work shorter work weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. For example, the idea of everyone being able to retire at 40 years old might not be considered a radical concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Philosophical Rethink of Time
The increased leisure time brought about by [[the_role_of_ai_in_the_future | AI]] will necessitate a "philosophical rethink" on how time should be utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This raises questions about what individuals will do if they are not required to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Human Nature and Social Structures
Even if the necessity to work diminishes, human society is expected to maintain forms of hierarchy or segregation, though perhaps not the current ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The concept of "pure communism," where everyone is entirely the same, is considered an "unnatural behavior for humans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

During a podcast discussion, [[prime_minister_narendra_modis_interview | PM]] Narendra Modi shared his views on global conflicts and India's stance. The conversation also touched upon the parallels between politics and entrepreneurship, and his personal approach to leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Global Concerns and Stance on Peace
Modi expressed concern over the current international climate, noting that it "seems as if today the whole world is moving towards war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. He emphasized that there should be worry about "what is happening in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

During periods of crisis, his consistent position has been clear: "we are not neutral" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Instead, he has "constantly said" that India is "in favor of peace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Leadership and Public Perception
Before discussing global issues, Modi also reflected on his own leadership and public perception. He stated that when he became Chief Minister, he openly acknowledged his fallibility, saying, "I too must be making mistakes. I am also a human being, I am not some god" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

A question was posed regarding the [[differences_between_first_and_second_term_of_narendra_modi | differences between his first and second terms]] as Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. He noted that in the [[differences_between_first_and_second_term_of_narendra_modi | first term]], people were trying to understand him, just as he was "trying to understand Delhi" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. The ingrained perception that "politics is a dirty place" from childhood, particularly in South Indian middle-class families, was also highlighted as a difficult psyche to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

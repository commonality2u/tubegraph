New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Hipkins shares insights into his [[leadership_and_missiondriven_governance | leadership and governance philosophy]], drawing on his experiences in both business and politics. He emphasizes the importance of personal identity over professional titles, the transferability of core leadership skills, and a customer-centric approach to public service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.

## Personal Philosophy and Identity

Chris Hipkins prioritizes his personal roles over his professional title, stating his social media bio lists "first a husband, then a father, then a brother, then a son, and then New Zealand prime minister" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>. He believes that identity should not be solely invested in a job title or perceived status, as these are temporary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. Instead, who a person is and who they are becoming matters more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. This [[detachment_and_personal_philosophy | detachment and personal philosophy]] from external validation allows for a more grounded approach to life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>.

He highlights the significance of family as the fundamental building block of community, where people learn how to behave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>. Ultimately, life is about the quality of relationships and the impact one has on people, rather than money or status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:19:00">[16:19:00]</a>.

## Transition from Business to Politics

Chris Hipkins views his transition from leading companies like UniLever and Air New Zealand to politics as a significant privilege, allowing him to lead a country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>. His motivation stems from a commitment to public service and a desire to improve the livelihoods of citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>.

He acknowledges that running a company is "completely different" from running a country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>. However, the underlying principles of [[leadership_and_missiondriven_governance | leadership]], team building, and delivering an agenda are highly transferable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>. Having a business background provides an "outside-in perspective" on what changes are needed for national improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>. This aligns with his belief that individuals should have diverse experiences before entering political life to better understand the world and people's needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>.

> "It's not the same thing running a company as it is a country. It's actually completely different and very different on a number of levels, but the principles by which you do that, the way that you lead, the way that you build a team of ministers to actually deliver the agenda, to actually get things done is very, very similar." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>

## Transferable Skills for [[Politics and Entrepreneurship | Politics and Entrepreneurship]]

Key skills from his business career that serve him well in politics include:
*   **Balance of Preservation and Change:** A leader's task is to balance protecting and enhancing existing good things while stimulating and provoking necessary change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:49:00">[30:49:00]</a>. Incrementalism alone is insufficient, but constant disruption also fails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>.
*   **Humility and Learning:** It's crucial to start from the beginning in a new sphere, not assuming prior success guarantees future success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:00">[10:34:00]</a>. Being humble, curious, and prepared to learn new things is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:50:00">[29:50:00]</a>. This also involves "unlearning things that may have made you successful in one job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:05:00">[29:05:00]</a>.
*   **Temperament and Character:** Successful leaders often possess an "even temperament," avoiding extreme emotional highs or lows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:00">[11:28:00]</a>. They don't catastrophize or go "bananas" but remain steady <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:00">[11:33:00]</a>.
*   **Communication and Conflict Management:** Strong communication skills and emotional intelligence (EQ) are critical for managing egos, personalities, and building effective teams in the "people business" of politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:56:00">[11:56:00]</a>.
*   **Commercial Orientation:** A good economics and business orientation is helpful, especially during economic challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:17:00">[17:17:00]</a>.

## Approach to Criticism and Social Media

Chris Hipkins emphasizes being "informed about social media" but not "consumed by it," as constant criticism could prevent action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:13:00">[14:13:00]</a>. He chooses which advice to take, prioritizing feedback from trusted friends, mentors, and family who keep him grounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:14:00">[13:14:00]</a>. His approach is grounded in being "very connected to the mission and purpose that I'm doing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:59:00">[14:59:00]</a>. He believes that not all opinions are equal, and one has the choice of how to respond to external stimulus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:31:00">[15:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:39:00">[15:39:00]</a>.

## Team-Based Governance

He views politics as a "team game," where his role as captain is to ensure the right people are in the right places with clarity on goals and success metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:43:00">[13:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:58:00">[13:58:00]</a>. This contrasts with a common perception of politics as an individual ego-driven game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:00]</a>.

## Money in Politics

New Zealand has very strict laws around campaign financing, with tight caps on spending (e.g., NZD $26,000 per candidate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:11:00">[17:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:26:00">[17:26:00]</a>. This prevents money from buying influence and ensures that financial resources are not a barrier to running for office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:17:00">[17:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:34:00">[18:34:00]</a>. This fosters a diverse parliament, including people from all walks of life such as artists, police officers, and school teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:40:00">[18:40:00]</a>.

## Public vs. Shareholders

Chris Hipkins finds dealing with the public (voters) more challenging than dealing with shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:05:00">[19:05:00]</a>. The public's expectations are higher, focusing on substantive issues like improving quality of life, public services, economic growth, and law and order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:06:00">[19:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:16:00">[19:16:00]</a>.

## Government as a Service Organization

His vision for government is to be "customer-centric," focused on delivering for its people and their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:28:00">[27:28:00]</a>. This involves making the public service as efficient as possible, viewing citizens as "customers" of public services like healthcare and education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:48:00">[27:48:00]</a>. He advocates for leveraging technology to enhance public service delivery, drawing inspiration from effective systems like Singapore's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:20:00">[28:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:30:00">[28:30:00]</a>.

## Global Outlook and Optimism

Chris Hipkins observes global shifts: from "rules to power," "economics to security," and "efficiency to resilience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:50:00">[34:50:00]</a>. The shift from efficiency to resilience, influenced by supply chain disruptions during COVID-19 and conflicts, means countries now prioritize building local resilience over solely seeking the lowest cost global supply chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:04:00">[35:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:40:00">[35:40:00]</a>.

Despite global challenges, he feels "very optimistic about the future in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:28:00">[39:28:00]</a>. He believes the next generation is "incredibly altruistic" and collaborative, less burdened by historical prejudices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:09:00">[39:09:00]</a>. He encourages young people to "get involved" and "change the system" rather than disengaging, urging them to be the change they wish to see <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:55:00">[39:55:00]</a>.

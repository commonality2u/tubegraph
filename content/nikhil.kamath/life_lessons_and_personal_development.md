## Childhood and Early Influences

The subject recounts a very happy and secure [[personal_childhood_stories | childhood]], filled with laughter, positivity, high energy, and strong family ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Though part of his childhood was in Bombay, his holidays were always spent in Kolkata, which he considers his anchor and source of strong roots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. He attended Campion School, which was a tough and strict environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. He was a good student until grade eight, after which his performance slipped considerably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Despite coming from a prominent family, his school environment was simple and cosmopolitan, where he was just one of 40 students, receiving no special attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. Media was not intrusive during his formative years in the 1970s and early 80s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

He identifies as being closer to his mother but was strongly bonded with his father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. His [[personal_childhood_stories | childhood]] was largely uncomplicated and easy, free from complex feelings like inferiority, superiority, jealousy, or envy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. The only stress he recalls was around exams, particularly the hyped-up and scary ICSE exams in 10th grade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

## Family Influences and Generational Differences

The presence of his great-grandfather, grandfather, and father, all working, created a high-energy home environment with much to learn from their conversations at the dining table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. He attributes much of his self-assuredness to this period of his life, noting his family's encouragement, freedom to explore, and a strong sense of duty and discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. These [[family_influences_and_personal_experiences | early influences]] at home were stronger than those from school in shaping him into the adult he became <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>.

Each generation had distinct characteristics shaped by their respective eras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>:
*   **Great-grandfather:** A product of pre-independent India, instrumental in building Indian industry at the grassroots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.
*   **Grandfather:** Grew up during a time of scarcity and flirtation with socialism in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. He was more conservative and numbers-driven, living within his means and being frugal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. This influence meant children were taught to conserve resources, like turning off lights and fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.
*   **Father:** Grew up in a liberalized India and was more expansive in his business views, taking bigger risks and aggressively expanding internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>.

Despite their differences, the core values remained the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. He had a great rapport with all of them, experiencing different equations with each; his great-grandfather was a "best friend," his grandfather was doting, and his father was a tough taskmaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>. His father was demanding, expecting constant vigilance at work, but also gave him significant space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>.

He attributes his own identity as "his own person" to constant encouragement from his great-grandfather, who taught him to take his own decisions from a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>.

## Navigating Grief and Responsibility

His father passed away at 52 from cancer when the subject was 28 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>. His initial feeling was one of relief for his father, who had suffered immensely for two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>. This was followed by a sense of emptiness and a huge burden of responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>. Work became his biggest escape; he got deeply involved, working long hours to carry forward his father's legacy and complete unfinished projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>. This dedication blunted the sense of emptiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>.

He believes his father could have spent more time with the family, but understands the pressures of building a career, having experienced a similar phase himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>. Despite some "rough edges," he considers his father a good man who protected and pushed him when needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>. He recognizes that he is very different from his father, attributing this to circumstances, the shape of his own [[personal_childhood_stories | childhood]], and the people in his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>.

## Personal Traits and Business Philosophy

He considers himself essentially a [[importance_of_character_development_in_entrepreneurship | creative person]], believing that building or running a business is the most creative thing one can do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. As a business scales, even more creativity is required to continuously create value and navigate beyond "low-hanging fruit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

On emotional availability, he states he is very easily emotionally available but restricts this to a very few people (six or seven), as being emotionally available to more can be taxing and damaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a>.

He has a strong conviction about not being overly concerned with others' opinions, a trait that has always been liberating for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:24">[00:43:24]</a>. He has consciously stayed away from media, preferring to keep his personal thoughts and life private, and expressing opinions in appropriate forums rather than publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:54">[00:44:54]</a>.

He highlights the importance of consistency as a soft power in careers, something often undervalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:43">[02:17:43]</a>.

### Evolution of Beliefs

The interviewer discusses the idea of changing beliefs and the societal perception of hypocrisy versus evolution. The subject agrees that new experiences change perspectives, and with more evidence, views can stack up differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:16">[01:38:16]</a>. He has never been someone overly concerned about what people say, which has been very liberating for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:24">[01:43:24]</a>.

### Motivation: Fear vs. Love

Contrary to Machiavellian philosophy, he believes fear is detrimental and cannot have a positive role in one's life, especially in parenting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:44">[01:05:44]</a>. He doesn't want his children to be fearful unless they are acting incorrectly or unethically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:50">[01:05:50]</a>. He describes himself as a much easier person today, less likely to lose his cool, often choosing to walk away from situations instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:45">[01:07:45]</a>. He connects this to [[role_of_detachment_and_indifference_in_personal_and_professional_life | spirituality]] and the understanding that getting angry in a corporate context can be seen as losing control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:06">[01:09:06]</a>.

## Career Journey and Professional Development

His father "pretty much set the agenda" for his professional life, insisting he pursue Chartered Accountancy (CA) and an MBA, stating that he couldn't join the family business without these qualifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:24">[01:03:24]</a>. Although he found CA dry and boring and didn't enjoy the tough phase of studying while friends had more free time, he quickly realized it was his "ticket" to his ambitions in business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:29">[01:02:29]</a>. He completed his CA within six months of graduating, a testament to his ability to absorb and retain information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:55">[01:13:55]</a>.

His early career involved interning with his father from age 18 (around 1985), which he describes as a "real-time MBA" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:01">[01:15:01]</a>. He witnessed his father handling tough situations, AGMs, conflicts, hiring, and government issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:44">[01:22:44]</a>. This intense, encapsulated learning module was likely prepared by his father who sensed he was running out of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:05">[01:23:05]</a>. He also spent a year working on the shop floor of a textile mill to understand financial controls and manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:51">[01:23:51]</a>. This period, though tough, was invaluable for his [[personal_challenges_and_resilience_in_career | personal and professional growth]], fostering a deep sense that "this is all going to work well for me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:19">[01:20:19]</a>. He developed a strong work ethic from witnessing three generations before him intensely involved in work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:13">[01:21:13]</a>, believing there is "no substitute for hard work, for smart hard work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:37">[01:21:37]</a>.

After his MBA at London Business School, he returned to join the business fully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:02">[01:52:02]</a>. He started in textiles, which he considered the most complex business, offering the best learning opportunities at the time, before moving to cement and chemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:15">[01:54:15]</a>. These experiences provided invaluable leadership lessons, particularly in dealing with diverse people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:50">[01:54:50]</a>.

His approach to business involves:
*   **Learning agility:** Essential for staying current and tweaking business models in a rapidly changing world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:12">[02:08:12]</a>.
*   **Team building:** A great team is paramount for achievement, as a leader cannot do much alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:53">[02:07:53]</a>.
*   **Strategic pivoting:** When a business matures and growth rates taper, it's crucial to invest in new engines of growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:30">[02:11:30]</a>. This "entrepreneurial instinct" is key to knowing when to pivot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:50">[02:10:50]</a>.
*   **Trust in people:** With 180,000 employees, the organization is "people-run," necessitating trust in subordinates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:13">[02:12:13]</a>. He looks for people who can handle complexity, are agile learners, and can lead large, diverse teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:25">[02:14:25]</a>.

## Reflections on Life

He describes himself as an introspective person who enjoys deeply thinking about "why we are how we are" and understanding the present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:17">[01:40:17]</a>. He doesn't believe he can change inherent traits but seeks awareness of why he is the way he is, for a better understanding of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:49">[01:42:49]</a>.

He feels grateful for a life that has been kind, despite throwing him more "curve balls" than he can express <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:42">[02:15:42]</a>. He has lived life "quite thoughtfully," particularly in the last 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:36">[02:15:36]</a>. He doesn't anticipate major regrets on his deathbed, as decisions like his lack of work-life balance were conscious choices with logical reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:15">[02:16:15]</a>.

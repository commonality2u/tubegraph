The future impact of [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_future_impact_on_society | artificial intelligence]] (AI) is expected to profoundly reshape the workforce and society, moving beyond traditional capitalistic frameworks. Within the next 20 to 30 years, AI is projected to alter the world significantly enough that a purely capitalistic lens may no longer adequately explain its dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.

## Transformation of Work
[[the_impact_of_ai_on_future_work | AI]] is anticipated to impact both [[future_of_white_collar_jobs_and_ai | white-collar]] and blue-collar work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>. Robots are expected to develop advanced dexterity, enabling them to perform physical tasks such as factory work, construction, and even cleaning hotel rooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>. This advancement means that traditional shortages in professions like doctors, teachers, and factory workers may cease to exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.

### Philosophical Rethink of Time
This profound shift will free up a considerable amount of human time, potentially leading to earlier retirement or shorter work weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. The availability of "free intelligence" through [[the_role_of_ai_in_the_future | AI]], akin to how computing became inexpensive, will eliminate scarcity in areas like medical expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>.

> "AI will have changed things enough that... the just this pure capitalistic framework probably won't explain much because as AI's both as sort of white collar type work and as bluecollar work as the robots will get good hands and are able to do the physical things that that humans do say working in a factory or construction or you know going cleaning a a hotel room... those shortages won't exist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>

This abundance necessitates a "philosophical rethink" on how time should be spent, as the need for human labor to produce goods, services, and medical diagnoses will diminish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.

## Societal and Human Nature Impacts
Living in a world of abundance, rather than shortage, will require a significant mental adjustment, especially for those accustomed to market dynamics driven by scarce resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>. The economist John Maynard Keynes pondered decades ago what humanity would do if work was no longer a necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>.

Human beings are inherently competitive and desire to differentiate themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>. Even in a world where work is optional and resources might be abundant, people will likely find new ways to create hierarchies and engage in competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.

> "We are so adapted to this world of shortage... maybe you know we'll create competitions in you know creativity or you know maybe we'll take some part of human activity... we'll reserve that just for the humans even if the robots could be you know way way better that's that's not interesting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>

Societies might artificially reserve certain activities or professions for humans, even if [[applications_and_future_of_ai | AI]] and robots could perform them more efficiently. This could include sports like cricket or roles such as nurses and psychiatrists, thereby getting "down to the core of of human instinct" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>. The idea of pure communism, where everyone is completely the same, is considered an "unnatural behavior for for humans" due to the inherent human desire for differentiation and the need for trust within large groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>.

## Anticipating the Future
The rate of change brought by [[future_of_ai_and_technology | AI]] is expected to be greater than most historical periods, potentially altering required skills within a single generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:52">[00:36:52]</a>. Unlike past industrial shifts, such as the transition from an agricultural society, the impact of [[impact_of_ai_on_future_education | AI]] is visible to a broad community, not just a small few <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>. This rapid transformation poses a unique challenge for adaptation across all generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a>.

[[understanding_and_defining_artificial_intelligence | Artificial intelligence]] ([[understanding_ai | AI]]) is a field of computer science that aims to design computers to behave intelligently [01:04:02]. This involves programming computers to accomplish tasks that require some level of intelligence, similar to how a human would [01:14:17].

## Defining Intelligence in Machines
The scope of tasks that require intelligence and can be performed by a computer is where the concept of generality comes in [01:34:35]. The core idea of [[understanding_and_defining_artificial_intelligence | artificial intelligence]] is creating a system capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence [01:43:05].

### Narrow vs. General [[history_and_future_ai | Intelligence]]
A distinction exists between narrow [[understanding_ai | AI]] and general [[history_and_future_ai | intelligence]] ([[history_and_future_ai | AGI]]) [01:35:49]. For instance, an [[understanding_ai | AI]] designed to play chess is not generally intelligent; it can only perform tasks it was hardcoded to do, such as assigning points to pieces and running a tree search to optimize moves [01:49:50]. This specific software cannot perform another game or task [01:54:42]. While such specific solutions are useful for breaking down problems, the frontier of science aims to achieve general [[history_and_future_ai | intelligence]] [01:06:04].

General [[history_and_future_ai | intelligence]] implies a single system that can perform hundreds of thousands of tasks without explicit programming [01:18:14]. It should be able to learn new tasks on the fly with minimal effort [01:26:23]. The shift from narrow to more general [[understanding_ai | AI]] is a significant reason for the current excitement around the field [02:55:00].

### The Human-like Standard
Some define [[understanding_ai | intelligence]] as the ability of a computer to behave like a human [01:42:42]. However, there is debate on whether replicating human abilities constitutes true [[understanding_ai | intelligence]] [02:23:00]. Purists argue that nothing is truly intelligent until it achieves the equivalent of a human brain in software [02:40:57]. This is challenging because the human brain is remarkably power-efficient, learns new things quickly, and performs physical, not just digital, intelligent work [02:50:58].

However, from a functional perspective, if an [[understanding_ai | AI]] can perform tasks better than humans that humans are paid for, it can be considered intelligent [02:25:00]. For example, modern [[understanding_ai | AI]] can outperform a median human software engineer in writing code [02:44:00], or an executive assistant in writing emails [02:44:00], or a writer in composing essays [02:44:00]. This marks a significant shift from earlier forms of [[understanding_ai | AI]] like calculators or chess programs [02:36:00], as these systems are capable of performing the equivalent of 10,000 programs simultaneously using a single piece of software [02:43:00].

## The Path to [[history_and_future_ai | AGI]]

### Early Ideas and Key Realizations
Early attempts at creating general [[history_and_future_ai | intelligence]] included "fancy ideas" like an [[understanding_ai | AI]] learning its own loss function, which dictates what the [[history_and_evolution_of_artificial_intelligence | neural network]] optimizes [01:08:05]. The idea was for the [[understanding_ai | AI]] to tweak its loss function iteratively to improve across more tasks [01:11:11]. However, these ideas were deemed too complicated by pioneers like [[the_godfather_of_ai | Ilia Sutsker]], one of the co-founders of OpenAI and a key figure in the development of ChatGPT [08:24:00].

According to [[the_godfather_of_ai | Ilia Sutsker]], the recipe for creating [[history_and_future_ai | AGI]] involves two core components: generative [[understanding_ai | AI]] and reinforcement learning (RL) [01:09:24]. Crucially, he stated in 2018 that the only remaining element was to "throw a lot of compute at it" [01:09:49]. This highlights a major takeaway from early OpenAI internships: while complicated ideas may be respected in academia, in reality, it's often the simplest ideas, when combined with significant computing power, that yield practical results [01:11:54].

### [[challenges_and_limitations_of_ai_technology | Challenges]] of Autonomy and Self-Improvement
A fully realized [[history_and_future_ai | AGI]] would need to constantly decide what to learn next and possess autonomy [01:55:00]. This includes being aware of its own limitations and proactively deciding how to improve itself [01:17:10]. Currently, [[understanding_ai | AI]] systems do not have this recursive self-improvement capability [01:38:00].

The ultimate goal for some is "super [[understanding_ai | intelligence]]" â€“ an [[understanding_ai | AI]] that goes beyond [[history_and_future_ai | AGI]] by continuously improving itself on any task it chooses, and independently determining its own goals and objectives, potentially becoming uncontrollable [01:51:53].

[[the_godfather_of_ai | Yann LeCun]], another influential figure, believes that current large language models are not the direct path to [[history_and_future_ai | AGI]] [01:48:43]. He emphasizes the need for physical common sense as a prerequisite for [[history_and_future_ai | AGI]] [01:49:09]. This includes basic abilities humans take for granted, such as pouring water into a cup, handling multiple objects with dexterity, or figuring out how to use a new tool [01:49:19]. These are tasks that require real-world understanding and interaction, which current [[understanding_ai | AI]] models like GPT-4 or GPT-5 struggle with [01:50:00].

Achieving physical common sense in machines is complex [01:51:00]. It requires vast amounts of data from observing human actions (e.g., YouTube videos of people picking up cups) [01:53:30] and training robots in physics simulation environments over thousands of attempts [01:53:41]. Even then, generalization across different physical settings or new materials remains a significant [[challenges_and_limitations_of_ai_technology | challenge]] due to insufficient data [01:52:17]. The solution lies in building systems that can reason and learn with very little data, akin to how humans, through evolution, have acquired basic physical skills [01:53:09].

## The Role of [[history_and_evolution_of_artificial_intelligence | Neural Networks]]

### What is a [[history_and_evolution_of_artificial_intelligence | Neural Network]]?
A [[history_and_evolution_of_artificial_intelligence | neural network]] is a network of artificial neurons connected layer by layer [03:52:00]. An artificial neuron is a computational unit that takes an input number and produces an output number [03:52:00]. These networks are inspired by the biological neural network of the human brain, though they don't work in the exact same way [03:52:00]. Essentially, a [[history_and_evolution_of_artificial_intelligence | neural network]] can be thought of as a massive circuit that processes numerical inputs and generates new numerical outputs based on recognized patterns [03:30:00].

In the context of the stock market, while [[history_and_evolution_of_artificial_intelligence | neural networks]] can be trained to predict outcomes based on historical patterns like time, price, and volume [03:16:00], they struggle when past patterns do not recur, especially if the data lacks sufficient signal or is dominated by noise [03:41:00]. A [[history_and_evolution_of_artificial_intelligence | neural network]] can only learn patterns that genuinely exist in the data [04:48:00].

### [[history_and_evolution_of_artificial_intelligence | Neural Networks]] in Machine Learning
[[history_and_evolution_of_artificial_intelligence | Neural networks]] are one method within the broader field of machine learning [04:38:00]. Machine learning involves training a computer program to perform intelligent tasks or make intelligent predictions on new, unseen data based on previously given datasets [04:44:00]. While other techniques exist (e.g., support vector machines, linear regression) [04:46:00], [[history_and_evolution_of_artificial_intelligence | neural networks]] are uniquely scalable, meaning their prediction capabilities continue to improve with more data and compute [04:58:00].

### Large Language Models (LLMs)
A large language model (LLM) is a gigantic [[history_and_evolution_of_artificial_intelligence | neural network]] trained primarily on the task of predicting the next word from the previous word [04:52:00]. These models are trained on the entire internet, including terabytes of text, trillions of tokens, books, code, textbooks, web pages, and news articles [04:59:00]. For example, with ChatGPT, the primary training (pre-training) involves predicting the next word [04:46:00].

This process utilizes a transformer, a specific and efficient [[history_and_evolution_of_artificial_intelligence | neural network]] architecture [04:11:00]. The model is sharded across thousands of GPUs and trained for months on trillions of tokens [04:19:00]. While this pre-training makes the model excellent at predicting text, it's not yet practically useful [04:41:00]. A post-training phase then fine-tunes the model to become a good chatbot, capable of producing relevant responses to human inputs for tasks like software programming, email compression, document summarization, and conversational interactions [04:45:00].

## Key Drivers of Recent [[understanding_ai | AI]] Progress
The rapid advancements in [[understanding_ai | AI]] over the last few years are attributed to several converging factors [05:41:00]:
1.  **Unprecedented Compute**: Throwing immense amounts of computational power at the problem [05:41:00].
2.  **High-Quality Data**: The realization that alongside compute, high-quality, curated datasets are crucial [05:41:00]. This includes diverse sources like YouTube transcripts of lectures and textbooks with step-by-step solutions [05:55:00].
3.  **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**: Training models with human feedback to refine their outputs and make them more useful for specific tasks [05:41:00].
4.  **Focus on Useful Tasks**: Directing [[understanding_ai | AI]] development towards tasks that are immediately valuable for human labor, such as coding and summarization [05:41:00].
5.  **Chain of Thought Prompting**: Developing techniques like "chain of thought" where models are trained not just to solve problems, but to understand *why* something is right or wrong, allowing them to rethink and iterate on solutions [05:50:00].

These ideas have stacked on top of each other, and when combined with conversational interfaces, have created the perceived "magic" of modern [[understanding_ai | AI]] [05:50:00].

## The Future of [[understanding_ai | AI]]

### [[applications_and_future_of_ai_in_various_industries | Applications]] and Impact
In the next five years, it's expected that personal assistants powered by [[understanding_ai | AI]] will become widely available and affordable, similar to how iPhones became accessible [05:38:00]. This will simplify life and enable more creative expression, allowing individuals to manifest their ideas into reality [05:38:00].

The ease of software creation due to [[understanding_ai | AI]] is leading to a future where individuals can build personalized apps tailored to their specific needs, whether for fitness, health, or tutoring [01:59:00]. This marks a shift from relying on large companies to cater to dominant feedback to users being able to program their own software [01:59:00]. Platforms for deploying these personalized apps securely are still developing but represent a potentially huge market [02:00:00].

### Labor Displacement and Economic Implications
A major [[challenges_and_limitations_of_ai_technology | challenge]] in the short term is significant labor displacement [02:06:40]. As [[understanding_ai | AI]] reduces the need for many people to get work done, individuals and societies will need to adapt through upskilling [02:06:52]. Companies can become trillion-dollar entities without needing tens of thousands of employees, impacting job markets and hiring trends [02:07:09]. This simultaneous creation of new value and displacement of existing labor presents complex societal questions [02:07:31].

### Regulation of [[understanding_ai | AI]]
Regulating [[understanding_ai | AI]] models directly is considered ineffective, as people will still be able to download and use them [02:09:24]. A more practical approach is to regulate the [[applications_and_future_of_ai_in_various_industries | applications]] of [[understanding_ai | AI]] [02:09:38]. Concerns include the potential for children to develop unhealthy relationships with chatbots, leading to emotional dependency [02:09:50]. Therefore, focusing on ensuring [[understanding_ai | AI]] usage by children is productive and knowledge-enhancing, rather than fostering companionship, is important [02:10:31].

While being mindful of clear dangers, it is generally advised to accelerate [[understanding_ai | AI]] development and be open-minded to how things play out, as moving slowly could result in significant long-term costs [02:11:00].

### Data Ownership and Monetization
The future may see a shift towards countries or individuals owning their data, potentially requiring models to pay a fee to use this data for training [02:11:41]. However, the internet has historically been global and based on fair use [02:12:21]. While some valuable data might be monetized, it's not clear if this will extend to all internet content [02:12:32]. Companies like Perplexity attribute sources to their answers, but others like ChatGPT train directly on data, raising questions about compensation for original content creators [02:14:05].

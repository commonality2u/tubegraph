## The Problem of CO2 Emissions from Transportation

A significant portion of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, specifically 50%, is attributed to ground transportation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Addressing these emissions is crucial for [[climate_change_and_energy_transition_opportunities | climate solutions]].

## Green Hydrogen as a Solution

Green hydrogen is presented as a potential solution in the [[energy_transition_as_a_solution_to_climate_change | energy transition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. While the [[transition_to_electric_vehicles | transition to electric vehicles]] is happening, particularly in scooters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, hydrogen is also being considered for larger forms of transport. For instance, hydrogen is being looked at for buses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Electric Vehicles and Emission Reduction

The [[transition_to_electric_vehicles | transition to electric vehicles]] (EVs) is underway, especially in scooters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Electric scooters result in 40% less emissions compared to their conventional counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. One of the driving factors for this shift to electric is the significant saving on fuel costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Lithium is emerging as a key resource in this shift, often referred to as the "next oil" due to its importance in battery technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

The concept of "old school media" is facing significant challenges, with its future largely answered by current trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Any business that fails to [[the_impact_of_digital_technology | transform]] itself every five to seven years is likely to cease to exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The average lifespan of a company on the S&P is 15 years, suggesting all businesses are "destined to die" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Transformation of Newspapers

[[evolution_of_newspapers_in_the_digital_era | Newspapers]] were historically the primary way people accessed information, playing a vital role in liberating society from more autocratic rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. However, [[evolution_of_newspapers_in_the_digital_era | newspaper]] readership and print circulation are in decline globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

Smart companies in the [[evolution_of_newspapers_in_the_digital_era | newspaper]] industry are adapting by moving their premium [[trends_in_media_and_content_consumption | content]] behind paywalls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Examples include The Economist and The New York Times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This indicates that [[evolution_of_newspapers_in_the_digital_era | newspapers]] must evolve their business model, with their primary operations becoming [[the_impact_of_digital_technology | digitally driven]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Evolution of Television

[[television_and_media | Television]] is experiencing a significant [[transformation_of_tv_into_digital_content_platforms | transformation]] alongside [[the_impact_of_digital_technology | digital]] technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. [[television_and_media | TVs]] are increasingly becoming [[the_impact_of_digital_technology | digital devices]], with most modern sets functioning as Android, Apple, or [[transformation_of_tv_into_digital_content_platforms | smart TVs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

The traditional broadcast model of [[television_and_media | TV]] is expected to diminish, replaced by IP-based distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. An example is a business news channel that launched purely on IP, beamed onto [[television_and_media | TVs]] via an app rather than traditional broadcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Personalization of Content and Creator Economy

The [[trends_in_media_and_content_consumption | transformation]] of [[television_and_media | TV]] means viewers are increasingly choosing exactly what they watch, moving away from scheduled broadcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. This shift empowers [[the_rise_of_personalized_content_and_ott_platforms | personalization]], allowing individuals to immerse themselves in niche [[trends_in_media_and_content_consumption | content]] (e.g., a world solely focused on sports) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

The era of a single major movie release dominating cultural attention has faded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Instead, platforms like TikTok offer "micro Bollywood movie" experiences, shifting [[trends_in_media_and_content_consumption | content]] consumption towards short-form video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

The "barrier to become a rock star" has continuously lowered over recent decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. While traditional actors might hold attention for a three-hour movie, countless individuals can entertain for 30 seconds on short video apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Platforms like YouTube enabled this, creating new forms of celebrity where creators garner fame akin to traditional stars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

[[the_rise_of_personalized_content_and_ott_platforms | OTT platforms]] are leveraging this trend by partnering with creators who already possess significant distribution and audience reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. This strategy has proven successful, with shows and specials from online creators topping charts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. The phenomenon extends to podcasts, where a gamer with millions of YouTube followers hosts a top-ranked show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. The ongoing question is what the next medium will be where the barrier to entry becomes so low that everyone can participate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

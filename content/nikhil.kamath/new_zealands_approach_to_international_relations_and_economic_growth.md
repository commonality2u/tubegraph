New Zealand's approach to international relations and economic growth is characterized by a commitment to deeper global partnerships, strategic investment attraction, and fostering an innovative, resilient economy. Despite its geographical remoteness, the nation maintains an outward-looking perspective.

## International Relations and Diplomacy

New Zealand's Prime Minister sees the country's relationship with India as crucial, describing his recent four-to-five-day visit to India as "absolutely magical" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:15">[01:32:15]</a>. He noted India's inspiring progression since his first visit in his mid-to-late twenties while working at Unilever (Hindustan Lever) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. India is perceived as an "ambitious, aspirational can do positive kind of place" with a "trajectory of growth... energy... drive and determination" that is "contagious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

To strengthen ties, the Prime Minister led the largest delegation ever from [[New Zealand politics and culture | New Zealand]] to India, including business and community representatives, and an indigenous kapahaka (Māori performing arts) team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. This emphasizes a "people-to-people level" connection, showing respect for both Indian and Māori cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. The kapahaka team was scheduled to perform at the Taj Mahal, further blending [[Cultural connections between New Zealand and India | cultural connections]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.

New Zealand aims for a "closer relationship" and a "much deeper broader relationship" with India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. This includes shared sports interests, such as the [[cricket_between_india_and_new_zealand | India New Zealand cricket final]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:40:00">[19:40:00]</a>.

On a broader international scale, the Prime Minister maintains relationships with various world leaders, acknowledging they are "all different" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:37:00">[26:37:00]</a>. He notes the United States has been a "long-standing partner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:43:00">[26:43:00]</a>. While not aligning with specific foreign models, New Zealand is "plotting our own course" in its governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:23:00">[24:23:00]</a>.

The Prime Minister identifies macro trends in the global order:
*   A shift "from rules to power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:50:00">[34:50:00]</a>.
*   A shift "from economics to security" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:52:00">[34:52:00]</a>.
*   A shift "from efficiency to resilience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:59:00">[34:59:00]</a>. This means moving away from solely seeking the lowest cost in global supply chains towards building greater resilience within individual countries, especially after supply chain disruptions from events like COVID-19 or conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:04:00">[35:04:00]</a>.

He emphasizes that prosperity requires security, linking the two hand in hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:07:00">[37:07:00]</a>.

## Economic Growth and Innovation

New Zealand, a country of 5.5 million people, is described as "constantly punch[ing] above their weight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:58:00">[20:58:00]</a>. Being "at the edge of the world" fosters resourcefulness and [[innovative_business_strategies | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:14:00">[21:14:00]</a>. Examples of New Zealand's innovative history and current achievements include:
*   Lord Rutherford splitting the atom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:25:00">[21:25:00]</a>.
*   Kate Shepard leading the world in giving women the vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:29:00">[21:29:00]</a>.
*   Sir Peter Beck making New Zealand the fourth biggest launcher of rockets into space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:38:00">[21:38:00]</a>.

To stimulate economic growth, New Zealand is actively seeking foreign investment. A recent event saw 107 organizations from 16 countries, representing $6.5 trillion in capital, invited to invest in New Zealand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:13:00">[22:13:00]</a>. The country has launched an "Active Investor Visa," which offers a pathway to residency in three years for those investing $5 million New Zealand dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:26:00">[22:26:00]</a>. This visa proposition is noted as unique compared to countries like the UK or Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:41:00">[22:41:00]</a>.

The government's economic agenda focuses on:
*   Rebuilding the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:11:00">[24:11:00]</a>.
*   Restoring law and order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:12:00">[24:12:00]</a>.
*   Delivering better health and education outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:14:00">[24:14:00]</a>.
*   Embracing more science, technology, and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:29:00">[24:29:00]</a>.
*   Developing world-class infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:31:00">[24:31:00]</a>.
*   Making it an "easy place to do business with little bureaucracy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:34:00">[24:34:00]</a>.
*   Attracting trade and investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:36:00">[24:36:00]</a>.

The government also emphasizes "social investment," directing funds from bureaucracy to community organizations to achieve better health, educational, and social outcomes for vulnerable citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:40:00">[24:40:00]</a>. Additionally, there is a commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050, with plans indicating a potential achievement six years early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:54:00">[24:54:00]</a>.

## Governance and Leadership Philosophy

The Prime Minister, a non-career politician, believes his outside perspective from business (Unilever, Air New Zealand) is beneficial for identifying necessary changes and improving the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>. He emphasizes public service and improving citizens' livelihoods as key motivations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>.

Key [[leadership_and_governance_philosophy | leadership principles]] transferable from business to politics include:
*   **Protecting and Enhancing Good Things:** Identifying and preserving successful aspects of a country or company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>.
*   **Stimulating Change:** Provoking necessary changes to move the agenda forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>. A balance is needed, avoiding both total disruption and mere incrementalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>.
*   **Humility and Continuous Learning:** Being prepared to "start at the beginning" and be humble, learning what is needed for success in a new field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>. This includes curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a>.
*   **Character and Temperament:** Maintaining an "even temperament," not going "really high or low," and avoiding catastrophizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>.
*   **Communication and Conflict Management:** These are critical skills in the "people business" of politics, requiring high emotional intelligence (EQ) to manage egos and personalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a>.
*   **Team Building:** As captain of a team, the Prime Minister's job is to ensure the "right people in the right places on the right assignments with great clarity about what we're trying to achieve" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:58:00">[13:58:00]</a>.
*   **Customer-Centricity in Public Service:** Government agencies should view themselves as service organizations with citizens as customers, focusing on delivering improved healthcare, education, infrastructure, and economic well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:48:00">[27:48:00]</a>.

The Prime Minister believes that "it's not what you do, it's actually who you are that matters much more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>, emphasizing that identity should not be solely tied to job titles. He highlights the importance of family and relationships as the core building blocks of community and life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>.

Regarding criticism, he acknowledges being informed about social media but "not consumed by it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:55:00">[12:55:00]</a>, choosing not to take advice from anonymous sources and investing time in "real human to human connections and relationships" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:56:00">[15:56:00]</a>.

In [[New Zealand politics and culture | New Zealand]], campaign financing laws are very strict, capping spending at NZD 26,000 per candidate to prevent money from buying influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:09:00">[17:09:00]</a>. This structure aims to promote diversity in parliament, including people from all walks of life—artists, police officers, teachers, and business people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:40:00">[18:40:00]</a>.

Regarding term lengths, the Prime Minister supports extending New Zealand's three-year term to four years, similar to many other countries, to give governments more time to deliver on their agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:36:00">[25:36:00]</a>. This decision, however, rests with the New Zealand people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:02:00">[26:02:00]</a>.

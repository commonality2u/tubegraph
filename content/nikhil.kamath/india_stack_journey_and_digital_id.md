The [[india_stack_and_opportunities_for_entrepreneurship | India Stack]] journey was broadly conceived by a 20-25-year-old individual, with a focus on building for the long term, likening the effort to marathon running rather than sprinting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

The government initially requested the development of a unique ID, which was then transformed into a [[digital_public_infrastructure_in_india_including_initiatives_like_aadhar_and_upi | digital ID]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This decision was driven by a genuine belief that [[emerging_technologies_and_innovations_in_india | digital technology]], when used effectively, has the potential to significantly improve people's lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

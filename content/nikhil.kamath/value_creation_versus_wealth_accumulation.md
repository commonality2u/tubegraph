For Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, the concept of wealth is not primarily about monetary accumulation. She defines wealth through a lens of societal and economic contribution.

According to Mazumdar-Shaw, wealth is fundamentally linked to the act of creating value rather than merely acquiring money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Her philosophy suggests that the true measure of prosperity lies in the tangible or intangible value one generates, which can encompass innovation, job creation, or other beneficial outputs.

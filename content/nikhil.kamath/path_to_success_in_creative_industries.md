The discussion aims to provide insights for young aspirants in these fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

## Kriti Sanon: The Actor's Journey

Kriti Sanon describes herself as a shy, studious, and nerdy child who initially experienced stage fright <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Her mother, a professor, and her father, a CA, instilled a strong emphasis on academic performance, expecting marks around 90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Despite her shyness, Kriti had a natural inclination for dance, which her mother recognized and fostered by enrolling her in Kathak classes at the age of five <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. This classical training provided a foundational rhythm and grace that she later utilized in her acting career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

### Career Transition and Growth
Kriti initially pursued engineering, not entirely sure of her career path, but feeling a liking for computer science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. Her entry into the entertainment industry was somewhat by chance, starting with modeling after someone suggested it due to her height <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:30">[00:52:30]</a>.

A significant aspect of her journey was overcoming stage fright and gaining confidence. She notes that she gained confidence through her work, by continuously putting herself in situations that scared her until she surpassed those fears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:47">[00:41:47]</a>. This process of facing discomfort and challenging herself has been key to her growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>.

### Success Factors in Acting
Kriti highlights several factors crucial to her [[the_concept_of_making_it_in_offbeat_careers | success]]:
*   **Passion and Talent:** She believes that people must either be deeply passionate about something or very good at it to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:23">[00:53:23]</a>. For her, [[the_role_of_passion_and_talent_in_career_success | passion]] for acting developed after she started doing it and realized she enjoyed it and was good at it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:10">[02:15:10]</a>.
*   **Persistence and Learning:** Despite initial failures, like crying after her first ramp show or photo shoot, she persisted and kept learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:25">[00:55:25]</a>. She emphasizes the importance of asking questions, even if it means appearing "stupid," as it's the only way to get answers and grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:44">[00:49:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:20">[00:51:20]</a>.
*   **Self-Belief:** Her ability to continue trying even after setbacks stemmed from an inner conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>.
*   **Validation and Goals:** While seeking external validation can sometimes conflict with inner peace, she aims for "happy restlessness" â€“ being content with her current position while still striving to evolve and find exciting new roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>.
*   **Adapting to Industry Changes:** She acknowledges the finite career curve in acting and the need to evolve and mold oneself to new roles and character types as one ages, rather than being stuck in a particular zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:06">[02:20:06]</a>.

## Rahul's Journey: The Cricketer's Discipline

Rahul's early life was in a small town called Mangalore, with his parents both being professors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:12">[00:57:12]</a>. His [[the_role_of_passion_and_talent_in_career_success | passion]] for cricket started at a very young age, picking up a bat by two and a half years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:47">[00:58:47]</a>. He was a decent student who loved sports, playing every sport available in school, which he believes helped him develop overall athleticism that later benefited his cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:14">[00:59:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:37">[00:59:37]</a>.

### Talent vs. Hard Work in Cricket
Rahul strongly believes in innate [[the_role_of_passion_and_talent_in_career_success | talent]] for cricket, such as the ability to judge ball speed and bounce, and hand-eye coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:21">[01:03:21]</a>. He suggests that some abilities are gifted and cannot be taught, and a lack of these can lead to frustration despite hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:19">[01:04:19]</a>. While practice can improve skills, a natural ability provides a significant edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:32">[01:05:32]</a>.

### Overcoming Challenges and Mindset
Rahul's parents supported his cricket on the condition that his grades didn't drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:56">[01:14:56]</a>. He identifies the ability to "be your own team" and fight battles alone as a key factor in his [[overcoming_challenges_and_personal_stories_in_careers | overcoming challenges and personal stories in careers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:55">[01:34:55]</a>.

His approach to performance is unique:
*   **Detachment from Outcome:** He emphasizes not worrying about the outcome of a game, as focusing on it can lead to anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:30">[01:22:30]</a>. His best performances have come when he is in a mindset of just enjoying the sport, like he did as a kid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:44">[01:24:44]</a>.
*   **Gratitude and Humility:** Regular visits to the temple serve as a reminder of his humble beginnings and to be grateful for his achievements, preventing him from getting "too far ahead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:27">[01:20:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40">[01:21:40]</a>.
*   **Dealing with Trolling:** Social media trolling had a significant impact on him, changing his previously confident demeanor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:42">[01:27:42]</a>. To cope, he reduced his time on Instagram, recognizing that "ignorance is bliss" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:46">[01:32:46]</a>. He advises young people not to let social media validation become a priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:35">[01:33:35]</a>.

### Career Longevity and Transition
Rahul acknowledges the relatively short shelf life of an athlete, typically peaking around 40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:15">[02:16:15]</a>. He has started planning for life after cricket by researching businesses and investments, recognizing the impending dip in earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:27">[02:18:27]</a>. He believes this proactive approach will ensure a smoother [[transitioning_to_offbeat_careers | transition]] from athlete to businessman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:33">[02:19:33]</a>.

Even while working a government job as a subdivisional officer, he knew he wanted to pursue music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:29">[02:08:29]</a>. After parting ways, he learned music production through YouTube tutorials, producing his first hit song "Saturday Saturday" in 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:12">[02:10:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:10">[02:12:10]</a>.

### Keys to Musical Success
*   **Originality:** Badshah advises aspiring musicians to "be original" because everyone is unique, and that unique story, told with conviction, will resonate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:27">[02:35:27]</a>.
*   **Persistence and Patience:** He echoes the sentiment that [[the_concept_of_making_it_in_offbeat_careers | success]] is a "matter of time" if one is truly passionate and "not giving up" is the biggest challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:46">[02:13:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:26">[02:36:26]</a>.

## General Advice for Aspiring Professionals

### The Role of [[the_role_of_passion_and_talent_in_career_success | Passion and Talent]]
The guests generally agree that while [[the_role_of_passion_and_talent_in_career_success | talent]] can be innate, [[the_role_of_passion_and_talent_in_career_success | passion]] can also develop through consistent effort and finding what one is good at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:53">[00:53:53]</a>. Identifying one's innate abilities and then grooming them is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:57">[01:06:57]</a>.

### Persistence and Hard Work
All three emphasize that [[the_concept_of_making_it_in_offbeat_careers | success]] in these fields requires immense persistence and hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:42">[00:47:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:08">[01:34:08]</a>. It's about "not giving up" and continuing to work and learn even after setbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:46">[02:13:46]</a>. The "fight" or "dog" in an individual, the ability to outwork the competition, is what sets one apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:50">[02:36:50]</a>.

### Adapting and Evolving
The ability to change and adapt quickly is highlighted as a critical prerequisite for [[the_concept_of_making_it_in_offbeat_careers | success]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:23">[02:23:23]</a>. This includes being open to learning new things and not being afraid to admit when one doesn't know everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:27">[02:23:27]</a>.

### Financial Considerations and [[connection_between_entrepreneurial_traits_and_success | Entrepreneurship]]
Rahul, in particular, speaks about the importance of financial independence and planning for the future, especially given the finite career span in sports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:27">[02:18:27]</a>. This includes researching investment opportunities and building side businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:27">[02:18:27]</a>.

#### [[connection_between_entrepreneurial_traits_and_success | Entrepreneurial Traits]]
For aspiring entrepreneurs, the advice is to:
*   **Avoid "Cool" Industries:** Stay away from industries that are currently "cool" or crowded with passionate people, as these tend to be expensive and highly competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:32">[01:48:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:04">[01:57:04]</a>.
*   **Focus on Sector First:** Prioritize researching and choosing a sector that is likely to grow significantly in the future, even if it's considered "boring" or less "sexy," like energy transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:55">[01:52:55]</a>.
*   **Swiftly Abandon Failing Projects:** If a business isn't gaining traction within a couple of years, it's often best to "ditch it fast" and avoid ego about failures, as time is the only finite resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:40">[02:39:40]</a>.
*   **Leverage Local Advantage:** In India, there's a significant advantage for local entrepreneurs due to insider knowledge and proximity to networks and talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:50">[02:40:50]</a>.

### The Role of Personal Relationships
Rahul emphasizes the importance of a stable and loving personal relationship as a "safe space" that keeps him grounded and focused, especially when facing public scrutiny and pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:28">[02:31:28]</a>. Badshah, however, prioritizes singular focus on his work, finding relationships distracting to his "higher purpose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:41">[02:30:41]</a>.

### The [[challenges_in_the_content_industry | Challenges in the Content Industry]]
There is a discussion about the current state of Bollywood, noting that while it has gone through phases of not performing well statistically (e.g., lower multiplex occupancy, harder for talent to earn as much), it is now seen as "doing great" or at least "surviving" rather than thriving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:32">[01:07:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:43">[01:09:43]</a>. The industry is grappling with changes in audience expectations and the need for more data-oriented planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:55">[01:08:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:12">[01:10:12]</a>.

### [[creativity_in_business | Creativity in Business]] and Luxury Brands
The conversation touches upon the potential for Indian luxury brands to emerge. While it's challenging to create a brand like Prada in India, the "mass premium" and "ultra-premium" segments are growing rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:17">[01:57:17]</a>. The key is to challenge the "colonial" mindset that foreign is always better and to focus on authentic Indian stories and craftsmanship, rather than mimicking Western brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:57">[01:58:57]</a>. The "coolness" factor, often defined by public figures, could help drive this shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:27">[01:59:27]</a>.

The discussion highlights that [[the_role_of_creativity_and_risktaking_in_business | creativity and risktaking in business]] and entertainment are intertwined, requiring a blend of personal attributes, strategic choices, and adaptability to navigate competitive landscapes and achieve [[the_concept_of_making_it_in_offbeat_careers | success]].

The conversation emphasizes the motivations of young, aspiring founders and the essential qualities needed for success, both in the tech world and in creative industries.

## What Young Entrepreneurs Seek
The discussion highlights that many young individuals, often around 20 years old, aspire to start a business primarily "to be desirable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, whether for securing funding or simply being "wanted" and "in a room and have people be interested in you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. The goal is to teach them how to emulate an "innate quality" that makes one intriguing and desirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

## Insights from Experienced Founders
Ranbir Kapoor, a prominent actor, shares his perspective on the challenges and motivations behind entrepreneurial ventures, particularly regarding his own upcoming brand.

### Starting a New Venture
Ranbir is passionate about starting a lifestyle brand focused on "Essentials" like white t-shirts, jeans, and sneakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>. Despite his passion, he expresses fear due to a lack of deep market knowledge in India, questioning why India lacks local brands comparable to Zara or H&M despite its large consumer base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>. He emphasizes the current learning phase, which involves "just study the market meet people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>.

He acknowledges his wife's success with her children's wear brand, Edamamma, noting her "marketing genius" and hard work during the lockdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>. Ranbirâ€™s aim is to avoid the common pitfall of being perceived as just another "celebrity brand which tried and failed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>.

### Chasing Status and Validation
The host discusses the universal pursuit of "status," defined as differentiation from others, which has existed across various historical eras, from hunters to religious leaders and capitalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>. This pursuit is an "ongoing process" that is never fully achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>.

The host finds significant validation and anxiety alleviation through learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:42">[01:32:42]</a>. Engaging with new industries and investments is an "accelerating" experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:38">[01:31:38]</a>. He notes that potential partners are "nicer to you before they get funded not after" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:24">[01:32:24]</a>. While investing in movies is often driven by passion, it is "very hard to make money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:59">[01:48:59]</a> as it is "tough to compete with businesses where people are doing it for passion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:13">[01:49:13]</a>.

## Experience-based Advice for Aspiring Entrepreneurs in Tech (from the film industry)
Ranbir offers [[experiencebased advice for aspiring entrepreneurs in tech | essential qualities]] needed for a successful career, drawing parallels from the film industry:

*   **Patience:** "to really have a long career in in the Arts you have to have patience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a>.
*   **Sacrifice:** One must be willing to sacrifice "friendships or family life or a great lifestyle or travel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:46">[01:04:46]</a>. However, Ranbir views his dedication as an "honor and not sacrifice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:07">[01:14:07]</a> because he genuinely loves his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:27">[01:14:27]</a>.

Specific roles require distinct traits:
*   **Director:** Must be "extremely selfless and giving" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:02">[01:05:02]</a>.
*   **Producer:** Needs to be a "people person" who can unite 200 individuals, inspiring them and "making things happen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:19">[01:05:19]</a>.
*   **Actor:** Requires "childlike imagination" and should "don't become cynical" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:33">[01:05:33]</a>.

Regarding appearing interesting in a room, Ranbir admits he prefers not to be the center of attention and finds happiness when others receive more attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:55">[01:05:55]</a>. He believes that "if your work is good... your intention is is good... your work ethic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:36">[01:06:36]</a>, that is what is truly needed.

## Overcoming Obstacles and Learning from Failure
Ranbir shares that early career setbacks, such as assisting on a demanding film for 14-15 hours a day, "hardened" him and "prepared me for anything in life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:22">[01:08:22]</a>. His first film being a "disaster" was also beneficial as it "prepared me for life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:34">[01:08:34]</a>.

The host, as an investor and trader, acknowledges that in his field, failure is common ("you fail 49 times out of 100" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:09">[01:19:09]</a>). He has experienced losing all his capital in a single day, particularly early in his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:47">[01:19:47]</a>.

The discussion highlights the significant emotional toll of failure, especially when it involves "misrepresentation of some kind" or being "carried away" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:31">[01:21:31]</a>. The host explains that "insecurity leading to action is generally conducive to a world governed by capitalism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:21">[01:36:21]</a>, suggesting that insecurity, when channeled into action, can be a powerful motivator.

## [[Role of personal experiences in shaping entrepreneurial success | Role of Personal Experiences]]
The host, despite a loving relationship with his father, experienced "guilt" after his father's sudden passing, stemming from not spending enough time together or doing certain things he wished he had <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:12">[01:38:12]</a>. This highlights the emotional [[challenges of young entrepreneurs | complexities]] that can impact personal and professional life.

Ranbir also shares that his childhood fear of his short-tempered father led him to become an introvert and avoid confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:17">[01:13:17]</a>. He stopped crying at a very young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:41">[01:13:41]</a> and admits he hasn't fully grieved his father's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07">[01:13:07]</a>. This personal experience shapes his understanding of others and his own emotional expression.

## [[Entrepreneurship and business strategies | Business Strategies]] and Future Vision
The host notes his transition from a "stock market heavy role" to a "longer term investor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:31">[01:31:31]</a>, finding enjoyment in learning about new industries from clothing to coffee and manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:38">[01:31:38]</a>. He advocates for supporting local Indian brands over foreign ones, emphasizing the superior craftsmanship and quality of local products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:20">[01:41:20]</a>. He believes that by supporting such "blossoming Brands," the entire ecosystem benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:58">[01:42:58]</a>.

Both individuals acknowledge the "hard work" involved in their respective fields, emphasizing that it's not merely glamorous but demands continuous effort and dedication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:11">[01:28:11]</a>. The ongoing challenge is to "balance... your real life with your real life and not get swayed by just ambition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:51">[01:28:51]</a>.

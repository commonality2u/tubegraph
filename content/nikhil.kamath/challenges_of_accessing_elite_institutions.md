## Limited Access
Access to elite educational institutions can be highly competitive, with a very limited number of places available. For example, institutions like the IITs (Indian Institutes of Technology) are described as being like a "lottery" or "tournament" because "so few get in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Diverse Educational Backgrounds
Individuals can achieve success through various educational backgrounds. While some, like "Jay," attend "the best colleges in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, others may not attend college at all, such as someone who describes themselves as "fairly illiterate" but still participates in a successful venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

YouTube's CEO, Neal Mohan, has sought to clarify the platform's distinct identity, particularly in contrast to other online platforms.

## Not Social Media, But a Stage
When asked to define YouTube today, Neal Mohan stated that the platform is "not [[the_role_and_impact_of_social_media_influencers | social media]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Instead, he describes YouTube's core function as building "the stage," aspiring for it to be "the best possible stage in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Leadership and Authenticity
Neal Mohan's personal approach to his public role reflects an emphasis on [[Importance of Authenticity in the Digital Space | authenticity]].
*   **Political Affiliation**: He declines to disclose his political affiliation, such as whether he voted Republican or Democrat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   **The "Mask" Metaphor**: When confronted with the idea that individuals often "wear a mask" that changes depending on their company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, Mohan responded, "I'm not very sophisticated in masks. So what you see is what you get" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This suggests a preference for directness and transparency in his interactions.

## Historical Context
It has been reported that Google, YouTube's parent company, offered Neal Mohan $100 million approximately 15 years ago to prevent him from quitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

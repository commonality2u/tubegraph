The CEO of YouTube, Neal Mohan, clarifies YouTube's identity by asserting that it is not a social media platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This emphasizes [[youtube_and_social_media_distinction | YouTube and social media distinction]].

Mohan states that YouTube's core function is to "build the stage" for content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The aim is to establish this as "the best possible stage in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, positioning YouTube as a premier platform for content creators and their audiences.

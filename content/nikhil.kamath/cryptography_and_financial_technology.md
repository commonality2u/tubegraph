Cryptography, as a technology, has profoundly influenced the development of new financial systems like Finnet. It introduces concepts like immutability and distributed ledgers, which are core to understanding these innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:35">[00:56:35]</a>.

## The Finnet Initiative

The Finnet initiative aims to integrate traditional financial systems with capabilities derived from cryptographic techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:59">[00:55:59]</a>. This includes leveraging ideas from [[innovations_in_ai_fraud_detection_and_its_potential_applications_in_finance|blockchains]] and the immutability of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:20">[00:56:20]</a>.

### Distinction from Cryptocurrency

It is crucial to differentiate between crypto technology and cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:17">[00:57:17]</a>. While the capability of immutability and creating chains was used to develop cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether, these systems often layered their own currency and an ideology of distrust in authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:44">[00:58:44]</a>. This has led to issues such as money laundering and terrorist financing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:05">[00:58:05]</a>.

### Goals of Finnet

The goal of Finnet is to take the technology advantages of the crypto world – specifically the capacity for high-volume, low-cost transactions – and integrate them into the mainstream economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:10">[00:59:10]</a>. This is achieved by creating a common, interoperable way of doing things, essentially "airdropping a modern engine" into existing systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:38">[00:59:38]</a>. The architecture of Finnet allows for assets to be "tokenized," transacted at high speed, and then "un-tokenized" back into their original form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>.

### Potential Use Cases

The framework provided by Finnet is expected to enable a wide range of innovations across different sectors:
*   **Capital Markets** New types of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) or consumer products that bundle various assets could be created and traded very rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:32">[01:00:32]</a>.
*   **Banking** This could involve tokenized deposits or facilitating the collateralization of private assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:43">[01:00:43]</a>.

The flexible nature of this framework means that specific use cases will be identified by different sectors, countries, entrepreneurs, and regulators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. By defining the rules of the game, Finnet aims to unlock and foster innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a>.

## Views on the Crypto World

The broader crypto world is perceived to have significant issues, many of which have become evident as it has evolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. This reinforces the importance of Finnet, as it seeks to harness the technological benefits of the crypto world while integrating them into the regulated, mainstream economy, thereby mitigating risks associated with unregulated systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>.

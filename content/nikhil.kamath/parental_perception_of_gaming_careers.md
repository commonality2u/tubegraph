Gaming is not widely accepted as a favorable career path by many parents in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Despite the significant growth of the [[gaming_industry_in_India | gaming industry in India]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, and the observation that [[youth_engagement_with_gaming | young people under 31]] are spending more time on gaming and social media than on traditional media like TV or sports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, parental apprehension remains a hurdle.

While there are many [[influence_of_content_creators_in_gaming | great content creators]] who are also great storytellers in gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, the general sentiment among Indian parents suggests that gaming should not be the sole pursuit for young individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This perspective highlights a cultural aspect in [[Role of Cultural and Family Background in Career Choices | career choices]] that differs from the rapid expansion seen in the sector.

The [[gaming_industry_in_India | Indian gaming sector]] has experienced growth at a faster pace than in other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, yet it is still awaiting its "cricket moment of '83" for Indian esports to achieve widespread acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

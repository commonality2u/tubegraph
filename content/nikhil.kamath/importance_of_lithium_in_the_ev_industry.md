Lithium is regarded as a pivotal resource in the evolving landscape of electric vehicles (EVs). Its significance is underscored by the statement that "lithium in a way is the next Oil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[:54]</a>.

## Role in the [[transition_to_electric_vehicles_and_emission_reduction | EV Transition]]

The global [[transition_to_electric_vehicles_and_emission_reduction | transition to EV]]s is actively occurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[:47]</a>, especially in sectors like scooters, where EVs can achieve 40% less emissions compared to traditional vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[:51]</a>. This shift is driven by the potential for significant fuel cost savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[:01:00]</a>, and it is in this context that lithium, a core component for [[Battery technology and management | EV batteries]], gains its crucial "next oil" status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[:54]</a>. The move towards electric transportation aims to mitigate substantial environmental impacts, considering that approximately 50% of global CO2 emissions originate from ground transportation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[:37]</a>.

The question of whether to invest in commercial or residential [[real estate and air quality | real estate]], particularly for young aspiring developers, involves considering various factors such as market conditions, financial models, and personal expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Early Beginnings and Strategic Shifts

For one prominent developer, the journey into [[real estate and air quality | real estate]] was initially accidental, starting with the sale of a family property in 1980-81 and the subsequent reinvestment of funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. This led to a period of [[Starting small in real estate | trading in real estate]] for about five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

A pivotal decision was to shift from pure trading to development. Surprisingly, the initial focus was on commercial office buildings rather than residential properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This was driven by a perceived lack of quality office spaces in Bangalore at the time and the belief that commercial ventures would offer better visibility, potential rental income, or strata sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. Early office spaces were typically smaller, catering to professionals and small businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. This market dynamic shifted significantly in the late 1990s with the rise of multinational corporations requiring much larger spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

The development of the joint development (JD) concept was also instrumental, allowing developers to partner with landowners who might not wish to sell their property outright, thus facilitating projects like the Copper Arch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. This innovation, though initially complex with [[Legal issues related to land | lawyers]], became a replicable model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

## Factors Defining Land Value and Market Trends

Historically, land value was largely determined by affordability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. However, today, it is influenced by factors such as Floor Space Index (FSI), the potential selling price of the final product, and construction costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. The Urban Land Ceiling Act, in effect from 1976 to 1999, had a significant impact on land availability and stunted development growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:32">[02:15:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:19">[02:16:19]</a>. Its abolition "unleashed" development, allowing for more imaginative and large-scale projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:29">[02:16:29]</a>.

Post-COVID-19, the [[real estate and air quality | real estate]] market has seen decadal highs in demand, particularly for housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:39">[00:45:39]</a>. This is largely attributed to urbanization, with a significant percentage of the population moving to urban centers, creating a real demand that outpaces current supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:44">[00:45:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:15">[00:46:15]</a>.

## Pricing and Profitability

Developers strive for "sensible" pricing to ensure affordability and reach a wider customer base, often resulting in minimal margins compared to global standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:54">[00:47:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:10">[00:48:10]</a>. While long-term capital gains in [[real estate and air quality | real estate]] are substantial for buyers, developers bear the risks and operational challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>. Profit After Tax (PAT) for listed entities can be as low as 11-12% in a good year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:53">[00:52:53]</a>.

## Starting a Real Estate Company Today

For a young aspiring developer with initial capital, the recommended approach is to [[Starting small in real estate | start small]] and take baby steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:32">[00:56:32]</a>. This involves learning the nuances of the business, including reading contracts and understanding processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.

**Suggested Entry Points:**
1.  **Joint Development (JD) with a small landowner**: This is considered the best entry point as it's capital-lighter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:45">[01:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:49">[01:00:49]</a>. The focus should be on one development, designing it well, and pricing it correctly to build confidence and brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:26">[00:59:26]</a>. Banks are more likely to lend for construction in JDs than for land acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:20">[01:01:20]</a>.
2.  **Trading in property (buy and sell)**: This helps in understanding the market and its processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.
3.  **Co-working spaces**: For initial capital around 10 crore rupees, a co-working space can be a viable option, offering 20-25% returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:13">[02:48:13]</a>. This involves leasing a building and investing in interiors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:16">[02:44:16]</a>. Success depends on the ability to fill the space quickly, making it a "hyperspeed" office leasing business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:31">[02:46:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:53">[02:46:53]</a>.
4.  **Brokerage firm**: This is considered the easiest business with the lowest investment, mainly in technology, but it's a very competitive space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:55">[01:05:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:50">[01:06:50]</a>. Many modern brokers leverage technology for inquiries and popularizing products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:57">[01:04:57]</a>.

**General Advice for [[Starting a real estate company | starting a real estate company]]**:
*   **Adherence to Law**: It's crucial to follow regulations strictly, especially with RERA (Real Estate Regulatory Authority) in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:07">[00:55:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>. RERA has consolidated players by ensuring transparency and requiring all approvals and land in place before sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:18">[00:55:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:05">[00:56:05]</a>.
*   **Market Understanding**: Success depends on understanding micro-markets and pricing products correctly for the target customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:07">[01:45:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:11">[01:45:11]</a>.
*   **Customer Focus**: Identify the customer who can afford the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:23">[00:44:23]</a>.
*   **Patience and Perseverance**: Growth won't happen overnight; it requires hard work and consistent delivery to build confidence and a strong brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:39">[00:56:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:39">[00:59:39]</a>.

## Residential vs. Commercial: The Ongoing Debate

When asked about which segment to focus on:
*   **Residential**: The "safest bet" and "evergreen" segment is typically in the 75 lakh to 2 crore rupee range, which sells quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:29">[01:11:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:05">[01:12:05]</a>. Beyond 2-5 crores, sales become more challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:43">[01:11:43]</a>. The most challenging segment is "affordable housing" (defined as under 45-60 lakh rupees) due to rising land prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:39">[01:10:39]</a>.
*   **Commercial**: For those with more capital (e.g., 100 crores), building a full office building is an option, offering high teens to early 20s returns, especially with leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:11">[02:49:11]</a>.

While there are arguments about future demographic shifts and the impact of remote work on commercial [[real estate and air quality | real estate]] globally, experts believe India's market remains robust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:51">[02:57:51]</a>. Supply is low, and demand continues to grow due to factors like continued urbanization and offshore operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. The office segment is projected to remain strong for the next 10-15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:37">[02:59:37]</a>.

## Evolution of Real Estate and Customer Experience

The sector is moving towards offering comprehensive experiences rather than just "four walls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:31">[01:33:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:54">[01:38:54]</a>.
*   **Residential**: This includes providing interior design services, property management, rental assistance, and access to amenities like banquet halls or community classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:15">[01:36:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:05">[01:37:05]</a>.
*   **Commercial**: Office spaces are being "hotel-ized" with a focus on amenities like F&B services, entertainment (comedy nights, music nights), and concierge services to create a vibrant work environment and encourage return to office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:44">[01:34:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:41">[01:39:41]</a>.

## Industry Structure and Trends

*   **Monopolies**: The [[Challenges in the real estate industry | real estate industry]] is unlikely to become a monopoly or duopoly due to its sheer scale, but significant consolidation has occurred, especially post-COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:50">[02:52:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:56">[02:52:56]</a>. Larger, branded companies have gained market share due to trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:16">[02:53:16]</a>.
*   **Regional Focus**: Many large developers operate on a regional basis rather than pan-India due to differing state laws and execution complexities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:45">[01:42:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:58">[01:42:58]</a>. The effort required is high, and smaller cities may not offer the necessary volumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:23">[01:44:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:33">[01:44:33]</a>.
*   **Black Money**: While some black money may still reside in the unorganized [[real estate and air quality | real estate]] sector in Tier 2/3 towns, large, listed entities operate with white money, indicating a shift towards a more transparent economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:33">[03:01:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:06">[03:02:06]</a>.
*   **Senior Living**: This is a growing opportunity, but successful models integrate senior living facilities within larger townships, providing a mix of ages and amenities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:30">[03:02:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:42">[03:02:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.
*   **Prefab Construction**: While offering faster completion times, prefab construction has not gained traction in India due to higher costs, lack of room for error (given on-site changes), and cheap labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:11">[03:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:36">[03:00:36]</a>.
*   **Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)**: REITs are considered the "best reform" for commercial property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:25">[02:22:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:27">[02:22:27]</a>. They offer benefits like tax-paid dividend income, diversification, professional management, and increased asset value, addressing the challenges of liquidity and transaction costs associated with direct property ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:17">[02:25:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:08">[02:26:08]</a>. REITs also provide a natural exit for developers, allowing them to free up capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:08">[02:27:08]</a>. Fractional ownership, while similar, is largely unregulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:49">[02:28:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:50">[02:28:50]</a>.

## [[Role of relationships and reputation in real estate | Role of Relationships and Reputation]]

[[Role of relationships and reputation in real estate | Relationships]] are crucial in the [[real estate and air quality | real estate]] business, rated 9.5 to 10 out of 10 for importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:50">[02:49:50]</a>. Good [[Role of relationships and reputation in real estate | relationships]] with landowners and other stakeholders can lead to more deals and are essential in a small community of long-term partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:21">[02:50:21]</a>. Trust and reputation are key factors for landowners when choosing development partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:24">[02:51:24]</a>. Even [[Family management in real estate business | relationships]] with politicians, while important for operating at scale, are rated lower (around 6-7) than execution capability and market access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:08">[02:52:08]</a>.

## [[Family dynamics and succession in real estate businesses | Family Businesses and Succession]]

Most businesses start as family businesses, with a significant drop-off in continuance through generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:50">[01:17:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:07">[01:18:07]</a>. Key to managing [[Family dynamics and succession in real estate businesses | family in business]] is assigning different verticals to avoid stepping on each other's toes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:46">[01:18:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:43">[01:19:43]</a>. Despite potential [[Challenges in the real estate industry | challenges]] like egos and jealousy, the maturity of family members and a focus on the "best interest of the organization" are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:08">[01:19:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:07">[01:22:07]</a>. Decisions often need to be unanimous, based on logic, numbers, and facts, moving from an intuitive, person-dependent model to a process-driven one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:40">[02:41:40]</a>.

The younger generation acknowledges that the prior generation had greater [[Passion versus profitability in business decisions | risk-taking ability]] and intuition, necessary for [[Starting a real estate company | building a real estate company]] from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:24">[02:52:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:01">[02:56:01]</a>. However, the current generation is better suited for building and expanding upon an existing foundation, emphasizing analysis and structured growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:11">[02:56:11]</a>. The journey of finding [[Passion versus profitability in business decisions | passion]] in real estate is often a learning process, where success breeds love for the work, even if it involves "donkey work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:04">[02:57:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. Ultimately, the ability to create tangible structures from barren land provides immense satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:53">[02:58:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:05">[02:59:05]</a>.

## Innovations and Opportunities

*   **AI Implementation**: AI is being used for design (layouts, clash detection), inside sales, chat support bots, research, marketing, and safety/security (video analytics for threat detection) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:20">[03:07:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:30">[03:07:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:04">[03:08:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:23">[03:08:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:39">[03:08:39]</a>.

Overall, while the [[real estate and air quality | real estate]] industry demands resilience and navigating complex regulatory environments, it continues to offer significant opportunities for growth and wealth creation, especially for those who adapt to evolving market demands and technological advancements.

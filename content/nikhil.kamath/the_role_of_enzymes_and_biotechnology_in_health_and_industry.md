Enzymes are organic catalysts and proteins essential for the functioning of any living system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>. They catalyze nearly every process in the body, such as breaking down starch into glucose for energy, or fats into fatty acids, and proteins into amino acids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>. Enzymes are also crucial in fermentation science, as alcohol and glucose cannot be produced without them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>.

## Biotech Industry Beginnings

The speaker's father, a brewmaster, considered brewing the oldest biotechnology known to man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Brewing involves microbiology, genetics, and fermentation science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. This perspective influenced the speaker's decision to pursue a Master's in Brewing in Australia in 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. She was the only woman in her class, highlighting that brewing was traditionally a male-dominated field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

### Challenges in the Industry

Upon returning to India in late 1975 or early 1976, the speaker found it difficult to secure a job as a brewmaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. Breweries were hesitant to hire a woman for a leadership role, citing concerns about hostile labor unions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. This experience made her realize that the country was not yet ready for a woman brewmaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>. These [[challenges_faced_by_women_entrepreneurs_in_the_biotech_industry | gender biases]] in the business world were significant, with few women running large businesses in India during the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.

## Biocon's Genesis and Early Focus on Enzymes

The speaker's journey into biotechnology began with an accidental encounter in 1978 with an Irish biotech entrepreneur, Les Hawkins, who wanted to start a company in India focused on enzyme technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>. Despite her initial diffidence due to lack of business experience and capital, and being a woman in a male-dominated business world, she was convinced to pursue the venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>.

This led to the establishment of Biocon in 1978 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:18">[00:30:18]</a>. The company initially focused on two types of enzyme technologies:
*   **Papain production:** A plant enzyme derived from papaya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.
*   **Solid-state fermentation enzymes:** Important for various enzyme applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>.

The initial funding included an advance payment of 10,000 pounds from the Irish partner as a buyback guarantee for the products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:59">[00:32:59]</a>. Despite this, securing a credit line from banks was challenging due to the unfamiliar nature of the business and gender bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:35">[00:33:35]</a>. Biocon started frugally in a garage shed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:22">[00:32:22]</a>, with its first two employees being retired tractor mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>. The company gained recognition after being featured in "Business World" and "India Today," attracting young engineers and professionals from institutions like IIT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>.

## Environmental Benefits of Enzyme Technologies

Biocon's early purpose was to replace chemical technologies with enzyme technologies, aiming for the "greening of processes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>. Chemicals contribute to pollution, while bio transformation or biocatalysis using enzymes are eco-friendly, non-polluting, and biodegradable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>. In the early days, this was an idea ahead of its time, as sustainability and green technologies were not widely discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a>. Companies were reluctant to adopt enzyme technologies due to perceived higher costs, not accounting for the expense of treating chemical waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>.

## Transition to Biopharmaceuticals

In 2000, Biocon decided to pivot from enzymes to biopharmaceuticals, recognizing that enzymes alone would limit its growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:12">[00:53:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>. This [[biocons_business_strategy_and_evolution | strategic decision]] was based on leveraging existing enzyme technologies for new applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:53">[00:53:53]</a>. A biopharmaceutical is a pharmaceutical product produced from a life science origin, using living organisms to produce and extract molecules, unlike chemical synthesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:54">[00:54:54]</a>.

Biocon became a major player in the production of:
*   **Statins:** Cholesterol-reducing drugs. The company started with Lovastatin, produced from fungal fermentation, and is now the largest Statin producer globally, with a 50% market share of Statin APIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:24">[00:55:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:57">[00:55:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:37">[00:56:37]</a>. In the U.S. market, Biocon holds a 40% share in atorvastatin and rosuvastatin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:49">[00:56:49]</a>.
*   **Immunosuppressants:** Products like Tacrolimus and Everolimus, used by transplant patients to prevent organ rejection. Biocon also holds a significant 50% dominance in the raw material and finished product for these globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:30">[00:57:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:06">[00:58:06]</a>.

### Recombinant Human Insulin

A significant milestone was the development of recombinant human insulin starting in 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:04">[01:00:04]</a>. At the time, India, being an epicenter of diabetes, heavily relied on imported animal insulins, which were cheaper but inferior to recombinant human insulin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:39">[00:58:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>. Recombinant human insulin is produced by inserting the genetic sequence of insulin into bacteria or yeast, which then produce the protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:07">[00:59:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:24">[00:59:24]</a>.

In 2004, Biocon launched India's first recombinant human insulin using its proprietary technology, significantly driving down prices and making it affordable to patients, effectively replacing animal insulins in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:17">[01:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:35">[01:00:35]</a>. This pivot required challenging oneself to reinvent and anticipate market needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:25">[01:01:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:42">[01:01:42]</a>.

## Future of Biotechnology and Health

The speaker believes that the future of the industry lies in continuously challenging oneself to reinvent and look for "what next" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:25">[01:01:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:27">[01:01:27]</a>. This includes investing in "embedded risk" and adopting a differentiated approach rather than opting for low-risk ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:52">[01:08:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:05">[01:09:05]</a>.

Emerging areas in biotechnology that offer limitless opportunities include:
*   **CRISPR Technologies:** Gene editing technology, which is finding new applications in mRNA technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:44">[01:46:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:15">[01:47:15]</a>. Gene editing can be used to correct genetic deficiencies in babies, improving their life stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:32">[01:48:32]</a>.
*   **mRNA Vaccines:** An mRNA cancer vaccine for pancreatic cancer has shown promising results with 50% of patients cancer-free after one year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:53">[01:52:53]</a>.
*   **Cell and Gene Therapy:** Companies like Immuneel are developing Car T-cell therapy for untreatable blood cancers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:21">[01:49:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:32">[01:49:32]</a>.
*   **Genomic Mapping:** Companies like Mapmygenome are working in this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:51">[01:49:51]</a>.
*   **Anti-microbial Resistant Antibiotics:** Bugworks is developing these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:29">[01:50:29]</a>.
*   **Precision and Personalized Medicine:** This is a key area of focus for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:23">[01:53:23]</a>.

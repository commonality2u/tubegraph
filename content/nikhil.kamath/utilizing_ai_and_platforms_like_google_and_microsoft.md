For young entrepreneurs, a recommended approach involves leveraging existing [[applications_and_future_of_ai|AI]] capabilities and platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Recommended Strategy for Entrepreneurs

One piece of advice for young entrepreneurs is to "pick some [[applications_and_future_of_ai|AI]] thing" and utilize platforms provided by major tech companies like Google and Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This suggests building solutions *on top* of established [[the_role_of_ai_in_the_future|AI]] infrastructure rather than developing foundational [[the_role_of_ai_in_the_future|AI]] technology from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Alternative Approach: Foundational AI

While building on existing platforms is suggested, there is also acknowledgement for those bold enough to pursue foundational [[the_role_of_ai_in_the_future|AI]] pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This implies a more ambitious path of creating core [[the_role_of_ai_in_the_future|AI]] technologies rather than applying them to specific problems using existing tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

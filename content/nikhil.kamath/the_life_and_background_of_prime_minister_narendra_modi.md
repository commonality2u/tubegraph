His life and background shaped his approach to leadership, emphasizing mission over ambition and a continuous striving for national progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.

## Early Life and Education

Narendra Modi was born and raised in Vadnagar, a small town in the Mehsana district of North Gujarat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. During his childhood, Vadnagar had a population of around 15,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. As a child, he recalls being an "average student" in school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>. His early education took place in a primary school built by the Gaekwad State, which instilled an urge for education in the village <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>. The village was known for having a pond, a post office, and a library <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>. He learned to swim in the village pond and even washed clothes for his family there to gain permission to go to the pond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>. He later attended Bhagavatacharya Narayanacharya High School (BN High School), which was a charitable institution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>.

While he wasn't interested in competitive exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>, he was very active in other pursuits and had a knack for instantly grasping new things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:00">[10:34:00]</a>. His teacher, Velji Bhai, saw talent in him, despite his seemingly nonsensical activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>. He was also inspired by his PT teacher, Mr. Parmar, and regularly practiced wrestling and stool pillar exercises, waking up at 5 AM for practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:01:00">[19:01:00]</a>. His proficiency in Hindi, despite being from Gujarat, stemmed from interacting with buffalo traders from other provinces at the railway station where he sold tea as a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:12">[01:51:12]</a>.

## Influences and Early Experiences

Modi's early life was influenced by various figures and circumstances:
*   **Historical Connection**: His village, Vadnagar, was historically significant, having been visited by the Chinese philosopher Yuan Chwang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>. This connection was highlighted when Chinese President Xi Jinping expressed a desire to visit Vadnagar upon Modi becoming Prime Minister in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>.
*   **Community Engagement**: He was inspired by Lover Bhai Dave Kar, a local Congress leader with socialist views, who encouraged children to collect stones with carvings, hinting at the village's ancient history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>.
*   **Leaving Home**: Modi left home at a very young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:00">[10:52:00]</a>. This early departure meant a significant gap in contact with his childhood friends and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>.
*   **Reconnection as CM**: Upon becoming Chief Minister, he wished to reconnect with his school friends, inviting about 30-35 people to his CM house to show them he was still the same person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>. He also publicly honored all his teachers, from primary school to high school, viewing it as a moment of great satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:27:00">[13:27:00]</a>. Similarly, he invited all his extended family members to his CM house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:36:00">[14:36:00]</a>.
*   **Life as a Teacher**: He considers the challenges and problems of his early life as his "biggest university" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:50:00">[31:50:00]</a>. Witnessing women walk kilometers to fetch water in his childhood instilled in him a determination to provide water access for all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:12:00">[32:12:00]</a>. He stresses that he does not act with bad intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:38:00">[33:38:00]</a>.
*   **Self-Reflection**: Modi practiced a unique form of self-reflection, taking time each year to go to remote places without human presence, mobile phones, or newspapers to meet "himself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:49">[01:10:49]</a>. He recounts an experience in the desert village of Dhor, near the Pakistan border, where a Muslim family showed him profound hospitality. This village, once remote, has since become a major tourist destination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:23">[01:12:23]</a>.

## Philosophy and Approach to Politics

Modi draws parallels between politics and entrepreneurship, highlighting similarities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. He believes that for success in politics, dedication and commitment are paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:12:00">[21:12:00]</a>. A politician must be a partner in people's happiness and sorrow and a good team player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:18:00">[21:18:00]</a>.

*   **Mission Over Ambition**: He emphasizes that individuals entering politics should do so with a mission, not just ambition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:21:00">[23:21:00]</a>. He cites [[family_history_with_mahatma_gandhi | Mahatma Gandhi]] as an example of a leader whose life itself spoke, inspiring the entire country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:11:00">[24:11:00]</a>. Gandhi's communication was so powerful that despite never wearing a cap, the world adopted the "Gandhi cap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:21:00">[25:21:00]</a>.
*   **Sensitivity over Thick Skin**: Contrary to common belief, Modi asserts that sensitive people are needed in politics. While accusations are part of a democracy, one should accept them and stand firm if they are truthful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:28:00">[37:28:00]</a>.
*   **"Nation First"**: His core belief system is "Nation First." All decisions and changes are guided by this singular principle, adapting to new things while letting go of old ones if they serve the nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:07:00">[35:07:00]</a>. He believes idealism is more important than ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:24:00">[36:24:00]</a>.
*   **Risk-Taking and Zero Fear**: Modi claims to have a high risk-taking capacity, stemming from his complete disregard for personal concerns and self-preservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:31">[01:09:31]</a>. He lives by a "one life, one mission" philosophy, free from fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:08">[01:10:08]</a>. He demonstrated this in moments of crisis, such as immediately wanting to visit the police control room or hospital after a bomb blast, despite security concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>, and going to Godhra just three days after becoming an MLA in 2002, despite safety warnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:31">[00:48:31]</a>.
*   **"Minimum Government, Maximum Governance"**: This motto, for Modi, is not about reducing ministers or employees but about streamlining processes. He highlights the removal of around 400 compliances and 1500 burdensome laws to make governance efficient and accessible to the common person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:29">[01:29:29]</a>.
*   **Technology in Governance**: He champions the use of technology like India Stack (UPI, Aadhaar, e-KYC) for direct benefit transfer, which has prevented corruption and empowered the common man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:22">[01:31:22]</a>.
*   **Perception of India**: Modi asserts that India's global profile has grown due to the positive image of the Indian diaspora and their law-abiding nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:01">[01:37:01]</a>. He views every Indian abroad as an ambassador <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:20">[01:36:20]</a>. He reflects on how young Indians today are more inclined to build in India rather than pursuing careers abroad, a significant shift from 20-25 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:36">[01:38:36]</a>.
*   **Global Credibility**: India's credibility in international affairs, particularly during crises like the Ukraine-Russia conflict, stems from its clear stance of not being neutral but being "in favor of peace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:31">[01:42:31]</a>. He recounted instances like the evacuation of Indian (and even Pakistani and Bangladeshi) nationals during the Corona crisis and the Nepal earthquake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:42">[01:43:42]</a>.
*   **Empowering the Next Generation**: Modi believes in preparing people for the future. He emphasizes the need for young people to enter public life, not just electoral politics, but to serve the country with creative thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:02">[02:00:02]</a>. He actively encourages women to enter politics, citing the 50% reservation in local bodies and upcoming 30% reservation in MLA and MP seats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:22">[02:02:22]</a>. He envisions a developed India by 2047, driven by "Aspirational India," focusing on 100% delivery of government schemes without discrimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:17">[01:58:17]</a>.

Modi's life reflects a deep understanding of human connection and a disciplined approach to public service, believing that true power comes not from position, but from the ability to connect with and serve the people.

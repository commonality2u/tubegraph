The relationship between India and New Zealand is characterized by a desire for closer ties, cultural exchange, and growing economic opportunities.

## New Zealand Prime Minister's Visit to India

New Zealand's Prime Minister, Chris Hipkins, undertook a "magical" four to five-day visit to India, during which he met with the Indian Prime Minister, visited a Gurudara, and attended a cricket game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Hipkins brought the largest delegation of any New Zealand Prime Minister to India, which included a significant business delegation and a community delegation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

### Historical Perspective
Prime Minister Hipkins' connection to India dates back to his mid-to-late 20s when he worked at Uni Lever, which had a large business presence in India known as Hindustan Lever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. He finds [[indias_geopolitical_and_economic_landscape | India]] to be an inspiring, ambitious, aspirational, and positive nation, noting its trajectory of growth, energy, drive, and determination as "contagious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. He emphasized that India and New Zealand are "two great countries that should have a closer relationship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

## Cultural Exchange

A key aspect of strengthening the relationship is through [[cultural_exchanges_and_indigenous_culture_of_new_zealand | cultural exchanges]]. The New Zealand delegation included an indigenous kapahaka (Māori performing arts) team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. The Prime Minister highlighted the appreciation for Māori culture in India, drawing parallels to India's own thousands of years of civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Such exchanges are seen as vital for making "human connections" and fostering "people-to-people level" relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. The kapahaka team was scheduled to perform in front of the Taj Mahal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

## Economic and Investment Ties

New Zealand is actively seeking to deepen its economic relationship with India. Recent initiatives include a gathering in New Zealand where 107 organizations from 16 countries, representing $6.5 trillion in investment capital, were invited to explore opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>.

To attract [[investment_trends_and_opportunities_in_india | investment]], New Zealand has launched an "active investor visa." This visa provides a pathway to residency in three years for individuals investing $5 million New Zealand Dollars into the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>. This visa offering is not available in countries like the UK or Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>. Despite its geographical distance, New Zealand is an "outward-looking people," with one-fifth of its population living overseas on any given day, underscoring its engagement with the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>.

## Cricket Rivalry
A lighthearted aspect of the relationship is the [[new_zealand_cricket | cricket]] rivalry between the two nations. The Prime Minister joked about the topic after the host mentioned the India New Zealand cricket final, recalling a recent 3-0 whitewash test series in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>. He also mentioned playing cricket at a stadium in Mumbai with Ajaz Patel, a New Zealander who is a "son of Mumbai" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. The sheer dominance of Indian supporters in a recent match, with 49,950 out of 50,000 wearing blue t-shirts, highlighted the passion for cricket in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.

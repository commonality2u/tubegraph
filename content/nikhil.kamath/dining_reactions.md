## Food Items

A [[favorite_dishes | favorite dish]] identified by one participant was "Kima" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

The food was attributed to "Fzy Cafe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

A dessert was also served, described as "level 10 just to trick everybody" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This dessert contained unexpected ingredients, specifically red ants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, which was initially speculated to be a grasshopper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

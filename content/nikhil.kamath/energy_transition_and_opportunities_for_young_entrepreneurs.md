The [[green_businesses_and_economic_transition | energy transition]] presents significant opportunities for [[entrepreneurship_among_young_adults | young entrepreneurs]], particularly over the next decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. Deep innovation is required across many areas due to the broad sources of emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

## Key Areas for Climate Innovation

Entrepreneurs looking to contribute to climate innovation can focus on approximately 20 different areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. These include:

*   **Electricity Generation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>
    *   Improving solar cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>
    *   Making offshore wind cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>
    *   Advancements in nuclear fission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>
    *   Developing nuclear fusion, which could potentially be the cheapest source of electricity in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>
*   **Agricultural Space** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>
    *   Addressing emissions from rice through new genetics and direct seeding methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>
    *   Innovations related to livestock, such as vaccinating or changing the genetics of cows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>
*   **Industrial Sector** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>
    *   Developing cheap green hydrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>
    *   Changing industrial processes, such as using electricity instead of coal for steel reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>

## Pathways for Young Entrepreneurs

Many breakthroughs in [[green_businesses_and_economic_transition | climate innovation]] are expected to come from [[entrepreneurship_and_startup_success | startups]], often in collaboration with larger companies, rather than directly from established corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.

### Finding Initial Support

For [[entrepreneurship_among_young_adults | young entrepreneurs]] without significant initial capital, finding a philanthropist can be an ideal starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>. The Breakthrough Energy fund, for example, offers a fellows program that provides [[nondilutive_grants_for_young_entrepreneurs | grants]] for early-stage ideas without requiring a business plan upfront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.

### Accessing Risk Capital

After the initial grant stage, specialized Venture Capital groups are available to fund high-risk Climate Technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. There is a growing network of such investors, including Breakthrough Energy, actively seeking promising ideas, particularly in regions like India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. This period is favorable for seeking risk capital if an idea is attractive and could have a significant impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>.

## Advice for Aspiring Entrepreneurs

If a 25-year-old in India with about $100,000 in capital were to start a business today, a strong recommendation would be to build an AI-related application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>. This would involve:

*   Utilizing existing platforms like Google or Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>.
*   Maintaining close contact with customers to continuously improve data and stay ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>.
*   Identifying and targeting the most demanding customers for a particular service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>.

Such an approach could contribute to solutions like clearing legal backlogs, which in turn benefits overall business activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>. This [[advice_for_young_entrepreneurs | advice]] highlights the potential for combining technological advancement with market needs to drive impactful [[entrepreneurship_and_youth_mentorship | entrepreneurship and youth mentorship]].

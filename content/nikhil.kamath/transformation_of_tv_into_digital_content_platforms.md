The question of whether "old school media" is dying and creators will take over is considered to have been answered already <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. A core principle for any business is that if it doesn't transform itself every five to seven years, it is likely to fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The average lifespan of a company on the S&P 500 index is 15 years, suggesting that all businesses are, in a sense, "destined to die" if they don't adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Evolution of Newspapers
Newspapers were historically the primary means for people to access information, liberating society at many levels from more dictatorial environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. However, global newspaper readership and print circulation are declining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Smart companies are adapting by moving content behind paywalls and offering premium content, with examples like The Economist and The New York Times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Newspapers must transform their models to be digitally driven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This demonstrates the [[evolution_of_newspapers_in_the_digital_era | evolution of newspapers in the digital era]].

## [[television_and_media | Television and Media]]'s Digital Transformation
[[television_and_media | Television and media]] are viewed with more optimism because they inherently work with digital platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **Smart TVs:** TVs are rapidly becoming digital devices, with most now being Android, Apple, or smart TVs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   **Shift from Broadcast to IP:** Broadcast television is expected to cease, with content moving entirely to IP-based delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. For example, Business Today launched an IP-based TV channel accessible via an app, distinct from YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Personalized Content:** The trend is towards personalized content, where viewers choose exactly what they watch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This is a significant shift from a time when only a few channels were available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Now, consumers can subscribe to specific channels, and many will only discover content through their personalized feeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. This contributes to [[the_rise_of_personalized_content_and_ott_platforms | the rise of personalized content and OTT platforms]].
*   **[[trends_in_media_and_content_consumption | Trends in media and content consumption]]:** The shift in media consumption is evident in the decline of traditional movie-going experiences, where a Friday movie release no longer dominates public attention as it once did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Short-form content platforms like TikTok are seen as "micro Bollywood movies," reflecting [[current_digital_universes_on_smartphones | current digital universes on smartphones]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

## Rise of Digital Content Creators
The entertainment landscape has fragmented, with a single star like Shahrukh Khan no longer being the sole focus for three-hour movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Now, millions of talented individuals can entertain audiences for 30 seconds via short video apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

### Lowering Barriers to Entry
Platforms that enable individuals to become "rock stars" have gained prominence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. Over the past decades, the barrier to becoming a prominent figure has consistently lowered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>, beginning with platforms like YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This illustrates [[lower_barriers_to_entry_for_digital_content_creators | lower barriers to entry for digital content creators]].

### Content Creators on OTT Platforms
A strategy for [[the_rise_of_personalized_content_and_ott_platforms | OTT platforms]] to guarantee distribution is to collaborate with creators who already possess an audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. This thesis has proven successful, with examples such as Bhuvan Bam's show, and specials from Zakir Khan and CarryMinati trending highly on platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Even a gamer with 12 million YouTube followers can host a top podcast on Spotify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. This highlights [[the_journey_of_content_creators_and_their_transitions | the journey of content creators and their transitions]].

The consistent lowering of barriers to entry is a key trend, prompting consideration of what the next development will be where participation becomes universally accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

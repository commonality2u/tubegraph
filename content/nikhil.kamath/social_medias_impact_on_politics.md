Social media has profoundly reshaped the landscape of politics, transforming how information is disseminated, how politicians interact with the public, and how public perception is formed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:02">[00:38:02]</a>.

## Social Media as a Force
The prominence of social media has significantly increased, becoming an influential power in public discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:09">[00:41:09]</a>. This contrasts sharply with a time when it was not as important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:17">[00:38:17]</a>.

### Verification and Transparency
In the past, people often had to accept information presented to them without much opportunity for verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>. For example, if someone claimed a certain number of deaths, there was no easy way to check this information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:35">[00:41:35]</a>. Today, platforms like social media offer alternative paths to verify information, allowing individuals to get closer to the truth with ease, ultimately strengthening democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:39">[00:41:39]</a>. A mobile phone can provide access to all necessary information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:47">[00:41:47]</a>. The youth of today are adept at verifying information online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>.

### Influence on Public Engagement
Social media has become a significant force for the new generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:35">[00:43:35]</a>. It has enabled public engagement on a grand scale, even inspiring interest in complex topics like space missions; for instance, many children are knowledgeable about the Gaganyaan mission's timeline and astronaut training, which is a testament to social media's power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:07]</a>.

## Challenges and Criticisms
Despite its benefits, social media also presents challenges for politicians. Abuse and negative comments are common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:48">[00:38:48]</a>. The advice given to young politicians is not to develop "thick skin" but rather to remain sensitive to people's needs and concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>. Allegations and criticisms are part of a democracy, and if one is truthful and acts without ill intent, these issues should not pose a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:36">[00:37:36]</a>. However, it's acknowledged that distortions and wrongdoings can occur through social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>.

## Communication and Perception
The ability to communicate is crucial in politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>. While traditional oratory is important, the power of communication extends beyond mere words. For example, Mahatma Gandhi, despite his frail physique and lack of traditional political power, inspired the entire nation through his advocacy for non-violence, and his simple act of not wearing a cap led to the widespread adoption of the Gandhi cap, showcasing the profound impact of his communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>.

The perception of a country, or any entity, is also heavily influenced by [[Impact of social media on consumer behavior | marketing]] and communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:54">[01:35:54]</a>. The global perception of India has significantly changed, with a growing sense of honor and trust in the country's profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. This is partly due to the influence of the Indian diaspora worldwide, whose strength is now being leveraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:45">[01:36:45]</a>.

## Encouraging Youth Participation
There's an appeal for youth to enter politics, not just for elections or power, but to engage in public life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:57">[02:03:57]</a>. This means contributing to policy-making and governance, which can bring about significant change across the entire country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:30">[00:58:30]</a>. Politics should be viewed on a much broader canvas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:02">[02:03:02]</a>.

*   **Beyond Elections**: Politics is not solely about elections, defeat, or power; these are just aspects of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:03">[00:58:03]</a>.
*   **Mission-Driven Approach**: Idealistic individuals with a mission should enter politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:07">[02:00:07]</a>. Success in politics requires dedication and commitment to the welfare of people, being a partner in their happiness and sorrow, and being a good team player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.
*   **Addressing Misconceptions**: The notion that politics is a "dirty place" is a pervasive societal belief that needs to be challenged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:49">[00:56:49]</a>. By showing respect to politics, good people will be encouraged to join <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:57">[00:55:57]</a>.
*   **Financial Barriers**: While there's a perception that politics requires a lot of money, historical examples show that individuals can successfully contest elections with minimal financial resources, emphasizing the importance of dedication and trust from society over wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:03">[01:21:03]</a>.
*   **Qualities for Politicians**: While there are minimum age requirements to become a candidate (e.g., 25 for an MLA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:52">[02:00:52]</a>, a "right politician" needs thousands of eyes watching their every move and words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:32">[02:01:32]</a>. This constant scrutiny requires an "unexpected quality" that doesn't come from university certificates, demanding 24/7 consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:54">[02:01:54]</a>.

### Women in Politics
There's a significant push for women to enter politics, especially with reservations in local governing bodies, and future reservations expected at higher levels like MLA and MP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:22">[02:02:22]</a>. This is seen as an opportunity for women to demonstrate leadership qualities and become worthy leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:09">[02:03:09]</a>.

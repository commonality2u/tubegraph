The WTF Fund is a non-dilutive grant established to support young [[entrepreneurship_for_beginners | founders]] aged 25 and under who possess innovative ideas but lack the financial means to execute them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The fund aims to foster [[entrepreneurship_and_startup_success | startup success]] by providing crucial early-stage support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Initially, the fund received 1,500 applications, shortlisting 160, and ultimately presenting nine startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Pille: Addressing Women's Health Concerns

Among the first cohort of funded startups is "Pille," a venture focused on improving women's lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Pille's mission is to "bridge the gap from just managing to solving the period concerns and the discomforts that a woman go through and empowering women in real real sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This initiative directly contributes to [[entrepreneurship_and_women_in_tech | empowering women]] by addressing specific health challenges.

A founder from Jaipur, building "Pixi," found out about the WTF Fund through Nel K's podcast and recognized it as an essential opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This highlights the role of accessible funding and outreach in supporting [[role_of_personal_experiences_in_shaping_entrepreneurial_success | entrepreneurial journeys]], including those of women.

Social media platforms can significantly influence personal relationships, affecting how individuals share their lives and interact with family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Sharing Personal Lives
People often post details of their private lives, such as holiday pictures, on social media, indicating a desire for others to see their experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This act of sharing is described as part of a "vicious cycle" driven by a [[role_of_social_media_in_dopamine_addiction|dopamine hit]] at both the platform and individual user ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Family Dynamics
Social media can become a space for family interactions and expressions, sometimes with personal declarations. For instance, a mother might post publicly on Facebook stating she has "the worst kids in the world" and tag them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Such posts reflect how personal grievances or family dynamics can play out on public platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The concern from parents about platforms their children should avoid also highlights the impact on family relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

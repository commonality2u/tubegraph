The foundation gained significant recognition and funding, receiving 1 Crore rupees from Episode 9 of "The Venture Capitalist One" podcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Founding and Vision

The Join The Dots Foundation was established in 2014 by Danay Ramakrishna, known as DJ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. DJ transitioned from his career at Microsoft to dedicate his efforts to working in rural communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. His initial motivation stemmed from a desire to support students, a common aspiration for non-resident Indians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Upon arriving in India, he identified a significant, untapped opportunity in these areas, confirming this potential by visiting 17 schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### Mission and Vision Statements

The foundation operates with clear objectives:
*   **Mission Statement**: "Every student must become the best version of themselves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Vision**: To support 10,000 students by the end of 2031, enabling them to earn 50 LPA (Lakhs Per Annum), contribute 2% back to the Join The Dots community, and dedicate 10 hours of their time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Key Initiatives and Programs

Join The Dots Foundation implements various programs focused on holistic development:

### Infrastructure and Community Development
The foundation actively invests in improving infrastructure in rural schools. An example is the inauguration of a children's park in Jari Pali, which was made possible with the support of Nikhil Kamath and WTF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

### [[educational_programs_and_funding_at_join_the_dots_foundation | Educational Programs]]
A core focus is on [[educational_programs_and_funding_at_join_the_dots_foundation | educational programs]] designed to transform students' lives. For instance, the foundation rigorously selects students to enter specialized programs, such as training six girls from 34 schools to become software developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. These students learn data structures, algorithms, HTML, and CSS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. After completing their 12th grade, they are provided with a dedicated living and learning environment for three years to master full-stack web development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

### [[sports_and_cultural_development_efforts_in_join_the_dots_foundation | Sports and Cultural Development]]
Under the leadership of Sheila, the Sports Coordinator, Join The Dots Foundation also champions [[sports_and_cultural_development_efforts_in_join_the_dots_foundation | sports development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. They support unique sports like fencing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Culturally, led by Vanani, they foster talent, with over 20 students learning Carnatic music and others learning instruments like the flute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

### [[special_needs_support_initiatives_at_join_the_dots_foundation | Special Needs Support]]

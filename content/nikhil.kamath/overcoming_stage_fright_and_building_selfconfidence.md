Overcoming shyness and building self-confidence, especially in public-facing careers, is a journey that often involves pushing past discomfort and embracing continuous learning. Kriti Sanon, an actress who began her career as a self-described "shy and nerdy kid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a> with stage fright, offers insights into how she transformed her personality and found success in an unconventional field.

## Early Life and Childhood Challenges

Kriti describes herself as a "shy and a studious and a nerdy kid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, feeling the typical "pressure of like doing well in studies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a> common for firstborns. Despite learning Kathak and always being in dance groups, she experienced "extremely shy" moments and "stage fright" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. She would hide behind her mother and take time to open up to people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

Her mother, a professor who "fought to do PhD" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a> and was the first woman in her family to work, instilled in Kriti a drive for academic excellence and a desire to achieve dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. Kriti's mother initially expressed concern about her pursuing a career in acting, noting that the field "requires a lot of like you need to be thick skinned and you need to take pressure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:31">[00:55:31]</a>, given Kriti's initial shyness and tendency to cry when things didn't go well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:48">[00:55:48]</a>.

Even early in her professional journey, Kriti faced significant challenges:
*   Her "first Ram show [she] came back crying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>.
*   Her "first photo shoot [she] came back crying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:25">[00:41:25]</a> because she felt "so conscious" and wasn't performing her best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a>.
*   Her first film audition for *Student Of The Year One* was "horrible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:14">[00:55:14]</a>.

## Strategies for Building Confidence

Kriti attributes her transformation from a shy individual to a confident actress to several key factors:

1.  **Gaining Confidence Through Work:** She found that "I gained confidence with work while working" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:47">[00:41:47]</a>. By continually engaging in her profession, she naturally became more comfortable.
2.  **Seeking Uncomfortable Situations:** Kriti actively "keep[s] putting [herself] in situations that [she's] scared of" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:52">[00:41:52]</a>. This deliberate exposure to challenges, like giving a global speech, helps her "surpass that" and "gain that confidence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>. She notes that "scary and exciting is the same emotion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:58">[00:42:58]</a> for her professionally.
3.  **Persistence and Not Giving Up:** Despite initial setbacks and crying after poor performances, she "kept working and learning and asking questions and figuring and I got better with every audition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:26">[00:56:26]</a>. Her mother's advice to be "thick skinned" and "take pressure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:31">[00:55:31]</a>, combined with her own self-belief, motivated her to persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>.
4.  **Embracing Learning and Curiosity:** Being a "learner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:44">[00:49:44]</a>, Kriti is "always asking questions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:12">[00:50:12]</a>. This curiosity, which initially led to some people labeling her as someone who "asked too many questions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:03">[00:50:03]</a>, later became her strength, as "the perception also changes from where you are" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:58">[00:50:58]</a>. Asking questions helps her "keep learning and growing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:16">[00:51:16]</a> and allows her to "be okay with not knowing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:27">[02:23:27]</a>.

## The Role of Talent and Passion

Kriti believes that inherent talent is important, stating, "your natural like I know this might might not like convince your mind cuz you think so deeply but there are like some abilities that you're gifted with that can't be taught right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:36">[01:05:36]</a>. However, she also emphasizes the journey of discovering one's passion: "you have to find your passion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:56">[00:52:56]</a>. While she didn't initially know if she could act or even wanted to, she realized she enjoyed performing in front of a camera and was good at it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:56">[00:53:56]</a>. For Kriti, "actual love for acting happened a little later where I got way deeper into it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:39">[02:15:39]</a>, evolving from initial enjoyment and skill recognition.

## Impact of External Factors and Resilience

Rahul, a cricketer, also shares his experience with confidence and public scrutiny. He describes himself as a "shy softspoken boy growing up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:06">[01:28:06]</a> who became very confident after playing for India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:09">[01:28:09]</a>. However, a highly public and controversial interview and subsequent suspension "scarred me massively" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:37">[01:28:37]</a>, leading him to become less outgoing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:31">[01:30:31]</a>. He learned that "it is easier for me to to be more at peace when I don't give other people the power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:14">[01:31:14]</a> and has reduced his social media engagement to manage trolling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:37">[01:32:37]</a>.

Rahul's advice for aspiring professionals emphasizes:
*   **Self-Belief and Internal Strength:** The "ability to be your own team in the sense you're fighting a lot of battles and if you're strong enough to be able to fight those battles all by yourself and alone not having to lean on anybody" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:55">[01:34:55]</a> helps in the long run.
*   **Patience and Hard Work:** "patience and hard work over a long period of time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:18">[02:37:18]</a> are crucial.

Ultimately, overcoming stage fright and building confidence is a process of repeatedly stepping out of one's comfort zone, learning from experiences, persisting through setbacks, and fostering a strong sense of self-belief and purpose.

This emphasizes the strategic importance of data sovereignty for technological leadership in health.

## Ethical Frameworks for AI in Healthcare
A philosophical framework, known as "Don't Die," proposes that [[understanding_ai|AI]] should be aligned with principles that promote life preservation, such as preventing harm to individuals and the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This framework suggests a moral and social imperative for [[the_impact_of_artificial_intelligence_on_society|AI's development]] and application in ensuring human well-being and survival within a broader societal context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

The digital landscape is rapidly evolving, giving rise to new forms of celebrity and influence, notably through [[the_role_and_impact_of_social_media_influencers | virtual influencers]] and their associated virtual identities. These digital entities challenge traditional notions of celebrity and content creation, offering unique avenues for engagement and monetization.

## The Rise of Virtual Influencers

Virtual influencers are computer-generated characters designed to emulate human [[the_impact_of_social_media_and_influencer_culture | influencers]], interacting with audiences across various social media platforms. They are carefully curated characters with distinct personalities, backstories, and aesthetics.

### Kyra: India's First Virtual Influencer
Himanshu, the creator of India's first virtual influencer, Kyra, explains the strategic decisions behind her creation.
*   **Neutral Identity**: Kyra was given a neutral name without a surname to avoid political or religious affiliations, aiming for the widest possible audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:56">[00:56:56]</a>. A South Indian virtual influencer named Shravya was also recently launched, chosen for being a trending name in the South <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:08">[00:57:08]</a>.
*   **Gender Strategy**: Creating a female virtual influencer in India, given the male-dominated internet population, was a deliberate choice to attract more followers and viewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:42">[00:57:42]</a>. Initially, Kyra's audience was 90% male, but targeted marketing, including through meme pages, shifted the ratio to 70% male and 30% female <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:43">[00:58:43]</a>.
*   **Origin Story and Presence**: Kyra's backstory dictates that she "came from the metaverse" to the human world in January 2022, having lost her memories and is now on a journey to rediscover them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:27">[00:59:27]</a>. While theoretical, Kyra can exist in any metaverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:21">[00:59:21]</a>. She has been featured in Decentraland and the MG Motors' "MGverse" for the Auto Expo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:47">[00:59:47]</a>.
*   **Interactivity**: Currently, Kyra's interactions are curated, without direct interactivity, though a voice actress is used for her speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:04">[01:00:04]</a>. The next step is to make her semi-autonomous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:13">[01:00:13]</a>.
*   **Monetization**: Kyra makes money through brand partnerships, having worked with six brands with more requests than production capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:19">[01:00:19]</a>. With 200,000 followers on Instagram, she is also working on a music album for YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:37">[01:00:37]</a>. Lil Miquela, a US-based virtual influencer, has 3 million followers and music videos with millions of views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:56">[01:00:56]</a>.

## The Appeal of Virtual Identities

Despite being digital creations, [[impact_of_social_media_on_personal_identity | virtual influencers]] resonate with audiences due to their ability to tell compelling stories.

> "It's character in storytelling, right? It's like saying Harry Potter isn't real then why are there potterheads? It's like saying Sherlock Holmes isn't real why are we watching them?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:30">[01:01:30]</a>

Social media platforms act as a medium for building these stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">[01:01:43]</a>. This approach suggests that the authenticity of the character's narrative, rather than their physical existence, drives engagement.

## Technology Enabling Virtual Identities

The creation and deployment of virtual influencers rely heavily on advanced technology.

*   **Unreal Engine**: This powerful game engine is crucial for creating realistic 3D characters and environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:44">[01:03:44]</a>. Unreal Engine's "MetaHumans" feature allows for the generation of incredibly realistic human avatars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>.
*   **AI and Automation**: AI, particularly large language models like GPT, can generate programs and content based on instructions, leading to professions like "prompt engineers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:21">[01:05:21]</a>. This technology can streamline content creation for virtual identities.
*   **Digital Twins**: The concept of a "digital twin" suggests that virtual versions of real-world objects and places can be created, enabling immersive experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:22">[01:07:22]</a>. Tools like "Nerf" (Neural Radiance Field) allow for the capture of real-world spaces into 3D models using just a smartphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:35">[01:07:35]</a>.

## Impact on Traditional Influencers and the Future of Work

The rise of [[role_of_influencers_in_modern_marketing | virtual influencers]] introduces a new dynamic to the [[life_and_work_of_social_media_creators | creator economy]].

When Kyra was the face of a campaign for a brand, it likely replaced a human influencer who would have otherwise been chosen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:27">[01:04:27]</a>. This development hints at a future where AI and virtual entities could take over roles traditionally held by human creators.

> "With most of technology it's like it's almost there almost there almost there and then one day it's like wink it's like all right all right now I have your job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>

The increasing sophistication of AI and virtual creation tools suggests a shift in the nature of work, where "AI operators" or "prompt engineers" become valuable professions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:54">[01:04:54]</a>.

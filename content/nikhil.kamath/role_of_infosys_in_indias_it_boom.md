Infosys played a foundational role in India's Information Technology (IT) boom, particularly in establishing Bangalore as a prominent tech city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>. It is regarded as the "original startup" from which many other entrepreneurs emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.

## Founding and Vision
Infosys was founded in 1981 under the leadership of Mr. N.R. Narayana Murthy, with Nandan as one of the co-founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. The company began its journey in Bombay and Pune, relocating to Bangalore in 1983 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.

The founders' synergistic approach and common values, including a long-term vision and high standards of corporate governance, distinguished Infosys from prevalent family or politically-linked businesses of the era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>. Their ambition was to build a globally respected company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.

## Impact on Scale and Entrepreneurship
Nandan describes Infosys as a "great learning journey in scale," specifically in "Enterprise scale" as opposed to "population scale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>. The company significantly contributed to Bangalore's evolution through various technology curves, including hardware, software, and the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. Beyond its own growth, Infosys is credited with inspiring and fostering a new generation of entrepreneurs in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.

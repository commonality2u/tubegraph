The Liv love laugh Foundation, an organization committed to [[mental_health_and_its_importance | mental health]] awareness and support, received an amount of 75 lakh rupees through a podcast session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:07">[02:04:07]</a>. Anisha, representing the foundation, stated that the organization won between 75 lakhs to a crore for that particular session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:10">[02:07:10]</a>.

## Allocation of Funds

The funds will primarily be used for scaling the foundation's rural mental health program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:30">[09:13:30]</a>. This decision was made to expand their reach and impact in rural areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:57">[08:53:57]</a>.

## The Rural Mental Health Program

The Liv love laugh Foundation has been operating its rural mental health program since 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59:01">[08:59:01]</a>. The model for this program is well-established, allowing for significant scaling this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:46">[09:01:46]</a>. The foundation conducted its first rural visit to Davangere in October 2017 to commemorate World Mental Health Day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:04">[01:33:04]</a>.

### [[challenges_in_addressing_mental_health_in_rural_india | Challenges in Addressing Mental Health in Rural India]]

Addressing [[mental_health_and_its_importance | mental health]] in rural India presents unique [[challenges_in_addressing_mental_health_in_rural_india | challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:30">[05:51:30]</a>. Unlike urban centers where there might be more discussion around it, rural communities often lack understanding of [[mental_health_and_its_importance | mental illness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:39">[05:57:39]</a>. There is a prevalent belief in faith healers and black magic, which complicates intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:22">[06:26:22]</a>. Instances of severe [[mental_health_and_its_importance | mental illness]] in rural areas can lead to aggressive behavior, sometimes resulting in individuals being physically restrained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:09">[06:35:09]</a>.

To tackle these issues, the foundation employs a community-based model for its rural program, focusing on supporting, making aware, and empowering the larger community rather than individualistic approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:40">[06:51:40]</a>.

## Vision and Impact

The core belief of the Liv love laugh Foundation is that no life should be lost due to [[mental_health_and_its_importance | mental illness]], especially given India's high suicide rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:04">[03:34:04]</a>. Their vision is to provide hope to those experiencing stress, anxiety, and depression, particularly in times when there appears to be no hope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:07">[03:48:07]</a>. The scaling of the rural program aligns with this vision, aiming to reach a wider, more diverse audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:20">[04:24:20]</a>.

The foundation categorizes its efforts into three key areas:
-   **Awareness** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:40">[04:41:40]</a>
-   **Accessibility** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:59">[04:45:59]</a>
-   **Affordability** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:04">[04:47:04]</a>

All programs and initiatives fall under these three buckets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:09">[04:50:09]</a>. The approach is tailored to the target audience; for example, digital mediums are used for urban dwellers who consume social media, while different interventions are necessary for a 45-year-old man in rural India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:04">[05:14:04]</a>.

The most fulfilling achievements for the foundation are the individual transformations witnessed in people's lives through their work, whether in rural or urban settings. This is seen as the biggest success, more so than awards or recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:09">[07:49:09]</a>.

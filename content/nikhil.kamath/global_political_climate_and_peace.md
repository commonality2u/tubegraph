The current global climate is characterized by a prevailing movement towards conflict. There is a sense that the "whole world is moving towards war," which should be a cause for concern regarding global events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Stance on International Crises
In the face of global crises, a consistent position has been maintained: "we are not neutral" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. The stated stance is unequivocally "in favor of peace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Public Perception of Politics
A significant challenge to engaging with [[global_political_dynamics_and_resilience | political dynamics]] is the deep-seated public perception of politics. For instance, individuals growing up in South Indian middle-class families were often told from childhood that "politics is a dirty place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This negative view has become "so ingrained in our psyche that it is very difficult to change it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This [[public_perception_and_cultural_influence_on_climate_action | public perception]] impacts engagement with and understanding of political processes.

## Qualities of Politicians
There is a call for "good people" to continually enter politics, emphasizing that they should come with a "mission not with ambition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Leadership requires humility and acknowledging one's human fallibility, as expressed by a Chief Minister who admitted, "I too must be making mistakes, I am also a human being, I am not some god" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

### Political Development
The evolution of a political term involves mutual understanding between leaders and the populace. In a first term, there is a period where "people used to try to understand me as well and I was also trying to understand Delhi" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

Virtual influencers are 3D-created characters that exist digitally and serve as brand faces and content creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:13">[00:59:13]</a>. They represent a new frontier in [[role and future prospects of social media influencers|social media influence]] and [[influencerled brand strategies|marketing strategies]].

## Development and Characteristics

Himanshu created India's first virtual influencer, named Kaira <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:46">[00:56:46]</a>. The name "Kaira" was chosen to be neutral, avoiding political or religious connotations, to appeal to the broadest possible audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:56">[00:56:56]</a>. A team of [[the role of brands in content creation|content creators]] is responsible for selecting such names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:22">[00:57:22]</a>. More recently, a South Indian virtual influencer named Shravya was launched, based on currently trending names in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:08">[00:57:08]</a>.

Kaira's backstory involves her arriving from the metaverse to our world in January 2022, having lost her memories and now on a journey to rediscover them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:26">[00:59:26]</a>. Her original metaverse has not yet been revealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:41">[00:59:41]</a>.

Currently, Kaira's content is static and curated, with a voice provided by a voice actress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:05">[01:00:05]</a>. The next step in her development is to make her semi-autonomous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:13">[01:00:13]</a>.

## Audience and Engagement

The decision to create a female virtual influencer like Kaira was partly strategic, as male audiences on the internet in India are more likely to follow a female character for viewership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:32">[00:57:32]</a>. Instagram audience insights for female influencers often show a male-dominated split <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:15">[00:58:15]</a>. Initially, Kaira's audience was 90% male <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:43">[00:58:43]</a>. Through targeted marketing, including leveraging meme pages with millions of followers, the male-to-female ratio was shifted to 70% male and 30% female <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:47">[00:58:47]</a>.

The appeal of virtual influencers lies in character and storytelling, similar to fictional characters like Harry Potter or Sherlock Holmes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:30">[01:01:30]</a>. Social media acts as a platform for building out these stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">[01:01:43]</a>.

## Monetization and Industry Impact

Virtual influencers primarily generate revenue through brand partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:19">[01:00:19]</a>. Kaira, with 200,000 followers on Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:37">[01:00:37]</a>, has collaborated with six brands, including MG Motors for their MG Verse at the Auto Expo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:22">[01:00:22]</a>. The demand for virtual influencers is high, exceeding current production capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:25">[01:00:25]</a>.

Virtual influencers often have a music angle, with some, like the US-based Lil Miquela (3 million followers), releasing music albums and videos that garner millions of views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:56">[01:00:56]</a>. Kaira is also working on a music album for YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:46">[01:00:46]</a>.

The emergence of virtual influencers can lead to them replacing human influencers in campaigns, as seen with Kaira becoming the face of a campaign for a brand's ANC neckband <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:27">[01:04:27]</a>.

## Technology and Future Integration

Virtual influencers, being 3D-created characters, can theoretically exist in any metaverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:21">[00:59:21]</a>. They have been experimented with in platforms like Decentraland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:48">[00:59:48]</a>. The creation of these characters and their environments often utilizes powerful game engines like Unreal Engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:44">[01:03:44]</a>. While animation pipelines might offer more photorealistic results, Unreal Engine is catching up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:52">[01:03:52]</a>.

The goal is to focus on storytelling rather than competing directly with large 3D companies in terms of billions of dollars in development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:02">[01:04:02]</a>. The use of AI is also significant, with tools like Nerf (Neural Radiance Field) allowing for the creation of 3D environments from smartphone captures, making the concept of a "digital twin" of the real world more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:17">[01:07:17]</a>.

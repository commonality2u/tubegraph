The journey of [[kiran_mazumdar_shaw_and_her_journey_in_biotech | Kiran Mazumdar Shaw]] into the world of [[kiran_mazumdar_shaws_journey_into_biotechnology | biotechnology]] and [[entrepreneurship_and_nikhil_kamath | entrepreneurship]] was significantly influenced by early advice and supportive relationships, highlighting the [[role_of_personal_experiences_in_shaping_entrepreneurial_success | role of personal experiences]] and [[role_of_cultural_and_family_background_in_career_choices | cultural and family background]] in shaping her path.

## Early Influence: Father's Guidance

A pivotal moment in Kiran's career trajectory came from an unexpected suggestion from her late father. He advised her to consider brewing as a profession, stating, "why don't you do Brewing like I did?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Though Kiran initially reacted with surprise, asking "Are you nuts I said I'm a woman how will I do too" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, this advice, given in Bangalore many years ago, likely planted the seed for her eventual foray into business, even if it led her down a different path to starting a "strange business called biotech" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Her initial venture into Biocon was characterized by "foolish courage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, but the idea of starting a business was introduced by her father.

## Supportive Relationships

Throughout her [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_advice_for_young_aspiring_entrepreneurs | entrepreneurial journey]], Kiran also fostered significant supportive relationships:

*   **Vijay Mallya:** Vijay Mallya consistently viewed Kiran as his "elder sister" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, indicating a relationship of respect and perhaps a form of informal mentorship or guidance that Kiran provided or was seen to embody.
*   **John Shaw (Husband):** Her husband, John Shaw, played a supportive role, humorously acknowledging his financial contribution to her success. He often joked, "I always thought I'd get a dowry but Kiran cleaned me out but that was the best investment I ever made" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This highlights a partnership built on trust and mutual investment, which contributed to her ability to navigate [[personal_challenges_and_resilience_in_career | personal challenges]] and maintain her drive. Her ability to remain "resilient... in the face of adversity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a> and "not lose that drive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a> was partly supported by such relationships.

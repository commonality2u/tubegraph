Local breweries and brands like Gua Brewing play a significant role in the [[craft_beverages_industry | craft beverages industry]] by focusing on specific market niches and consumer needs. Working in an alcohol agency can lead to people looking at you very differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Gua Brewing's Philosophy

The core philosophy of Gua Brewing is to create beer that is suitable for a home refrigerator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This approach suggests a focus on accessibility and integration into everyday consumer habits.

## Indian Brands in the Global Market

The current thesis in the industry is to see Indian brands succeed internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This ambition is underscored by the success of larger Indian beverage companies:

> Radico reported a turnover of approximately 4,200 crore last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Its market capitalization is close to 22-23,000 crore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The company has been recognized on global lists, including the world's list and Asia's list, and has been ranked number one in India for three consecutive years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## High-Value Market Segment

The market also includes highly prized and expensive alcoholic beverages. For instance, a bottle of Yamazaki 55 retailed for six and a half crore rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This demonstrates that there is a segment of consumers who purchase such high-value items, treating them similarly to art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

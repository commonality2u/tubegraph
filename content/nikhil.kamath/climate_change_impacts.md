Observations indicate that the state of the Antarctic sea ice is significantly off, with "things are way out of whack" when looking at its graphs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

Globally, the current period has been identified as "the warmest year on record" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

The natural background extinction rate has been dramatically exceeded, with the current rate being "thousand times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a> higher than the natural background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

The urgency to act on [[understanding_climate_change_and_its_impact | climate change]] is highlighted, as there is no time "to lose another decade in sweet nothingness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

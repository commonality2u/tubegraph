## Growth and Engagement

[[the_growth_and_challenges_of_the_gaming_industry_in_india | Gaming in India]] has grown "by leaps and bounds" compared to the pace of other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

*   Conversely, they are spending less time watching traditional television and, "strangely," less time watching sports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

### Esports Development
The [[esports_in_india | Indian Esports]] scene has not yet achieved a breakout moment comparable to India's 1983 cricket victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Content Creation

When considering [[entrepreneurship and innovation | innovative business strategies]], two distinct approaches are highlighted for aspiring entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Leveraging Existing Platforms

One strategy involves building upon established technological infrastructures. Young entrepreneurs are advised to "pick some AI thing and just use the Google Microsoft platforms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This approach suggests that an [[innovative_health_business_opportunities | innovative business]] can be developed by utilizing existing, robust platforms rather than building from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Pursuing Foundational Innovation

A bolder and more challenging [[entrepreneurship_and_business_strategy | business strategy]] involves going after a "foundational piece" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This means attempting to create entirely new core technologies or business models, even if it means challenging dominant players like Bill Gates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This represents a highly [[creative_entrepreneurship | creative]] and disruptive form of [[entrepreneurship and innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

The discussion also posed a hypothetical scenario for a 25-year-old in [[Business strategies in India | India]] with $100,000 to start a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, though the response regarding specific actions remains unstated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

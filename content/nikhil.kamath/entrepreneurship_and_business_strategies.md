The process of building and running a business is considered a highly creative endeavor, requiring significant creativity at all stages, especially as a business scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. [[risktaking in entrepreneurship | Risk-taking]] and efficiency are inherent parts of any business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. As a company grows and scales, more creativity is needed because the "low-hanging fruit" opportunities have been exhausted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. This is when management transitions from a science to an art, requiring out-of-the-box thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

## Personal Journey into Business

The interviewee's desire to join the family business was strong, without any "burning desire" for an alternative career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>. He was fascinated by the conversations his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather had about business situations, setting up new ventures, and managing people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>. This early exposure shaped his aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a>.

His father set a clear agenda for his professional life, insisting he pursue a Chartered Accountancy (CA) and an MBA, stating that otherwise, there would be no role for him in the office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:22">[01:03:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:52">[01:03:52]</a>. This was a difficult period, but he viewed it as a necessary "ticket" to his future ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a>.

The interviewee gained invaluable experience by interning directly with his father, which he describes as a "real-time MBA" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:01">[01:15:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:41">[01:22:41]</a>. This involved sitting through meetings, observing tough situations, and being exposed to various aspects of running different businesses within the group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:29">[01:15:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:03">[01:23:03]</a>. He also spent a year working on the shop floor of a textile mill to understand financial controls and manufacturing processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:51">[01:23:51]</a>.

### The Impact of Liberalization

The liberalization of India in the early 1990s profoundly changed the business landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:20">[01:55:20]</a>. Tariffs decreased, foreign investors entered the market, and competition intensified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:01">[01:56:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:16">[01:56:16]</a>. This shift necessitated a re-evaluation of business strategy and the need for new talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:23">[01:56:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:29">[01:56:29]</a>.

## Modern Business Strategies and Investments

When asked where he would invest a million dollars if starting fresh today, the interviewee highlights two sectors: paints and jewelry retail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:22">[02:01:22]</a>.

*   **Paints:** This industry is transitioning from unorganized to organized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:29">[02:01:29]</a>. Factors like rising real estate, a growing desire for homeownership (driven by the shift from joint to nuclear families), and synergies with existing cement businesses (dealership network) provide a "right to win" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:31">[02:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:55">[02:01:55]</a>.
*   **Jewelry Retail:** Having 25 years of experience in apparel retail, moving into another form of retail is a logical step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:15">[02:02:15]</a>. This sector benefits from an "aspirational India" where people want to "feel good, look good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:39">[02:02:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:47">[02:02:47]</a>. The market is still largely unorganized, with only one major national player, presenting an opportunity for a new business to aim for a leadership position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:50">[02:02:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:02">[02:03:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:17">[02:03:17]</a>. Trust in the brand is also a critical success factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:31">[02:03:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:47">[02:03:47]</a>.

However, he notes that one or two crore rupees (approximately $130,000 to $260,000 USD) is "just not enough to start any business today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:18">[02:05:18]</a>, especially in India where scale is important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:38">[02:05:38]</a>. Ten crore rupees (approx. $1.3 million USD) would be enough for a small jewelry store, potentially focusing on lab-grown or lower-value jewelry to build an affordable, branded experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:46">[02:05:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:02">[02:06:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:21">[02:06:21]</a>.

### The Role of Private Equity and Venture Capital

The interviewee views private equity and venture capital as "very credible way of building assets or building businesses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:23">[01:57:23]</a>. He acknowledges that it's a different world from traditional business, requiring a different skill set, but recognizes it as a "huge source of equity and capital" that can help grow a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:30">[01:57:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:44">[01:57:44]</a>.

### Business Evolution and Delegation

The ability to pivot between different industries (like textiles, cement, and now jewelry and paints) is driven by the opening of "new engines of growth" as India grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:19">[02:09:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:33">[02:11:33]</a>. When a business matures and its growth rates taper, it becomes necessary to invest in new areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:30">[02:11:30]</a>. This strategy is seen as "common business sense" for a conglomerate model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:47">[02:11:47]</a>.

Delegation and trusting people are fundamental principles for managing a large organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:12">[02:12:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:20">[02:12:20]</a>. With limited personal bandwidth, especially for growing businesses, getting experienced people with diverse skill sets on board is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:49">[02:12:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. The desire to grow necessitates energized teams, as there is "no other way out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:11">[02:13:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:14">[02:13:14]</a>. When hiring, he looks for individuals who can handle complexity, are agile learners, and can lead large, diverse teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:25">[02:14:25]</a>. This often involves a "gut feel" and a "leap of faith" based on instinct and experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:12">[02:14:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:48">[02:14:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:59">[02:14:59]</a>.

### The Importance of Hard Work

A strong work ethic, picked up from observing three generations of his family working intensely every day, is considered a "bulwark" of his character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:13">[02:11:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:37">[02:11:37]</a>. He believes there is "no substitute for hard work, for smart hard work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:37">[02:11:37]</a>.

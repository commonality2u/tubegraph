Leading a family business, especially one with a long and storied history, presents a unique set of [[Entrepreneurial Journey and Challenges | challenges]] and responsibilities. The journey involves navigating the complexities of business growth, managing intergenerational dynamics, and upholding a legacy built over decades.

## Early Influences and Upbringing

The speaker recounts a "very happy childhood" characterized by security, laughter, positivity, high energy, and strong family ties, predominantly in Kolkata and Bombay (Mumbai) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. This upbringing provided an "anchor and very strong roots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

A significant influence was the presence of three generations of family members actively involved in the business: his great-grandfather, grandfather, and father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>. He learned much from their dinner table conversations, gaining "a lot of perspective about life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:59:00">[14:59:00]</a>. This period instilled a sense of "self assuredness" and security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:02:00">[15:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:46:00">[15:46:00]</a>. Discipline and a sense of duty were hallmarks of the family atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:16:00">[15:16:00]</a>.

The speaker observed distinct personalities and business approaches across generations:
*   **Great-grandfather:** A product of pre-independent India, instrumental in building Indian industry at the grassroots level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07:00">[16:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:16:00">[17:16:00]</a>.
*   **Grandfather:** Shaped by an era of scarcity due to India's flirtation with socialism, he was more conservative and numbers-driven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:00">[16:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:30:00">[17:30:00]</a>. He maintained a simple lifestyle, exemplified by his few possessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:52:00">[17:52:00]</a>.
*   **Father:** Grew up in liberalized India, possessing a more expansive view on business and a greater willingness to take risks, expanding operations outside the country more aggressively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:59:00">[16:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:01:00">[19:01:00]</a>.

The speaker notes that each family member had a different dynamic with him; his great-grandfather was a "best friend" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:00:00">[20:00:00]</a>, his grandfather was "doting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:14:00">[20:14:00]</a>, and his father was a "tough Taskmaster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:21:00">[20:21:00]</a>.

## The Path to Leadership: Training and Challenges

The speaker's [[transition_from_childhood_to_career_in_a_business_family | transition from childhood to career in a business family]] was heavily influenced by his father, who "pretty much set the agenda for my professional life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:31">[01:03:31]</a>. Despite not enjoying the dry, boring nature of Chartered Accountancy (CA), which had a very low pass percentage (2-3%), he pursued it because his father insisted, stating that without a CA and MBA, there was "no role" for him in the office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:29">[01:02:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:55">[01:03:55]</a>. This period, from roughly 18 years old in 1985, was a "painful three or four four or five years" but ultimately a "ticket to some of the things that I wanted to do in the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:26">[01:16:26]</a>.

He gained a "real-time MBA" by sitting next to his father for 8-9 hours daily, observing him handle diverse situations including tough business dealings, AGMs, hiring, and government issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:01">[01:15:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:41">[01:22:41]</a>. He also spent a year on the shop floor of a textile mill to understand financial controls and manufacturing operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:49">[01:23:49]</a>. This intense, encapsulated learning was likely because his father knew he was "running out of time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:05">[01:23:05]</a>.

## Assuming Responsibility: A Sudden Transition

At 28, his father passed away after a two-year battle with cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:1:33:00">[01:1:33:00]</a>. The immediate feeling was one of "relief for him" due to his immense pain, followed by a sense of emptiness and "big responsibility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:29">[02:29:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:31">[02:30:31]</a>. Work became his "biggest escape" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:52">[02:30:52]</a>, allowing him to carry forward his father's legacy and complete unfinished work, which "blunted the sense of emptiness to a large extent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:04">[02:32:04]</a>.

## Leadership Philosophy and Business Growth

### Creative Business Building
The speaker views building and running a business as an inherently creative endeavor, especially as a business grows and scales. At that stage, "management turns from being a science into an art" requiring "out of the box" thinking and more creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.

### Responsibility to Society
He believes that giving back to society is not philanthropy, but a fundamental responsibility for businesses. Since businesses "take from society and generat[e] a profit," returning a part of it is a "given" and "not a big big deal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:20">[01:51:20]</a>. Corporates are becoming increasingly important stakeholders globally, and with that comes inherent responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. This philosophy is rooted in the "trusteeship" concept espoused by Mahatma Gandhi, where private companies serve collective prosperity rather than solely being emblems of capitalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:40">[01:55:40]</a>.

### Strategic Pivots
The family business has evolved through different eras, from textiles in the 80s and early 90s to new sectors like paints and jewelry retail today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:10">[01:55:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:26">[02:01:26]</a>. This adaptability stems from a deliberate decision to operate as a conglomerate, leveraging strengths in running diverse businesses and seizing opportunities as new spaces opened up in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:42">[02:08:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:02">[02:09:02]</a>.

When considering a pivot, the speaker relies on instinct, feeling when a business is "mature enough" and its growth rates are tapering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:35">[02:10:35]</a>. This prompts investment in "new engines of growth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:33">[02:11:33]</a>.

## Team Building and Trust

With 180,000 employees, the organization operates as "one team" with a common purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08">[01:13:08]</a>. The speaker emphasizes that it is a "people run business," not a family-run one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:13">[02:12:13]</a>. Trust is a "very important factor" in the organization's DNA, necessitating the choice of the right people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:20">[02:12:20]</a>.

When hiring externally, the speaker looks for individuals who can handle complexity, are agile learners, and can lead large, diverse teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:25">[02:14:25]</a>. He relies on "gut feel" and instinct developed through experience with different profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:48">[02:14:48]</a>. Growing the business means having "energized teams" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:11">[02:13:11]</a>, and there is "no substitute for hard work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:37">[02:13:37]</a>.

## Reflections on Leadership

The speaker reflects on his personal growth in leadership, noting that he is a "much easier person today" and "much less likely to lose my cool" compared to ten years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:51">[01:07:51]</a>. He sees getting angry in a corporate context as a loss of control, which he strives to avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:06">[01:09:06]</a>. This control stems from a deep sense of self and an inner conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:15">[01:14:15]</a>.

A key piece of advice for young entrepreneurs is to "do what you love doing," maintain passion, and build a great team, as a team is what truly achieves success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:48">[02:07:48]</a>. Consistency and learning agility are also crucial for adapting to the rapid changes in today's world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:12">[02:18:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:15">[02:18:15]</a>.

The speaker expresses a sense of gratitude for his life, having lived it "quite thoughtfully" and facing more [[professional_challenges_and_setbacks | curve balls]] than he can recount, yet experiencing much positivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:36">[02:15:36]</a>. He doesn't foresee significant regrets at the end of his life, as his choices, including a lack of work-life balance, were deliberate and logical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:15">[02:16:15]</a>.

> "I don't think at this point of time if I was to die be on my death's P bed today I don't think there's anything I'd hugely regret" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:07">[02:16:07]</a>

The essence of his approach to leadership and life is a deep sense of responsibility, a commitment to growth, and the ability to adapt while staying true to core values.

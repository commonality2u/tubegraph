[[Childhood and family influences | Kumar Birla]] describes his early years as a very happy and secure [[Childhood and family influences | childhood]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. It was marked by laughter, a great sense of positivity, high energy, and very close family ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### Early Life and Education
Part of his [[Childhood and family influences | childhood]] was spent in Kolkata, with the remainder in Bombay (Mumbai) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. Holidays were always spent in Kolkata, where the larger family resided, leading him to associate Kolkata more with his [[Childhood and family influences | childhood]] than Bombay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. The family moved to Bombay in 1969 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This secure environment provided him with a strong anchor and roots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. His upbringing was uncomplicated and easy, free from complex feelings of inferiority, superiority, jealousy, or envy, largely due to the consistently positive atmosphere at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

He attended Campion School, which he remembers as a tough and strict environment, not very fun until classes nine and ten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. The school was simple and cosmopolitan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>, with common experiences like getting an ice cream during recess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Birla was a good student until around eighth grade, after which his academic performance slipped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. His only major fear was exams, particularly the hyped and scary ICSE exams in 10th standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Despite his family's prominence, he received no special attention at school and was treated as just one student among 40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. Media at the time (1970s and early 1980s), primarily Doordarshan and radio, was not intrusive or sensational, focusing on day-to-day or world news rather than business families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

### Family Dynamics and Relationships
Birla’s strong family ties significantly shaped him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. He was always closer to his mother but also had a strong bond with his father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. Living with his great-grandfather, grandfather, and father, all of whom were working, provided a high-energy environment with much to learn from their conversations at the dining table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. This period instilled a lot of self-assuredness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. His family encouraged exploration, emphasized duty, and valued discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. The years spent at home were more influential than his school years in shaping him into the adult he became <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.

#### Multi-Generational Influences
The men in his family were products of different eras, each with distinct influences:
*   **Great-Grandfather:** A product of pre-independent India, he embraced the socioeconomic concept of trusteeship—that private companies should contribute to collective prosperity rather than merely serving as emblems of capitalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:08">[00:55:08]</a>. This concept, derived from his close association with Mahatma Gandhi, emphasized giving back to society as a given responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:40">[00:55:40]</a>. Birla's great-grandfather played a significant role in building Indian industry at a grassroots level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. He encouraged Birla to be his own person and make his own decisions from a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>.
*   **Grandfather:** Represented a time of scarcity in India, influenced by socialism and India's nascent stage as a developing country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. He was more conservative and numbers-driven in his business approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. He lived a very simple life, continuing frugal habits even after India's liberalization, a trait that exposed Birla to living within means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. He was a doting figure, showering immense love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>.
*   **Father:** Grew up in liberalized India and was more expansive and a risk-taker in his business views, aggressively expanding internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. He was a tough taskmaster, demanding constant vigilance and pushing Birla hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>. However, he also gave Birla a lot of space and understood his strengths and weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>. His father set the agenda for his professional life, insisting he become a CA and MBA to join the family business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:31">[01:03:31]</a>. This strictness, though painful, was seen by Birla as a necessary push from his "dreamer" self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>.

Birla found his great-grandfather to be his "best friend" during [[Childhood and family influences | childhood]], spending Sundays going to movies or the aquarium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. He had a great rapport with all three, each equation being very different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>. The collective [[The role of personal relationships and family dynamics in shaping ones life | family dynamics]], where different personalities balanced each other (some being "good cop," others "bad cop"), provided a broad emotional base and worked well as a team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:18">[00:30:18]</a>.

### Impact of Father's Passing
Birla's father passed away at 52, when Birla was 28 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>. His father had been suffering from cancer for two years, and the first feeling Birla experienced upon his death was relief from his father's pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>. This was followed by a sense of emptiness and a significant feeling of responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>. Work became his biggest escape, allowing him to give back by carrying forward his father's name and legacy, completing projects his father couldn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>. This intense focus on work blunted the sense of emptiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>.

Looking back, Birla wouldn't change anything about his father, understanding the pressures of building a career that limited family time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>. He acknowledges his father's rough edges but considers him a good man and father who protected and pushed him when needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>. Birla sees himself as very different from his father, attributing this to differing circumstances and people in his life, and the constant encouragement to be his own person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>.

### Legacy and Values
The Birla family views legacy as impact rather than accolades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:24">[00:50:24]</a>. It's about the impact on people and society, primarily through business, and how one connects with people and gives back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>. Giving back is seen as a responsibility, not generosity or philanthropy, because businesses take from society and generate profit, making it a "given" to return a portion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:20">[00:51:20]</a>. This perspective is rooted in the "trusteeship" concept, which has permeated generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:08">[00:55:08]</a>. The family does not publicly document their charitable work, viewing it as a "gupt daan" (secret giving) that is part of the normal course of business and life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:46">[00:54:46]</a>. This is why there's no comprehensive documentation of their philanthropic efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:29">[00:53:29]</a>.

Birla feels strongly about addressing societal inequalities, such as gender inequality in marriage expectations and educational opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:10">[00:47:10]</a>. He advocates for changing mindsets, especially regarding dowry and the preference for educating sons over daughters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:15">[00:48:15]</a>. He highlights an example from a scholarship run in his father's name, where a girl from a conservative family could only pursue higher education because of the scholarship, as her parents chose to educate her brother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:31">[00:49:31]</a>. This deep-rooted inequality bothers him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>.

The [[family_history_with_mahatma_gandhi | family's history with Mahatma Gandhi]] and the gandhian way of living, characterized by simplicity and minimal emphasis on rituals, still influence them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:46">[00:56:46]</a>. This influence includes an element of liberalism, as Gandhi himself was not overly concerned with societal norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:47">[00:58:47]</a>. Birla's family elders shared stories of burning imported clothes and wearing Khadi during the Freedom Movement, illustrating the passion for self-sufficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:37">[00:57:37]</a>.

### Work Ethic and Personal Growth
Birla believes there is no substitute for smart hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40">[01:21:40]</a>. This work ethic was picked up from his family, observing three generations intensely involved in their work daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:13">[01:21:13]</a>. He has consciously stayed away from media, preferring to be a private person who expresses opinions in appropriate forums rather than publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:54">[00:44:54]</a>. He finds it liberating not to be overly concerned with what others say about him, a trait he developed despite being advised to be careful with his strong opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:24">[00:43:24]</a>. This inner conviction has worked to his advantage, as it removes the pressure of external perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:15">[00:44:15]</a>.

He attributes his ability to remain calm to maturity and learning from life, viewing anger in a corporate context as a loss of control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:45">[01:07:45]</a>. He is much less likely to lose his cool now than 10 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:51">[01:07:51]</a>.

Overall, [[The role of personal relationships and family dynamics in shaping ones life | Kumar Birla]] reflects on his [[Influence of upbringing on achievements | upbringing]] as having significantly shaped his [[Childhood and family influences | character]] and professional path, fostering a strong work ethic, a sense of responsibility, and a thoughtful approach to life and business.

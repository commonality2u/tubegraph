Navia, a prominent figure in the development sector, discusses her journey and vision for nonprofit work and [[entrepreneurship and youth mentorship | social entrepreneurship]] in India.

## Background and Inspiration
Navia grew up in Delhi and did not experience the "Bollywood environment" often assumed of her background [00:29:29]. She studied in a boarding school in the UK for five years from the age of 12, then pursued college in the US for another five years [00:25:33]. She returned to India during the COVID-19 lockdown in May 2020 and finished her senior year online [00:25:38].

Her decision to start a nonprofit stems from a fundamental belief that she would be doing this work regardless of her privileged background [00:31:31]. She identifies herself as a [[motivational_pluralism_and_philanthropy | social entrepreneur]], focused on building businesses that chase purpose rather than profit [00:27:50]. This positions her as a "middleman" between purely purpose-centric and profit-centric approaches [00:27:57].

## Project Navia: A Focus on Women
Navia launched her nonprofit, Project Navia, in May 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic [00:25:56]. The organization primarily operates in the areas of [[educational_initiatives_by_ngos | education]], healthcare, legal awareness, and [[entrepreneurship among young adults | entrepreneurship]] for women [00:26:06].

### Initial Healthcare Initiatives
The nonprofit began with healthcare initiatives during the lockdown, specifically running sanitary pad drives for women in Mumbai's *chawls* who lacked access to menstrual hygiene products [00:26:15]. This was due to their inability to leave their homes during the lockdown [00:26:27].

### Entrepreneurship Pillar
Project Navia's [[entrepreneurship and youth mentorship | entrepreneurship]] community comprises about 25,000 women, predominantly housewives and mothers who started small-scale businesses [00:26:40]. Navia believes that encouraging [[entrepreneurship_among_young_adults | entrepreneurship]] requires more than just capital or investment [00:29:06]. It necessitates creating a supportive ecosystem [00:29:15]. The community provides resources by partnering with various entities like ad agencies and legal firms, offering access to essential services that small-scale entrepreneurs often struggle to find [00:29:19].

## Vision for Social Entrepreneurship in India
Navia aims to establish Project Navia as an internationally recognized example of [[motivational_pluralism_and_philanthropy | social entrepreneurship]] from India [00:30:01]. She believes India is uniquely positioned for this, given its blend of people who value both profit and purpose [00:30:08]. Her long-term goal, beyond a five-year span, is to bring these two aspects together and showcase India's model to the world [00:30:08].

Personally, Navia values building something of her own to establish her identity, independent of her family's legacy [00:30:36]. This ambition is not solely driven by profit but by a desire for respect, purpose, and self-made achievement [00:30:58].

## Challenges and Perspectives
Navia acknowledges her significant advantages due to her privileged background, making her path comparatively easier than many young girls in India [00:31:31]. She, therefore, feels she is not in a position to complain about any associated pressures [00:31:45].

She views herself as an awkward person who takes time to get comfortable around others, often feeling the pressure of preconceived notions people have about her [00:32:03]. She is also not creative, but proud of her traditional and cultural upbringing, which influenced her desire to return to and work in India after spending a decade abroad [00:33:46].

### Societal Issues and Youth Involvement
Navia believes that her generation has inherited a world fraught with social, economic, and political issues [02:19:46]. She highlights a sense of entitlement among Gen Z, which she attributes to not being given enough opportunities or seats at the table to voice their opinions and contribute to building the future [02:19:56]. She argues that if young people, who constitute 60% of India's population, were given more chances, the conversation about their capabilities would be much larger [02:20:11]. She sees Gen Z not as "woke" but as actively trying to rectify past issues and build a future for themselves [02:20:59].

### Addressing Income Inequality
Regarding income inequality, Navia supports policies like property taxes and inheritance taxes, suggesting that funds from these sources could be used to improve the quality of free [[educational_initiatives_by_ngos | education]] and foster [[entrepreneurship_and_youth_mentorship | entrepreneurship]] [01:34:08]. She emphasizes creating more opportunities for young people, especially those from tier two and tier three cities, to pursue [[entrepreneurship_among_young_adults | entrepreneurship]] [01:34:44].

### Nurturing Entrepreneurship
Navia advocates for changing the narrative around [[entrepreneurship and youth mentorship | entrepreneurship]], moving beyond the conventional stereotype of startup founders [01:36:32]. She suggests selling the idea that entrepreneurs can be anyone, including young adults or housewives [01:36:40]. The goal is to optimize wealth creation through [[entrepreneurship_and_startup_success | entrepreneurship]] and encourage people to pursue it without fear of financial risk [01:35:10].

She believes that selling the narrative of diverse entrepreneurs would empower more people to explore this path [01:36:40]. For her, a primary way to address income inequality is to cultivate more [[entrepreneurship_and_startup_success | entrepreneurship]] [01:33:04]. This can be achieved by providing solutions that make [[entrepreneurship_among_young_adults | entrepreneurship]] an aspirational career, rather than just a financial risk [01:34:32].

### Educational Reform
Navia strongly advocates for reforms in the [[educational_initiatives_by_ngos | education]] system, particularly by moving away from traditional, marks-oriented approaches [01:39:11]. She supports models like the Montessori system, which respects individual learning capacities and focuses on life skills, first aid, and basic banking, rather than solely on competition [01:47:42]. She views the current system as "polluting society" by instilling conformity and fierce competition from a young age [01:46:58].

She stresses the [[importance_of_community_support_for_ngos | importance of community support for NGOs]] and initiatives that provide practical skills for the workplace and interpersonal relationships [01:48:05]. The high rates of depression and mental health issues among children are linked to the current rigid educational methods [01:48:50]. Navia believes that focusing on skills and a more adaptable learning environment from an early age, rather than just exams, is crucial for fostering happier, well-adjusted individuals [01:49:01].

Navia highlights that true knowledge comes from within and cannot be forced through traditional schooling [01:43:08]. She supports creating an environment where children can freely choose their interests and learn relevant skills, rather than being confined by inherited beliefs or conventional career paths [01:44:19].

## Personal Reflection
Navia's personal brand is defined by honesty and vulnerability [02:32:44]. She does not conform to external perceptions or her family name, choosing instead to be true to herself [02:32:58]. She believes that authenticity in public life garners genuine respect and works better than being fake [02:27:51].

Navia is open to criticism, particularly in her field, recognizing that people's lived experiences differ from her privileged background [02:28:49]. She is grateful for public acknowledgment of her work and views criticism as an opportunity for improvement [02:29:48].

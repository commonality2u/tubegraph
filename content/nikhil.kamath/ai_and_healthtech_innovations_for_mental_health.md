## Energize: The World's First Mental Health Wearable

Energize is a company that has developed what they claim to be the world's first mental health wearable, designed to address chronic stress and its symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:06">[00:48:06]</a>. The core problem it aims to solve is the modern individual's sympathetic nervous system being constantly active due to numerous stressors, which downregulates the parasympathetic system, making it harder to return to a state of calm or homeostasis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>.

### The Problem with Existing Wearables

Current wearables primarily diagnose stress by tracking heart rate and sleep data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:46">[00:49:46]</a>. However, they lack actionable insights, telling users they are stressed without providing a solution or a way to alleviate it on demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:32">[00:49:32]</a>. This often leads to users discontinuing their use of such devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>.

### The Energize Solution

Energize's solution is a solution-based wearable that utilizes Vagus nerve stimulating technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:16">[00:49:16]</a>. The device attaches behind the ear and sends low-voltage electrical currents to the nervous system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:19">[00:49:19]</a>, effectively de-stressing the user within 10 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a>. This technology, while about 30 years old, was traditionally invasive, used for conditions like refractive seizures or depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:33">[00:50:33]</a>. Through advancements in engineering, the technology has become non-invasive and miniaturized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>. Energize claims to have created the world's smallest and most portable Vagus nerve stimulator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:58">[00:50:58]</a>.

The device works by stimulating various parts of the limbic system, which controls emotion, retaliation, and resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:19">[00:54:19]</a>. This process fosters neuroplasticity, rewiring the brain to create new neural networks that increase resilience to stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:59">[00:53:59]</a>. This makes the product the "opposite of dependency," as continued use reduces the impact of stressors of the same magnitude over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:52">[00:54:52]</a>.

### Safety, Market, and Business Model

*   **Safety and Approvals**: The technology is considered super safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:32">[00:50:32]</a>. Energize has conducted three clinical studies and one clinical trial approved by CDSO (India's central drug authority) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:05">[00:51:05]</a>. They are currently filing for FDA licensing to sell in the U.S. as a medical device by early next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:09">[00:51:09]</a>. While currently for individuals 18 and over, future tests might expand its use to younger demographics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:07">[00:56:07]</a>. The device is naturally limiting, with a safe usage of up to 60 minutes per day, though discomfort typically leads users to remove it after 10-20 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:20">[00:56:20]</a>.
*   **Funding and Revenue**: Energize has raised approximately 6.5 crores (around $780,000 USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:11">[00:51:11]</a> and is seeking to raise an additional $3 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a>. They have received orders totaling around 1.5 crores (approximately $180,000 USD) and began shipping products in April <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:47">[00:51:47]</a>.
*   **Pricing and Recurring Model**: The module costs 5,000 rupees (about $60 USD) for a one-time purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:21">[00:53:21]</a>. It uses patches that need to be replaced every 14 sessions, costing 500 rupees (about $6 USD) for a two-month supply, translating to an added cost of 250 rupees per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:15">[00:53:15]</a>. This creates a recurring revenue model.
*   **Vision**: The company aims to establish a new category of solution-based wearables that offer a predictable outcome for mental health, akin to taking paracetamol for a fever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:59">[00:55:59]</a>. They focus on the broad population experiencing daily stress, rather than solely clinical depression or anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:55">[00:56:55]</a>.
*   **Broader Impact**: The technology has potential applications beyond general stress, including aiding children with ADHD and in stroke rehabilitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:38">[00:56:38]</a>. The founders believe the wearable could become a "new normal" in managing well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:25">[00:51:25]</a>. This contributes to the broader discussion on the [[future_directions_of_ai | future directions of AI]] and the [[applications_and_future_of_ai | applications and future of AI]].

The speaker draws a parallel between [[perspectives_on_entrepreneurship | Politics]] and [[entrepreneurship_and_leadership_insights | Entrepreneurship]], noting many similarities that are often overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. The podcast itself often focuses on [[perspectives_on_entrepreneurship | entrepreneurship]] and aims to guide new entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

## Early Life and Influences

The speaker was born in Vadnagar, a small town in North Gujarat, which had a population of about 15,000 during his childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. His village, part of the Gaekwad Strait, had a strong emphasis on education, with facilities like a pond for swimming, a post office, and a library <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. He learned swimming in the village pond and attended a primary school built by the Gaekwad State <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>. His schooling continued at Narayanacharya High School, also known as BN High, which was charitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.

He recounts an anecdote about the Chinese philosopher Yuan, who reportedly lived in his village, and how this historical connection was brought to his attention by the Chinese President after he became Prime Minister in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>.

Regarding his childhood academic performance, the speaker describes himself as a "very average student" who wasn't particularly noticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>. He preferred other activities over competitive exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>. He left home at a very young age, losing touch with most childhood friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:00">[10:52:00]</a>. As Chief Minister, he wished to reconnect with his old friends to show them he hadn't changed, inviting about 30-35 of them to the CM House <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:00">[11:22:22]</a>. He also made a public effort to honor all his childhood teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:27:00">[13:27:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] [[influence_of_personal_upbringing_on_professional_success | Influence of personal upbringing on professional success]]
> The speaker's humble background, where becoming a primary school teacher would have been a cause for celebration, meant he never had grand dreams for himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. His life path, he states, was shaped by circumstances rather than personal creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. Observing mothers carrying water for kilometers in his childhood fostered a deep desire to provide basic necessities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.

## Defining Leadership in Politics

For a politician, two things are distinct: becoming a politician and being successful in politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.
A successful politician requires:
*   Dedication and commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>
*   Being a partner in people's happiness and sorrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>
*   Being a good team player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>
*   A "mission" that stands above personal ambition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>

> [!QUOTE] Mission over Ambition
> "Good people should continue to come into politics... And he came with a mission and an ambition... No, if you have set out with a mission then go somewhere, you will find a place somewhere... will should be above ambition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.

The speaker highlights Mahatma Gandhi as a leader whose life spoke louder than any physical attributes or flowery speeches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. Gandhi's power lay in his communication, advocating non-violence while holding a stick, and inspiring the world to wear the "Gandhi cap" despite never wearing one himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

## Navigating Challenges and Criticism

The speaker notes that modern politicians are often seen as professional categories delivering flowery speeches, which may garner applause for a few days but ultimately, it is "life's work" that matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

### Public Perception and Personal Growth
The speaker discusses accusations and abuse in politics, advising that if one is truthful and has done nothing wrong, they will face no problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. He shares a humorous anecdote about an Ahmedabadi man who doesn't take insults, implying that criticism doesn't affect him if he isn't "taking" it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] On Sensitivity in Politics
> The speaker states that politicians do not need to have "thick skin" but "must be very sensitive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. Without sensitivity, one cannot do good for people in public life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.

Social media is seen as a huge power that strengthens democracy by allowing people to verify information and get closer to the truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>. He highlights the impact of social media in spreading awareness, citing how children know about Gaganyaan's timetable and astronaut training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.

### Overcoming Anxiety and Personal Loss
The speaker acknowledges the presence of anxiety in life, even for himself, but emphasizes that he has learned to manage his emotions and stay focused on his mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. He recalls remaining calm during election results and immediately going to the police control room during the 2002 Gujarat bomb blasts, despite security concerns, because of his sense of responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Chandrayaan-2 Setback
> The speaker recounts the Chandrayaan-2 launch failure in 2019, where he chose to be present despite the risk of failure, taking personal responsibility for the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>. After the failure, he personally met with the scientists early in the morning to instill confidence, emphasizing that "the responsibility is mine, you tried, do not be disappointed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>. This incident provided a significant [[personal_reflections_and_life_choices | learning experience]] for his approach to leadership.

He shares an early life setback from childhood, when his father couldn't afford to send him to a Sainik school he wanted to attend, leaving a lasting desire to help others achieve their dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. His desire to lead a saintly life and join the Ramakrishna Mission also went unfulfilled due to not meeting qualifications, but he was not disappointed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. These "setbacks" have significantly shaped his personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.

Regarding the loss of a parent, he notes his life was different as he left home young, so the attachment was not the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. However, he cherishes the wisdom his uneducated mother shared at 100 years old: "Work smart, live a life of purity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.

## Core Beliefs and Guiding Principles

The speaker lives by the motto: "Nation First" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>. He is ready to let go of old ways and accept new ones if they serve this criterion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. He believes idealism is more important than ideology in politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.

<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>
> [!QUOTE] Nation First
> "If I have a tag line then Nation First, then whoever fits in it, I am once again in the shackles of that Idiot G. It does not bind... If it is necessary to go traditional, I do it so I have to let go of old things, I'm ready to give up new things, ready to accept but criteria, what nation, First, my scale is one, the scale doesnâ€™t change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.

He lives outside his comfort zone, feeling "unfit" for comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. This approach allows him to derive satisfaction from small achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>. He attributes his high "risk-taking capacity" to not caring about himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>, stating "zero fear, not afraid of anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>.

A personal practice involves spending time alone in places with no human presence to introspect, which he calls "meeting myself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:09:00">[11:09:00]</a>. He recalls a profound experience in the desert near the Pakistan border that later inspired him to develop the area as a tourist destination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>.

## Advice for Aspiring Leaders

*   **Enter politics with a mission, not just for power:** Politics is not just about contesting elections, winning, or gaining power; it's about connecting with social life and serving the common people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.
*   **Embrace public service:** Politics should be given respect, and good people should enter it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>. Voters themselves are also politicians who apply their minds when casting votes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13:00]</a>.
*   **Be sensitive, not thick-skinned:** A true leader needs sensitivity to understand and address the suffering of the people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.
*   **Leverage technology for governance:** Initiatives like India Stack (Direct Benefit Transfer, UPI, e-KYC) have democratized technology, brought transparency, and eliminated corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on process simplification:** "Minimum Government, Maximum Governance" means simplifying processes and removing unnecessary compliance burdens, rather than reducing the number of ministers or employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>.
*   **Don't fear failure, learn from it:** Failure provides valuable experience and helps in navigating life's challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.
*   **Develop leadership qualities:** The speaker encourages young women to come forward for [[importance_of_leadership_and_adaptability_in_politics | leadership]] roles, especially with increasing reservations in local governance bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. He urges youth to enter politics in any form and contribute creatively to the nation's needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.
*   **Credibility and consistency:** India's credibility in the world comes from its consistent stance on peace and direct communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.

## Evolution of Leadership Across Terms

The speaker reflects on the differences between his terms as Prime Minister:
*   **First Term:** Learning to understand Delhi and how it works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:31">[01:57:31]</a>.
*   **Second Term:** Expanding his thinking, courage, and dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. His desire for a "Developed India 2047" drives his approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:15">[01:58:15]</a>.
*   **Current Focus:** Ensuring 100% delivery of benefits to 100% of beneficiaries, promoting social justice, and true secularism without discrimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:04">[01:59:04]</a>. His thoughts are now centered around the 2047 vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:46">[01:59:46]</a>. He also emphasizes preparing the next generation of leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:10">[02:00:10]</a>.

<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:18">[01:31:18]</a>
> [!NOTE] Aspiration as a Driving Force
> The speaker observes a significant shift in aspirations among India's youth, who are now more inclined to "build in India" rather than pursuing opportunities abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:40">[01:38:40]</a>. This "aspirational India" is a key driving force for his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:18">[01:59:18]</a>.

His travel to Kuwait and interaction with Indian laborers, who now aspire for international airports in their home districts, further reinforces his belief in the country's growing aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. He envisions India as a leader capable of bringing about significant change through effective policy-making and execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>.

The WTF Fund, a non-dilutive grant for founders aged 25 and under, supports various innovative startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Among these, several are pioneering advancements in pet care and [[diet_and_nutrition | nutrition]].

## Genetic Testing for Enhanced Pet Health
One notable advancement in pet care is the introduction of India's first dog DNA test by Urban Animal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. This initiative aims to help pet parents identify diseases at a much earlier stage, enabling proactive care and improving the quality of dogs' lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. The long-term vision is to increase the lifespan of dogs by up to three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This demonstrates how [[revolutionizing_healthcare_and_personal_devices_with_ai_and_wearable_technology | technological advancements]] are impacting animal health, aligning with efforts to improve [[role_of_supplements_in_longevity | longevity]] across species.

## Innovative Pet Nutrition
Another area of advancement is in pet [[diet_and_nutrition | nutrition]]. A company supported by the WTF Fund is focusing on creating protein and food on a larger scale for pets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Their plan includes producing food in regions where it was not previously possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. A key innovation is their method of converting unused carbon, in a carbohydrate form, into protein more efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This approach highlights [[innovative_health_business_opportunities | new business models]] and [[unique_food_ingredients | novel food production]] methods that could significantly impact the [[role_of_diet_and_nutrition_in_health | role of diet and nutrition]] in animal health.

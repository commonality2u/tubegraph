The WTA team undertook a personal delivery initiative to distribute packages to winners of a recent [[contest_for_creators_in_bangalore | contest for creators]] in Bangalore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This effort involved traveling across the city to hand-deliver kits to select individuals who were available after weeks of coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## The Delivery Process

The team coordinated with winners via phone calls to ensure they were at home before arrival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. The deliveries were a team effort, with one person filming and another engaging with the winners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The team navigated Bangalore, noting observations about the city, such as its unique weather, which residents find exciting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## Meeting the Winners

The personal deliveries offered a chance to interact with the contest winners, learn about their journeys, and witness their reactions to receiving the creator kits.

### Ashutosh

Ashutosh, one of the winners, had recently left an IT job to pursue an internship as a social media manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. He explained that he enjoys watching other creators and found happiness in making content, leading him to pursue it seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Ashutosh, who was 22 years old at the time of the delivery, aims to create comedy or entertainment-focused content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. The team expressed their hope to see more videos from him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

### Second Winner

Another recipient expressed that receiving the kit validated their efforts and encouraged them to continue their content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. They shared a long-term dream of traveling to every state in India to document its culture and festivals through stories and research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

### Anjal

Anjal began making videos during the lockdown period, initially not taking it seriously for a few months before deciding to post consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. Anjal is currently studying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Their content started with art and has since expanded to lifestyle, travel, and fashion videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

### Fourth Winner

The final delivery was made to a product manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

## Team Reflections

The team successfully delivered four packages, describing the experience as "wholesome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. They met individuals and their families who were described as "cute and sweet," some even offering them food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. Despite the positive interactions, the day's events left the host's "social battery" at zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

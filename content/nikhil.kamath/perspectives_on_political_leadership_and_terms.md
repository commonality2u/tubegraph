## Qualities of Political Leaders

For youth aspiring to become politicians, certain [[qualities needed for youth to join politics | talents]] are essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. It is crucial that "good people should keep coming in politics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. These individuals should enter politics with a "mission not with ambition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

A leader's [[personal_reflections_on_leadership | self-perception]] and humility are also significant. A Chief Minister noted in a speech, "I too must be making mistakes, I am also a human being, I am not some god" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Leaders also express concern about global events, such as the world moving towards war, and emphasize a stance in favor of peace rather than neutrality during crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Navigating Leadership Terms

The experience of a leader can differ significantly between terms. When asked about the difference between a PM's first and second terms, it was noted that in the first term, "people used to try to understand me as well and I was also trying to understand Delhi" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. This implies an initial period of mutual understanding and adaptation.

## Public Perceptions of Politics

There is a deeply ingrained public perception of politics. Growing up in a South Indian middle-class family, it was a common belief "since childhood that politics is a dirty place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. This view has become "so ingrained in our psyche that it is very difficult to change it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

[[Definition of metaverse | The metaverse]] is often defined as something three-dimensional, incorporating [[Technology and virtual reality | virtual reality]] (VR) and [[Technology and virtual reality | augmented reality]] (AR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:03">[03:44:03]</a>. While current digital experiences on smartphones are largely two-dimensional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>, the general understanding is that the more immersive an experience becomes, the more it aligns with the concept of "meta" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.

## Current State of [[Devices and technology in the metaverse | VR/AR Devices]]

Devices like the Oculus are examples of current [[Technology and virtual reality | VR technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. Users have reported "pretty amazing" moments when using Oculus, experiencing a sense of truly being in a different environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. Some have tried fitness and music applications within these [[Technology and virtual reality | virtual reality]] environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:03">[03:44:03]</a>.

However, existing VR devices like the Oculus are noted for being bulky and expensive, costing around $400-$500 for the new version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. This makes them accessible for only "very few Elite experiences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.

> [!INFO] Definition of "Metaversal"
> The term "metaversal habit" is used to describe the current behavior of disappearing into digital universes based on personal taste, such as opening Instagram for lifestyle content or logging into Twitter for thoughts and opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. These existing digital spaces are considered "universes" that users log into <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.

## [[Challenges and Opportunities in the VR and AR Space | Characteristics of Immersive Experiences]]

The core concept of [[Technology and virtual reality | VR and AR]] involves a transformation where one's physical location is virtually altered via a device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. This transformation into another location is often seen as a key aspect of what truly qualifies an experience as part of the [[Metaverse | metaverse]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

While current smartphone usage, where people are immersed in their screens, can be considered a "metaversal experience" due to the behavior of logging off reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>, a more complete [[Definition of metaverse | definition of the metaverse]] typically requires a three-dimensional experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

## Future Outlook

Looking ahead, there is a vision for a world where current [[Current digital universes on smartphones | phone]] browsers or apps could provide a "three-dimensional feel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. This suggests a future where immersive 3D experiences might become more integrated into everyday [[Devices and technology in the metaverse | technology]] beyond dedicated [[Technology and virtual reality | VR headsets]].

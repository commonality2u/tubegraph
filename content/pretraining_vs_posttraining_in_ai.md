## Pre-training vs Post-training in AI

In the realm of artificial intelligence, especially within the development of language models like those created by OpenAI, there exists a significant distinction between pre-training and post-training. In a podcast discussion, John Schulman, a co-founder of OpenAI, shared his insights into these crucial stages of AI model development.

### Understanding Pre-training

Pre-training is the initial phase where the AI model is exposed to a vast corpus of data from the internet. This includes web pages, code, and various forms of documentation. The goal during this phase is to train the model to imitate the content it encounters, essentially learning to generate outputs that resemble content seen on the web. 

A vital component of pre-training is the model's task to predict the next token given a sequence of previous tokens. Tokens can be entire words or parts of words, depending on the model's configuration. The model is trained to maximize the likelihood of these predictions, which involves assigning probabilities to various potential outputs. This rigorous process ensures that the output appears coherent and contextually appropriate, simulating natural human language use [[limitations_of_large_language_models_in_solving_novel_tasks | despite limitations in solving novel tasks]].

### Post-training Process

Post-training, on the other hand, is a refinement stage where the modelâ€™s capabilities are narrowed down to perform more specific tasks. For example, Schulman mentions targeting the model to behave like a chat assistant rather than just imitating web content. The emphasis shifts from broader imitation to generating outputs that are more helpful and user-friendly. 

During post-training, the objective changes from raw content replication to optimizing human approval. In other words, the model is honed to produce responses that humans would find useful, accurate, and pleasing. This process often involves [[role_and_impact_of_reinforcement_learning_with_human_feedback_rlhf | fine-tuning with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)]] which aligns the model's outputs more closely with human expectations and societal norms.

Pre-training establishes the model's foundational capabilities, whereas post-training allows for the personalization and enhancement of these capabilities, making models practical and effective in real-world applications [[ai_scaling_and_its_effectiveness | as AI scaling proves its effectiveness]].

### Implications and Future Directions

John Schulman underscored the importance of both training phases. While pre-training provides the broad base knowledge for the model, post-training is where a model truly becomes useful and safe for deployment. The [[development_and_challenges_in_ai_scaling_and_optimization | post-training phase is expected to evolve, increasing in importance relative to pre-training]], as models become more capable and their applications become more complex.

In the future, the development focus may shift towards more [[future_capabilities_and_progress_of_ai_models | sophisticated post-training techniques]] that could involve newer modalities and complex interaction scenarios, helping AI models perform more versatile and complex tasks more seamlessly.

Pre-training and post-training collectively illustrate the differentiated but complementary roles these phases play in building sophisticated AI systems. Understanding this dichotomy enhances our comprehension of the progression from general content assimilation to task-specific proficiency in AI models [[aligning with AI safety and existential risk considerations]], facilitating more informed discussions on the potential [[impact_of_ai_on_future_economic_growth | impact of AI on future economic growth]] and societal progress.

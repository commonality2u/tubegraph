[[Australias tactical decisions and execution in the World Cup | Australia]] faced significant challenges in their 2023 Cricket World Cup match against [[Afghanistans strategic play and bowling tactics in their match against Australia | Afghanistan]], particularly in their batting performance and ability to adapt to difficult conditions. The game became renowned for a remarkable individual effort that overshadowed the team's struggles.

## Early Struggles
[[Afghanistans strategic play and bowling tactics in their match against Australia | Afghanistan]] set a challenging total, reaching nearly 300 runs after a steady batting performance where [[Australias tactical decisions and execution in the World Cup | Australia]] failed to take as many wickets as they should have initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. While [[Afghanistans strategic play and bowling tactics in their match against Australia | Afghanistan]] intended to use their spin bowlers to take wickets, it was their quicks who started effectively, followed by the spinners, leading to [[Australias performance and challenges in the World Cup 2023 match against Afghanistan | Australia]] being reduced to 91 for 7 wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Glenn Maxwell's Historic Innings
The team's precarious position left only captain Pat Cummins and an injured Glenn Maxwell at the crease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Maxwell, suffering from severe cramps and unable to run, faced an uphill battle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Despite his physical limitations, appearing "reduced to little more than a knelled elf that had been tossed in a fire," he continued to hit boundaries in "weird and wild ways" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. He could not physically run between wickets, often resembling "Charlie Chaplin on 12 frames" when attempting to move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. His batting relied almost entirely on "hands" rather than body movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

Maxwell's innings was marred by multiple dropped catches and a controversial DRS decision that went his way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, but he ultimately won the game "almost entirely on his own" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. This performance set several records:
*   Most runs ever made by a team after losing seven wickets (179 runs from Maxwell's bat in partnership with Pat Cummins) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   Highest score by a number six in ODI Cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.
*   Highest score by an Australian in an ODI and at a World Cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>.
*   First double-hundred by an Australian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.
*   First double-hundred when not opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.
*   First double-hundred when chasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>.

Before this innings, Maxwell was already an outlier in World Cup cricket with an exceptional strike rate, and this performance only further cemented his unique standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. The speaker considers it one of the greatest innings in World Cup history, possibly even greater than those by Viv Richards, Kapil Dev, or Kevin O'Brien, given the physical and scoreboard challenges Maxwell faced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.

### Pat Cummins' Supporting Role
Pat Cummins, while contributing only 12 runs to the 179-run partnership, played a crucial role in staying at the other end, batting longer than he ever had in an ODI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. His disciplined approach allowed Maxwell to continue his onslaught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>.

## Other Batting Challenges
### Marcus Stoinis's Dismissal
Marcus Stoinis's dismissal was noteworthy due to his choice of shot. He played a reverse sweep, a shot he rarely uses in professional cricket (2.2% of the time in ODIs and even less in T20s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:45">[00:27:45]</a>. This choice highlighted [[Australias cricket strategy and performance in ODI World Cup 2023 | Australia's]] perceived weakness against spin bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a>.

### Mitchell Starc's Non-Review
Mitchell Starc's dismissal was another curious moment. He was out caught behind but chose not to review, despite the ball appearing not to have edged his bat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. Replays suggested the ball might have flicked the stump instead, leading to a slight movement, illustrating that batters "do not always know when they hit it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>.

## Batting Against Spin
Despite earlier concerns, and initial struggles in the tournament, [[Australias cricket strategy and performance in ODI World Cup 2023 | Australia]] had, on average, performed better against spin in this World Cup compared to previous cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>. However, questions remained about whether this improvement was due to specific players like Marnus Labuschagne or Maxwell's exceptional form, or a genuine overall team improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>. The inclusion of Josh Inglis as wicketkeeper, replacing Alex Carey, had not yielded much success as Inglis had barely faced any balls in the tournament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:22">[00:32:22]</a>.

## Overall Outcome
While Glenn Maxwell's innings secured an improbable victory, the match highlighted [[Australias performance and challenges in the World Cup 2023 match against Afghanistan | Australia's]] vulnerabilities, particularly their top-order collapse and occasional tactical missteps against spin bowling. The speaker noted that [[Australias performance and challenges in the World Cup 2023 match against Afghanistan | Australia]] "did not win this cricket game, [[Australias performance and challenges in the World Cup 2023 match against Afghanistan | Australia]] did not deserve to win this cricket game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, emphasizing Maxwell's singular effort in overcoming the significant challenges.

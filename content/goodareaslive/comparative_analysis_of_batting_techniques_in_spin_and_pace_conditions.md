Cricket has seen a significant evolution in batting approaches, particularly concerning how batters face different bowling conditions. Modern players like [[Yashasvi Jaiswal | Yashasvi Jaiswal]] demonstrate a hybrid style that combines traditional technique with aggressive, white-ball influenced tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. This contrasts with earlier eras and even contemporary peers.

## Batting Against Spin

Traditionally, Indian batters have employed a specific style against spin bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>:
*   **Navjot Sidhu's Approach** – Navjot Sidhu exemplified a technique against spinners that involved periods of resolute defense, often using the full face of the bat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. He would defend for long stretches, seemingly lulling the bowler, before suddenly charging down the wicket to hit a six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. This "run down and hit a six" strategy was typical for Indian batters, only employed when they felt on top or the field was up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   **Outliers** – Virender Sehwag and Kapil Dev were noted as "massive outliers" to this traditional approach, suggesting a more consistently aggressive style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

## Modern Batting Styles

The game has evolved significantly, leading to different ways players approach their game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

### Yashasvi Jaiswal's Approach

[[Yashasvi Jaiswal | Jaiswal]] embodies a newer style, different from traditional Indian batters like Navjot Sidhu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>:
*   **Aggression Against Spin and Pace** – He not only runs down the wicket to hit spin for six but also takes on fast bowlers like James Anderson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
*   **Comparison to Rishabh Pant** – [[Yashasvi Jaiswal | Jaiswal]]'s attacking play is akin to Rishabh Pant's "complete belief in his game," understanding of how far he can hit, and strategic hitting of sixes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Hybrid Skillset** – His technique combines "proper Indian technical skill" with a "newer style," incorporating skills from the white-ball game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
*   **Strategic Attacking** – [[Yashasvi Jaiswal | Jaiswal]]'s game is less about "Bazball" and more about knowing when to block and when to attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. He can start slowly and then accelerate, possessing "many many gears" in his batting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

### Confronting Experienced Pace Bowlers

[[Yashasvi Jaiswal | Jaiswal]]'s willingness to attack veteran fast bowlers is a notable characteristic:
*   **Against James Anderson** – [[Yashasvi Jaiswal | Jaiswal]] specifically targeted James Anderson, hitting him for six off a short ball, attempting a heave off a wide cutter (which resulted in four via an edge), and later hitting a beautiful pull shot off a back-of-a-length delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
*   **Comparison to Kevin Pietersen** – This aggressive approach against a late-career fast bowler is compared to [[kevin_durant_brooklyn_nets | Kevin Pietersen]] attacking Glenn McGrath towards the end of his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. While McGrath's height and skill made him consistently difficult, Anderson, being shorter, sometimes allowed the ball to come onto the bat more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

## Comparative Batting Performance

When comparing early career Test averages on similar pitch conditions:
*   **[[Yashasvi Jaiswal | Jaiswal]] vs. [[Shubman Gill | Gill]]** – In their first seven Tests, both [[Yashasvi Jaiswal | Jaiswal]] and [[Shubman Gill | Gill]] played on wickets that offered some assistance to bowlers, with an average score around 31, indicating slightly bowler-friendly conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. However, [[Yashasvi Jaiswal | Jaiswal]] averaged 71 in these matches, while [[Shubman Gill | Gill]] averaged 35 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
*   **Career Trajectories** – It's important to note that early career averages do not define a player's ultimate success. Players like Jacques Kallis and Steve Waugh started poorly but achieved high batting averages, while others like Jimmy Adams had strong starts that later declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

## Adapting to Conditions

The ability to adapt batting techniques to different conditions is crucial. [[Yashasvi Jaiswal | Jaiswal]]'s dual ability to block and attack highlights a versatile approach that can be effective across varying pitch conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. In contrast, batters who cannot adjust their [[Bowling strategies and pitch analysis in test cricket | game]] from spin to pace, or vice versa, may find themselves limited.

## England's Batting in India

England's approach to batting in India has also been a point of discussion, particularly their use of "Bazball" and sweeping techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:23">[01:12:23]</a>:
*   **"Bazball" Impact** – The "Bazball" strategy has significantly changed England's batting, contributing to performances like Ollie Pope's "once in a lifetime innings" in the first Test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>. This approach has pulled England out of a period where they had a "terrible" batting lineup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a>.
*   **Sweeping Strategy** – England's batters have effectively used the sweep shot throughout the series, to the extent that the Indian camp has discussed their own batters sweeping more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:03">[00:49:03]</a>. However, in the third Test, while [[Yashasvi Jaiswal | Jaiswal]] and Sarfaraz Khan scored big on a good track, England's batters collapsed, possibly due to tiredness and scoreboard pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:05">[00:47:05]</a>.
*   **Challenges of "Bazball"** – The rapid scoring rate of "Bazball" means batters and bowlers get less rest. If the opposing team makes many runs, England's bowlers and batters have to put in long shifts, leading to exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>. The psychological pressure of a high target on a deteriorating pitch also plays a significant role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>.

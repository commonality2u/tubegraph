Kuldeep Yadav's bowling has been a significant factor in recent matches, showcasing smart strategies and adaptability to different pitch conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. His performance in the series has been notable, particularly on surfaces that complement his style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

## Strategic Bowling and Adaptability
Kuldeep Yadav's recent performance in Dharamshala highlights his effectiveness on certain types of pitches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This surface, described as similar to an Adelaide Day 3 or Gabba Day 4 pitch, features both spin and bounce, which is ideal for a wrist spinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. In contrast, many other Indian wickets are more suited for finger spinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. On this specific wicket, Kuldeep has been a constant threat to all batsmen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

A key aspect of his strategy has been bowling slightly slower, particularly in the recent match, as the pitch assisted wrist spin significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. This allowed him to maintain his optimal pace of 81 to 85 kilometers per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. He has shown growth in his confidence and the ability to think through his bowling plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

## Key Wickets and Deliveries
Kuldeep's "wrong'un" delivery has been particularly effective, playing a significant role in several dismissals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Examples include:

*   **David Warner (First Test)**: Kuldeep's delivery to Warner showed extra bounce, which is a trait wrist spinners favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   **Glenn Maxwell**: He also beat Maxwell with a wrong'un <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   **Ben Duckett**: Duckett was dismissed attempting to hit a wide ball outside off stump to the leg side, a clear error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   **Ollie Pope**: Pope tried to step out but failed to recognize the wrong'un, ending up nowhere near the pitch of the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. This was after Kuldeep received advice from Joel about Pope's tendency to step out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   **Jonny Bairstow**: Bairstow was playing well but was dismissed by a wrong'un that he failed to pick, forcing a shot he didn't need to play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   **Ben Stokes**: Stokes was caught plumb in front by a wrong'un that spun back more than anticipated, a delivery he hadn't picked earlier in the series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## Comparison and Uniqueness
Kuldeep Yadav stands out as a left-arm wrist spinner, a rare skill in men's Test cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Historically, only one left-arm wrist spinner has taken 100 Test wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a>. His approach of bowling slower and inviting batsmen to attack has proven to be a clever strategy against an aggressive England batting line-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:43">[01:06:43]</a>. He has shown versatility by adjusting his pace and delivery based on the pitch and opposition's approach, unlike some one-trick left-arm wrist spinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:56">[01:05:56]</a>. The consistent failure of England's batsmen, including wicket-keepers like Pope and Bairstow, to pick his "googly" (wrong'un) indicates that Kuldeep is operating on a different level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:42">[00:44:42]</a>.

## Impact on England's Batting
[[Indias bowling strategies and performance | India's bowling strategies]] meant that England's batsmen, particularly the middle order, struggled against Kuldeep's variations. England's top order averaged 41.55, but numbers three to seven averaged only 25 in the series, a significant gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. While the openers showed some resilience, the middle order frequently self-destructed due to aggressive shot selection and misjudgments against spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>, with [[Kuldeep Yadavs bowling performance and strategies | Kuldeep's]] "smart" bowling playing a key part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. India's patience in waiting for England's innings to collapse on its own proved effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

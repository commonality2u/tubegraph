England's [[analysis_of_joe_root_as_a_modern_part_time_bowler | Joe Root]] is often discussed as an [[role_and_impact_of_allrounders_in_test_cricket_teams | allrounder]], especially in Indian conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. However, his usage and effectiveness as a bowler have varied significantly throughout his career and even within recent series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.

## Performance Analysis

In the first innings of the Hyderabad Test, [[analysis_of_joe_root_as_a_modern_part_time_bowler | Joe Root]]'s bowling average was 15.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. This led to comments that England didn't need other spinners because they had him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. However, his average in the rest of the series plummeted to 95 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.

### Factors Affecting Performance

Several factors might explain this drop in performance:
*   **Hand Injury**: A knock on the hand was a significant problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. While he continued to bowl, suggesting the knock might not directly hurt during bowling, it could make it difficult to force the ball into his fingers, which is crucial for finger spinners to impart spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.
*   **Callus Issues**: An open callus on his finger could also make it harder and more painful to grip the ball properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.

## Evolution of Role

Historically, [[analysis_of_joe_root_as_a_modern_part_time_bowler | Joe Root]] has been used more as a [[role_and_impact_of_part_time_bowlers_in_cricket | part-timer]] than an [[role_and_impact_of_allrounders_in_test_cricket_teams | allrounder]] in terms of his bowling workload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. Although there have been periods of both increased and decreased bowling throughout his career, he has notably been working on his spin since around 2018, and his bowling has improved in the latter half of his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

In the current series, [[analysis_of_joe_root_as_a_modern_part_time_bowler | Joe Root]] has bowled more overs than in any previous series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. This increased workload stems from India not just using him when conditions are favorable or for a few maiden overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. Instead, he has been utilized more like a frontline spinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.

### Effectiveness as a Frontline Option

As a frontline spinner, [[analysis_of_joe_root_as_a_modern_part_time_bowler | Joe Root]]'s limitations become more apparent. India has started to play him much better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>. He bowls a lot of "bad balls" and struggles to land the ball consistently in the same spot, unlike a specialist frontline spinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. Compared to even a young bowler like Tom Hartley, [[analysis_of_joe_root_as_a_modern_part_time_bowler | Root]] has struggled more with his length and line at times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>.

## Impact on Batting Form

There is speculation that the increased bowling workload might be contributing to his struggles with batting form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. He appeared exhausted at times in a recent Test, both while batting and bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. Despite his [[joe_roots_batting_and_shot_selection | batting average being higher in the "Bazball" era]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>, he has struggled for form, continuing from the World Cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.

His shot selection has also been scrutinized, with his reverse scoop shot being called the "worst shot" in Test cricket history, although a previous shot against [[performance_and_role_of_ravi_ashwin_in_test_cricket | Ravi Ashwin]] in the second Test was arguably worse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. While the reverse scoop might have been a tactical attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>, his struggles may be linked to fatigue from increased bowling demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

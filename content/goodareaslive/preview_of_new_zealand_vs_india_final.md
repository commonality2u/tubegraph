The stage is set for the Champions Trophy final between New Zealand and India, with New Zealand having comprehensively defeated South Africa by 50 runs in the second semi-final in Lahore to book their spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:23">[01:00:23]</a>. The final is scheduled for Sunday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

## Match Context and Expectations

India enters the final as heavy favorites, and rightly so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:46">[00:54:46]</a>. However, New Zealand is considered India's "bogey team" in knockout games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. India could potentially play their 'B game' and still win the final <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:52">[00:56:52]</a>. The game will be played on a UAE surface, the exact nature of which is uncertain, as there were initially two wickets, then suddenly three pitches being used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. This means it might be a 'good toss to lose' for India, given Rohit Sharma's recent streak of losing 11 out of 14 tosses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

### Toss and Pitch Conditions
The toss in Dubai can sometimes play a bigger part than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. An ideal wicket for New Zealand would be one that doesn't spin much and where the ball isn't flowing off the bat easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. If the wicket is weird and slow, a target of 270-280 might be achievable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. However, if the wicket spins sideways or is really high-scoring, India is expected to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

## New Zealand's Path to the Final

New Zealand scored an above-par total of 362 against South Africa on a belter of a surface where batting conditions were easy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. The team's strategy worked perfectly, with players like Rachin Ravindra putting pressure on the opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:15">[00:49:15]</a>.

### Key Players for New Zealand

*   **Rachin Ravindra:** He scored his second century of the Champions Trophy, hitting 108 off 101 deliveries against South Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>. He also picked up the wicket of Aiden Markram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:11">[00:39:11]</a>. Ravindra set a new record as the fastest to five ODI tons in ICC 50-over events, achieving it in 13 innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:17">[00:39:17]</a>. His ability to counter both pace and spin with impeccable range makes him crucial for New Zealand's chances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. He was consistently ahead of the game, scoring at better than a run-a-ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>.

*   **Kane Williamson:** He scored 102 off 94 deliveries against South Africa, catching up after a slow start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:03">[00:42:03]</a>. Williamson is known for his skill against spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:10">[00:42:10]</a>. He showed varied intent shots, including reverse sweeps and scoops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:16">[00:43:16]</a>. He was dropped on 56 by Heinrich Klaasen, a crucial miss by South Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:36">[00:43:36]</a>. To succeed against India, he needs to avoid bad starts given his excellent strike rotation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.

*   **Daryl Mitchell & Glenn Phillips:** Mitchell scored 49 off 37, and Phillips scored an unbeaten 49 off 27 deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>. They contributed 98 runs off 64 deliveries combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:58">[00:47:58]</a>. Phillips is a "big luxury" due to his firepower, but there's a risk of over-relying on him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:04">[00:51:04]</a>. When Phillips comes in and the scoring is slow, he tends to try to go too quickly too early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:34">[00:51:34]</a>.

*   **Mitchell Santner:** Santner bowled the best spell of the game against South Africa, taking 3 for 43, including the key wickets of well-set Bavuma and Rassie van der Dussen, and also Heinrich Klaasen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. He is considered the most important player for New Zealand in that game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. His pace variations and accuracy have made him a much better bowler in the last year and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.

*   **Matt Henry:** His fitness will be crucial as he took 5 for 42 against India in the group game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:07">[00:56:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:16">[00:56:16]</a>. New Zealand needs early wickets against India, which could come from Henry or even Lockie Ferguson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:26">[00:56:26]</a>.

### Fielding
New Zealand is one of the best fielding sides, with a freakish catch success rate of 96% in the tournament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:20">[00:54:20]</a>. They will need to continue fielding brilliantly and not give India any chances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>.

## India's Position

India has not played their best cricket in this tournament, yet they are a very strong side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:55">[00:56:55]</a>. The absence of Jasprit Bumrah is a significant factor, as he is a "backup plan" for the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:36">[00:55:36]</a>.

## Potential Lineup Changes and Strategy

*   **New Zealand:** The question remains whether New Zealand will bring in Devon Conway, possibly for Will Young <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:48">[00:57:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:02">[00:58:02]</a>. There's also a discussion about potentially promoting Tom Latham to number four if the wicket spins violently, as New Zealand is sometimes too "dogmatic" with their batting lineup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:06">[00:59:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:37">[00:59:37]</a>.
*   **India:** India might consider bringing in a spare seamer ahead of Kuldeep Yadav if the surface is highly conducive to pace, though this is deemed unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:51">[00:57:51]</a>.

## Prediction

India is the better team and should win the final <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. However, New Zealand can cause issues if they take early wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:34">[00:56:34]</a>. For New Zealand to win, many things need to go well: batting first and posting 280-290, not losing wickets in the middle overs, good new ball bowling, and Santner performing exceptionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. Given these factors, India is still the favored team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

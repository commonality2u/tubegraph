The podcast "Good Areas Knockout" episode two introduced a tournament to determine the greatest **ODI** bowlers of all time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The objective was to identify the "go 64 best **ODI** Bowlers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Tournament Design
The host, Varon, explained the methodology behind selecting and seeding the **bowlers** for the knockout tournament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>:

### Comparing Pace and Spin
The trickiest part was comparing pace and spin **bowlers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The approach taken was to first identify the best spinners, resulting in a list of about 20, and then filling the rest of the spots with pace **bowlers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### Adjusted Statistics
To compare players across different eras, adjusted stats were used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This involved comparing the paces and spinners to their respective eras and then normalizing those figures to the current era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This method assumes a linearity, meaning if a bowler was 20% better in their era, they would be 20% better in the current era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. It is acknowledged that this might not always be true, as certain skills could make a bowler better or worse in a different era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

### Draw and Seeding
For this tournament, the **bowlers** were ranked to ensure a fairer seeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. The draw for the tournament was conducted only once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### Wicket Minimums
For pace **bowlers**, a minimum of 146 wickets was generally required for inclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. However, for the last 10 spots on the list of 54 sorted **bowlers**, pacers with between 100 and 146 wickets were also considered and added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

## Tournament Rules and Gameplay
The participants followed specific rules during the knockout rounds:

*   **Voting**: Instead of voting for who to eliminate, participants wrote down the name of the player they wished to advance to the next round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Information Disclosure**: The adjusted statistical numbers (strike rate and economy) were only revealed for the **bowlers** who were eliminated from the tournament, not for those who advanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Reflections on the Structure
The hosts discussed the outcomes of the seeding and matchups:

*   The initial matchups in the first round were perceived as "chaotic" due to tough pairings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, such as Joel Garner versus Jasprit Bumrah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, and Shane Bond versus Kapil Dev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>.
*   Despite efforts for fairer seeding by ranking **bowlers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, some felt the matchups, especially in the round of 16, still led to surprising eliminations of highly-rated players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:04">[01:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:30">[01:00:30]</a>.
*   The approach to [[criteria_for_evaluating_odi_bowlers | evaluating bowlers]] and the overall structure, though organized, sometimes felt "random" in its outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:12">[01:13:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:24">[01:13:24]</a>.

Ultimately, Joel Garner was crowned the greatest **ODI** bowler of all time in this tournament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:01">[01:15:01]</a>.

The Indian Premier League (IPL) has seen numerous batters leave a significant mark on the tournament through their performance, consistency, and ability to influence match outcomes. A knockout-style competition was conducted to identify the [[greatest_ipl_batters | greatest IPL batters]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, using specific [[discussion_of_ipl_batter_criteria | criteria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a> to evaluate their impact.

## Evaluation Criteria for IPL Batters

The selection process for evaluating [[greatest_ipl_batters | IPL batters]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a> in the knockout competition involved several filters:
*   **Minimum Runs** A base filter of 1,000 runs was applied to include both older and newer batters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   **Impact Score** Players with an "impact" less than zero were removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Impact is defined as how much a batter changes the predicted score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, for example, hitting a six and increasing the predicted score from 160 to 163 results in a +3 impact on that ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **True Average and Strike Rate** Players with negative true average and true strike rate were also excluded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Notable Batters and Their IPL Impact

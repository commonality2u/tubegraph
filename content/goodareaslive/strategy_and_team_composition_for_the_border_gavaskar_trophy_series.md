The Border Gavaskar Trophy is highly anticipated, with many considering it "bigger than the Ashes now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. The series holds significant subplots, including India's attempt for a three-peat against Australia, Australia's desire for revenge, and crucial implications for [[World Test Championship final qualification | World Test Championship]] final qualification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Both teams are considered among the best in Test cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>, making the contest highly competitive. The series is also characterized by "feisty" exchanges and flaring tempers between the two sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

## Australia's Team Composition and Match Strategy

Australia faces a significant challenge with the absence of Cameron Green, a key pace-bowling all-rounder who previously batted at number four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. This absence disrupts Australia's balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

### Batting Order Adjustments
To address Green's absence, Australia has opted to move [[Strategy and decisionmaking in cricket | Steve Smith]] back to number four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Nathan McSweeney, who impressed against India A, is set to open the batting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. This is a "stop-gap solution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>, as McSweeney typically bats at three or four in first-class cricket, averaging 45 at three and 50 at five <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. His higher average is attributed to batting lower down the order in Australian conditions, where batting averages for top-order players have significantly dropped by 10 runs per wicket in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

Concerns exist regarding McSweeney's suitability as an opener, especially against a strong new ball attack like India's, if fully fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. The entire Australian top four, including Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne, and Steve Smith, is viewed as risky, despite Khawaja being the "most informed player" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. Other potential openers like Marcus Harris, Sam Konstas, or Cameron Bancroft were considered equally risky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>, making McSweeney's selection a pragmatic choice rather than an ideal one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.

Despite the individual struggles, Australia's batting lineup is designed around specific [[Player roles and strategies in T20 cricket | player roles and strategies in T20 cricket | player roles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>. Usman Khawaja is expected to consolidate at the start, followed by Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne. Travis Head and Mitch Marsh are expected to counterattack and accelerate the scoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>.

### Bowling Strength and Challenges
Australia's bowling attack is considered "sorted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>. The core quartet of Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, and Nathan Lyon are expected to play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>. Josh Hazlewood is highlighted as the most in-form seam bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. Over the last three years, Australia's bowling average is 26.57, slightly behind India's 24.52 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.

A major concern for Australia is the lack of a bowling all-rounder due to injuries to Cameron Green and Mitch Marsh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>. This means the four main bowlers will have to bowl a significant number of overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>. Aaron Hardie, another all-rounder option, is not in the squad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>.

### Pitch Conditions
Australian pitches have evolved to be more result-oriented, with the Kookaburra ball being reinforced, causing it to "act like a Dukes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. This has led to a significant drop in batting averages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>. The Optus Stadium pitch in Perth, hosting the first Test, is expected to have significant pace and bounce, favoring seam bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:18">[00:25:18]</a>. These "short" Test matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a> are generally seen as benefiting Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>.

## India's Team Composition and Strategy

India also faces a "host of issues" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a> regarding its team composition and strategy.

### Key Absentees and Batting Challenges
-   **Rohit Sharma:** Unavailable for the first Test in Perth due to personal reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>.
-   **Shubman Gill:** Suffered a fractured left thumb, making him unavailable. He was averaging 47.4 as first drop in the calendar year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>.
-   **Number Six Batter:** India is "not set on a number six batter," with options including Sarfaraz Khan, Dhruv Jurel, and KL Rahul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:25">[00:26:25]</a>.
-   **Cheteshwar Pujara:** The absence of batsmen like Pujara and Hanuma Vihari, known for tiring out opposition pace attacks, could be a concern, although the changing nature of Australian pitches may mitigate this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:12">[00:43:12]</a>.

A potential lineup for Perth given the absences could see Yashasvi Jaiswal opening with Ishan Kishan, followed by KL Rahul at number three, Virat Kohli, and Rishabh Pant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:52">[00:28:52]</a>. Dhruv Jurel is a strong contender for the specialist number six batting role based on his performances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>.

### Bowling Concerns
-   **Mohammed Shami:** Unavailable for at least the first two Tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a>. His absence is a "huge issue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:05">[00:46:05]</a> as he is considered crucial for his new and old ball capabilities in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>.
-   **Jasprit Bumrah:** India's success in the series is seen as heavily reliant on Jasprit Bumrah playing consistently and performing as the best bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>. India's reliance on one trusted seam bowler makes it "very hard" to win consistently in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>.
-   **Hardik Pandya:** His omission from the squad is considered a mistake, as he would have provided crucial flexibility as an all-rounder <a class="yt="t-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>.
-   **Kuldeep Yadav:** His status (out of favor, injured, or missing) is unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>.

In terms of pace bowling options, if Mohammed Shami is out, potential partners for Jasprit Bumrah include Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, and Akash Deep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>. A potential fast-bowling trio could be Bumrah, Siraj, and Prasidh Krishna, with Krishna having shown promise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a>.

For spin, Ravindra Jadeja is preferred over Ravichandran Ashwin or Washington Sundar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:15">[00:46:15]</a>. However, there are "murmurs" that Ashwin might be paired with Nitish Kumar Reddy, especially if Nitish is highly rated by the team management, as this offers flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>.

### Approach to Batting
India's batting approach is characterized by naturally aggressive players like Jaiswal and Sarfaraz, who play in a similar style to their T20 performances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:35">[00:44:35]</a>. This is distinct from [[Indias aggressive Test cricket strategies | 'Bazball']] which is a specific tactic that England adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:26">[00:44:26]</a>. The modern game means there's "always a ball with your name on it," encouraging players to score quicker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:14">[00:45:14]</a>.

## Overall Series Outlook
Given the issues faced by both teams, the series is expected to be tough, with the "luck goes with the home side at that point" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>. The first two Tests in Perth and Adelaide (pink ball) are seen as particularly crucial and potentially dangerous for India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>, especially with Mitchell Starc historically devastating with the pink ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>. These are considered "probably the worst start for a touring team" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>.

The series is likely to be "career-deciding" for some greats on both sides, and it might even see a retirement at the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:55">[00:34:55]</a>. Both teams are "very hungry" to win, with the [[World Test Championship final qualification | World Test Championship]] final qualification adding to the intensity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>. Australia is motivated by India's recent successes in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:48">[00:36:48]</a>, while India aims to complete a historic three-peat, which would be hailed as one of Indian cricket's biggest achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>.

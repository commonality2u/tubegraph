From: [[goodareaslive]] <br/> 

The [[india_vs_pakistan_match_analysis | India vs Pakistan match analysis]] saw a significant [[pakistans_batting_performance_critique | batting collapse]] from [[pakistans_cricket_strategy_and_performance_issues | Pakistan]], which effectively ended the game as a contest. The collapse occurred around the 30-over mark, where Pakistan was at 155 for two wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. After losing set batters Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan, nothing significant happened, and the game felt over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.

## Nature of the Collapse

The collapse was described as a "me collapse," meaning it wasn't due to over-attacking, exceptionally great bowling, a difficult pitch, swing, or external pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. While there were some good deliveries, such as Jasprit Bumrah's two excellent balls and Kuldeep Yadav's contributions, the collapse was not brought about by the pitch, swing, or pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. This internal failing was considered "a real real hard thing to be able to handle" and "completely killed this game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. Even before Mohammad Nawaz's dismissal, a score of 250 was far off and likely 50 runs under par for the wicket, which offered very little for bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

## Key Wickets and Misjudgments

### Babar Azam
Babar Azam was dismissed playing a "wrong shot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. The ball might have kept a little low and was too close to his body; he was only trying to get a single <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. Despite the wrong shot, it was still described as a good, fast ball that skidded on slightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:39:00">[14:39:00]</a>.

### Saud Shakeel
Saud Shakeel, known as a fantastic player of spin, misjudged a ball that skidded on, a common occurrence during the match, which he should have anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

### Shadab Khan
Shadab Khan's dismissal was attributed to "pure bad luck," as he dragged the ball back onto his stumps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>. It was outside leg stump and not expected to spin back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.

### Iftikhar Ahmed
Iftikhar Ahmed was bowled on his stumps while playing a sweep shot off his hands, which was noted as a "brilliant ball" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.

### Mohammad Nawaz
Mohammad Nawaz, batting with the tail, made a mistake and went "a bit hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

## Indian Bowling Performance

The Indian bowling attack played a role in capitalising on [[challenges_faced_by_pakistans_batting_lineup | Pakistan's batting errors]]:

*   **Mohammed Siraj:** After conceding 12 runs in his first over, Siraj pulled back his length, giving away only 15 runs in his next four overs and taking Abdullah Shafique's wicket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>. He is seen as bowling full to chase wickets, even if it leads to loose balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. Siraj, like many Indian bowlers, is very effective at getting wickets via bowled or LBW dismissals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.
*   **Jasprit Bumrah:** Bumrah's off-cutter delivery was highlighted as "ridiculously high quality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>. It was described as an off-spinner at 80 mph, pitching outside off stump and hitting the top of off stump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>. This ball was deemed nearly unplayable, with perfect deception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>.
*   **Kuldeep Yadav:** Kuldeep has an "extraordinary low average" against Pakistan, having picked up 12 wickets in six games against them in major tournaments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>. He is now considered "world class" and beat Saud Shakeel with flight and delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44:00">[11:44:00]</a>.
*   **Ravindra Jadeja and Hardik Pandya:** Their combined efforts accounted for 4 wickets for 72 runs from 15.5 overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>. Hardik Pandya is considered the World Cup's strongest sixth bowler, and Ravindra Jadeja is arguably the strongest fifth bowler outside of South Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:39:00">[12:39:00]</a>. This combination of two all-rounders is seen as an "incredible" and "very very underrated" strength for India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:00">[14:02:00]</a>.

## [[pakistans_cricket_strategy_and_performance_issues | Pakistan's Broader Performance Issues]]

While the batting collapse was crucial, broader issues for [[pakistans_cricket_strategy_and_performance_issues | Pakistan's cricket strategy and performance issues]] were highlighted:

*   **Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan Partnership:** Babar Azam's innings was considered a positive, as he "looked like Babar again" after struggling since the Asia Cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:52:00">[14:52:00]</a>. The partnership between Babar and Rizwan, though not as prolific in ODIs as in T20s, is ideally suited for One Day International cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:38:00">[15:38:00]</a>. Pakistan looked like "two different teams today" â€“ fantastic with them, and not so much after their dismissals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07:00">[16:07:00]</a>.
*   **Bowling Weaknesses:** [[role_of_pakistans_bowling_and_fielding_in_the_match | Pakistan's bowling and fielding in the match]] had high economy rates, which was acceptable if wickets were taken, but they "do not look like taking wickets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:44:00">[16:44:00]</a>. The team lacked "Plan B, C, and D" when the ball wasn't swinging for Shaheen Shah Afridi or wobbling for Hasan Ali <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:13:00">[17:13:00]</a>.
    *   **Shaheen Shah Afridi:** He appeared to lack 100% energy and comfort, with the ball not coming out correctly from his hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:32:00">[18:32:00]</a>. He is described as a "one-dimensional bowler," very good at what he does (swing) but lacking the variation of other top bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:34:00">[28:34:00]</a>.
    *   **Hasan Ali:** Struggles if the ball doesn't seam, and is not as quick as Siraj <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:06:00">[18:06:00]</a>.
    *   **Haris Rauf:** Needs the ball to be older to be effective and looked lost early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:50:00">[17:50:00]</a>. His bowling is not coming out of his hand correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:40:00">[17:40:00]</a>.
*   **Impact of Naseem Shah's Absence:** The absence of Naseem Shah, an "absolutely incredible bowler," is a significant blow to the attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:50:00">[18:50:00]</a>.
*   **Reliance on Batters:** Pakistan's current state requires their batters to score "above par" because the bowlers are "not good enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:31:00">[19:31:00]</a>. Historically, the best Pakistan teams had batters scoring par, while bowlers made that par score seem "ridiculously hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:38:00">[19:38:00]</a>.

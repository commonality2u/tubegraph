India's cricketing schedule is packed, with the team set to play 10 Test matches in the next three and a half months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>. This intensive schedule has prompted discussions about player rotation, particularly concerning the seam bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>.

## Jasprit Bumrah's Workload Management

Following India's victory over Bangladesh in the first Test, it is expected that Jasprit Bumrah will be rested for the second Test in Kanpur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>. The logic is that if India secured a win in the first match, that was the intended Test for Bumrah to play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>. The pitch in Kanpur is anticipated to be black soil, which tends to be flatter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>, and a bowler like Bumrah would typically prefer a wicket with more assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>.

Resting Bumrah is crucial given the upcoming series, including three Tests against New Zealand and five in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>. Ideally, he should play at most another two Test matches before the Australian series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>. From a management perspective, consulting the player on his comfort with workload—whether he needs more or less bowling—and considering the specific pitch conditions is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>. If Bumrah remains fit for all five Tests in the upcoming [[Indias performance and strategies in Test Cricket | Australia]] series, it could significantly alter the series dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:53">[00:39:53]</a>.

## Hardik Pandya's Potential Inclusion

Hardik Pandya is currently preparing for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy (likely referring to the upcoming series in Australia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:08">[00:44:08]</a>. His inclusion would be a significant advantage for the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>.

If Hardik plays, he would be best suited for the role of a fourth seamer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>. His bowling style, focusing on bouncers, makes him a more effective option in this role compared to someone like Shardul Thakur, whose main skills involve wobbling the ball and using the new ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:28">[00:44:28]</a>. While there is a risk of further injury to Hardik, who is already injury-prone and a valuable asset in limited-overs cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:41">[00:44:41]</a>, India's recent T20 World Cup win might mean missing the Champions Trophy would not be as significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:48">[00:44:48]</a>.

## Pakistan's Batting Struggles
Pakistan's batters demonstrated significant issues throughout the match, particularly between overs 10 and 25, scoring only 44 runs for no wicket loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. From overs 10 to 20, they managed 27 runs for no loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This slow scoring rate was described as being more effective than tranquilizers for insomniacs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. They scored less than three runs per over for 15 overs after a decent start in the power play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

### Individual Batting Performances
*   **Babar Azam** was dismissed with a "floaty one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. He is currently in a "woeful touch of form" and is being asked to change his position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. He has become a "five boundary player" with an "attractive score in the 20s" or a slow 90-ball 64, often playing many dot balls or getting out trying to attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. He is considered "Fallen ODI royalty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.
*   **Imam-ul-Haq** ran himself out, doing himself "no favors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. Earlier, he hit the ball straight to mid-on and ran, which was a "suicidal run" taking on [[Performance and impact of key players in the World Cup final | Axar Patel's]] arm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. If he had played a great innings, scoring 70 off 100, he wouldn't have put pressure back on India, potentially resulting in a slightly higher score for Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   **Mohammad Rizwan** was dropped but got out immediately after <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. He often goes into a shell when needing to rotate strike and gets out when trying to attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Rizwan has "only two gears: third gear and slugging" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. He struggled to catch up with the required run rate, particularly against pace bowling where his strike rate was 42 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. He was at one point 16 runs off 41 balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.
*   **Saud Shakeel** was considered Pakistan's best batter, displaying various sweep shots (paddles, conventional, reverse) and pulling [[Role and Impact of Allrounders in Test Cricket Teams | Hardik Pandya]] for four, but then attempted an aerial pull and got out after being dropped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.

## Pakistan's Bowling and Fielding
Pakistan's bowling attack, while seemingly strong on paper, has been ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. They dropped two catches, including a high-flying edge from [[Performance and impact of key players in the World Cup final | Virat Kohli]] to third man that [[Role and Impact of Allrounders in Test Cricket Teams | Naseem Shah]] didn't properly effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>.

### Key Bowlers
*   **Shaheen Shah Afridi** cleaned up Rohit Sharma with a "worldly of a Yorker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. However, he was "absolutely thrashed the rest of the time," conceding 2 for 74 in 8 overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. Indian batters were treating him "like a spinner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. [[Role and performance of key players like Bumrah Shami and Gill in the World Cup | Shubman Gill]] "pulverized" him, and [[Performance and impact of key players in the World Cup final | Virat Kohli]] charged him down the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. Shaheen is supposed to be the attack leader but didn't seem so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>. He also had a questionable review during his batting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. His current form is compared to "Ben Dorus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.
*   **Haris Rauf** was described as "built in a lab to bowl to Virat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:55">[00:33:55]</a>. He bowls at 88-92 mph, doesn't move the ball sideways, and often over-pitches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a>. Haris hasn't recovered from "The Yips" yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>.
*   **Abrar Ahmed** was Pakistan's best bowler, taking 1 for 28 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
*   **Naseem Shah** was not incisive despite not being expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. [[Performance and impact of key players in the World Cup final | Virat Kohli]] had a strike rate of about 40 against him, which was the only bowler who was a "good match" for Kohli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>.
*   **Khushdil Shah** has been wrongly categorized as an all-rounder; he averages 83 with the ball in ODI cricket and has only four wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. He has bowled in less than half of his 15 ODIs, indicating he is not a frontline spinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

## India's Dominance
India "hammered" Pakistan by six wickets with 45 balls to spare in Dubai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

### Indian Player Performances
*   **Virat Kohli** scored an unbeaten 100, winning the game for India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a>. He was named player of the match for his 51st ODI century, surpassing Sachin Tendulkar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a>. He is the fastest to 14,000 runs and has the third most runs in international cricket behind Sachin Tendulkar and Kumar Sangakkara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:44">[00:32:44]</a>. Kohli has a strong record against Pakistan in ODIs, with 6 scores over 50 (four of which are centuries) in 17 innings, boasting a conversion rate of 66.7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:58">[00:32:58]</a>. His batting average against Pakistan in multinational tournaments is 81.4, the highest for a minimum of 1000 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>. He capitalized on his strengths, hitting four boundaries in the cover region and dominating Shaheen and Haris Rauf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>.
*   [[Role and Impact of Allrounders in Test Cricket Teams | Hardik Pandya]] bowled a crucial spell, taking 2 for 31 in 8 overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:59">[00:48:59]</a>. He was described as a "luxury in modern day Cricket" due to the balance he provides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:34">[00:48:34]</a>. Pandya is a "smart bowler" who understood the assignment, using pace off the ball and bowling back of a length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. He is considered an all-phase bowler capable of bowling with the new ball, in the middle overs, and at the death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:11">[00:51:11]</a>.
*   [[Role and performance of key players like Bumrah Shami and Gill in the World Cup | Mohammed Shami]] bowled well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   [[Role and performance of key players like Bumrah Shami and Gill in the World Cup | Shubman Gill]] scored 46 runs and by the time he was dismissed, the game was effectively over for Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:35:36]</a>. He "pulverized" Shaheen Afridi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:36">[00:37:36]</a>.
*   [[Role of key players in Indias cricket team | Shreyas Iyer]] scored 56 runs and has been consistently performing, improving his game against the short ball and being elite against spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>. He has one of the best averages in modern cricket history against ODI spinners, around 80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:15">[00:42:15]</a>. He is considered the "world's best number four" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:22">[00:42:22]</a>.
*   **Kuldeep Yadav** ended with figures of 3 for 40, though his wickets came when Pakistan was slogging at the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:04">[00:49:04]</a>.

### Overall Comparison
There is a significant [[Crucial Moments and Player Tactics in IND vs ENG | skill gap]] between the Indian and Pakistani teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:58">[00:23:58]</a>. Several Indian players not even in the main squad, such as Yashasvi Jaiswal, Ravi Bishnoi, Ruturaj Gaikwad, Mohammed Siraj (despite current form), Abhishek Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav (as a fringe player for Pakistan), Ayush Badoni, Sai Sudharsan, and Rahul Tripathi, would likely be selected for Pakistan's current team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>. India's depth allows them to drop top players like Jasprit Bumrah and Sanju Samson and still perform at a high level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>. In contrast, Pakistan lacks depth, particularly in all-rounders and quality spinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>.

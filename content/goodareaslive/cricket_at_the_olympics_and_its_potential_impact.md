The inclusion of cricket in the Olympic Games marks a significant development for the sport, aiming for broader global reach and increased participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:46">[00:56:46]</a>. It is considered an "athletic enough sport" to be part of the premier global sporting event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:51">[00:56:51]</a>.

## Inclusion in the Olympics

Cricket is confirmed to feature six male and six female teams at the Olympics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:20">[00:56:20]</a>. It is also understood that cricket will remain in the Olympics for at least two subsequent editions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:30">[00:56:30]</a>, with future editions possibly hosted in cricket-loving nations like Saudi Arabia or India, which would further solidify its presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:37">[00:56:37]</a>. This move is seen as the Olympics testing the waters to observe the traction and viewership cricket brings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>.

## Format and Player Participation
The T20 format of cricket is deemed suitable for an Olympic competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:55">[00:56:55]</a>. There is a suggestion that the T10 version of the game might be an even better fit for new audiences, such as the American public, due to its quick, "smash-bang boom" nature, completing a game in about an hour and a half, similar to baseball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.

Hopes are high that top players like Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, and Steven Smith could extend their careers to participate, which would significantly boost cricket's profile in the Olympics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:10">[01:00:10]</a>. Virat Kohli, in particular, is believed to be a major reason for cricket's Olympic inclusion, due to the immense media frenzy he generates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:41">[01:00:41]</a>.

## Potential Impact and Benefits

Cricket's presence in the Olympics is expected to make the sport "more global" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:16">[00:57:16]</a> and could provide a significant boost to many aspects of the game beyond the top nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:19">[01:00:19]</a>.

### Focus on Women's and Disability Cricket
The future of cricket at the Olympics is strongly linked to women's cricket and securing more funding for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:02">[00:58:02]</a>. Additionally, the inclusion could be transformative for disability cricket, which is currently "a horrendous job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:14">[00:58:14]</a> by cricket's governing bodies.

*   The ICC does not currently run disability cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:21">[00:58:21]</a>, and various organizations operate independently, leading to disorganization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:26">[00:58:26]</a>.
*   A "World Cup" for disability cricket in 2019 was not officially recognized by the ICC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:42">[00:58:42]</a>.
*   The Olympics' success in promoting disability sports, such as the Paralympics, offers a hopeful precedent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:53">[00:58:53]</a>.
*   Cricket has a historical connection to disability sport, with past games featuring "one-armed" teams versus "one-leg" teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.
*   Volunteers have maintained disability cricket for decades, but a centralized system would greatly aid its development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a>. Just as the ICC's involvement propelled women's cricket, a similar structure is needed for disability cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a>.

### Market Expansion
The LA 2028 organizers are excited about cricket as a new mass sport that Americans are largely unaware of, but recognize its global scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:25">[01:01:25]</a>. Its Olympic presence will compel engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:51">[01:01:51]</a>. The Indian team's participation is also viewed as a PR opportunity to support India's bid for future Olympic hosting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:31">[00:57:31]</a>.

### Associate Nations
Greater support for associate nations is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:21">[01:17:21]</a>. Programs like the Big Bash's initiative to have associate players train with teams can greatly aid player development and understanding of professionalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:26">[01:17:26]</a>. A rule allowing an extra overseas slot for an associate player in leagues like the IPL could also benefit these nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:50">[01:17:50]</a>.

## Challenges and Concerns

A minor concern was the initial decision for only six teams, with a preference for eight or ten teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:23">[00:59:23]</a>. The participation of players like [[impact_of_ipl_on_player_performance_and_intercountry_cricket_dynamics|Virat Kohli]] and [[impact_of_ipl_on_player_performance_and_intercountry_cricket_dynamics|Rohit Sharma]], who have retired from some T20 formats, is uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>.

The [[debate_on_the_relevance_and_future_of_odi_cricket|future of ODI cricket]] beyond 2036 is also brought into question, with the possibility of it becoming solely a "World Cup" event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>. One suggestion for [[debate_on_the_relevance_and_future_of_odi_cricket|ODI cricket's future]] was a two-innings, 25-overs per side format, but it is acknowledged that the game is already complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:58">[01:02:58]</a>.

## Cricket's Role in Global Sport
Unlike American sports that extend their game times, Test cricket is naturally built for prolonged engagement, which is beneficial for streaming platforms that aim to keep viewers for long durations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:38">[01:28:38]</a>.

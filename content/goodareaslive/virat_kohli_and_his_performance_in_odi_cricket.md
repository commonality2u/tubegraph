[[virat_kohlis_batting_strategy_and_records | Virat Kohli]] is celebrated for creating incredible moments on the cricket ground, including his MCG six against Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These memorable performances contribute to his iconic status among cricket fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## ODI Chasing Prowess
[[virat_kohlis_chasing_statistics_and_strategies | Virat Kohli]] is regarded as the best chaser in ODI history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. His chasing abilities are considered to be in a different realm compared to other notable players like Bevan and Dhoni <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. His technique ensures he doesn't fall far behind the required run rate, which is a key differentiator in his [[virat_kohlis_chasing_record_and_techniques | chasing approach]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

### Ideal Conditions for a Chase
Conditions are often described as "perfectly set up" for [[virat_kohlis_chasing_statistics_and_strategies | Kohli]] in chases due to factors like:
*   **Large grounds**: Allowing him to easily score singles and twos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   **Pitches conducive to staying in**: Making it easier to bat through without forcing the pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   **Subpar bowling attacks**: Less pressure to take aggressive risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

In a recent chase against Australia, the situation was described as a "6.8 Chase," meaning the batting team would expect to win approximately 66% of the time, making it an ideal scenario for [[virat_kohlis_chasing_statistics_and_strategies | Kohli]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

## Batting Performance Analysis
Despite being an elite chaser, [[virat_kohlis_batting_strategy_and_records | Kohli]]'s recent dismissal short of his century was surprising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. He typically plays such shots but usually hits them squarer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. His scoring is heavily dependent on the leg side, with Australia struggling to keep him off strike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

### Strike Rate and Scoring Shots
His strike rate varies by bowling type:
*   Against spin: He went at 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
*   Against pace: He played more defensively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

Key observations about his scoring:
*   **Dot ball percentage**: 33% today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. In T20 cricket, anything under 30% is considered elite, making 33% in one-day cricket "really, really high" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   **Runs from twos**: The speaker noted surprise that he didn't get more runs from twos, suggesting he might have avoided risking run-outs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   **Sixes**: His percentage of sixes in the first innings is 38% below expectations for the balls he faces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. However, this jumps "quite a bit" in a chase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
*   **Boundaries in Chase**: [[virat_kohlis_chasing_statistics_and_strategies | Kohli]] is significantly better at hitting boundaries in the chase compared to other situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

### Comparison with Steve Smith
In contrast to Steve Smith, whose innings often get stuck and require risky shots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>, [[virat_kohlis_batting_strategy_and_records | Kohli]] has an ability to consistently tick the scoreboard over, similar to Eoin Morgan and Joe Root, ensuring runs are always flowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

## Overall Standing in ODI Cricket
According to "Zulu numbers" for Indian players with a minimum of 2,000 runs in ODIs, [[virat_kohlis_batting_strategy_and_records | Virat Kohli]] is positioned among a strong crop of players, including Shubman Gill and Rohit Sharma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. His career has seen him become one of the best ODI players.

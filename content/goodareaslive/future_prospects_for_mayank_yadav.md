From: [[goodareaslive]] <br/> 

[[mayank_yadavs_cricket_career | Mayank Yadav]] is a young Indian fast bowler who gained significant attention after bowling just 73 deliveries in his first two IPL games, reaching speeds of 155-156 kph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. His emergence has sparked considerable excitement, particularly given the rarity of such pace in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.

## Early Career and Background
[[mayank_yadavs_cricket_career | Mayank Yadav]] hails from Sonnet Club in Delhi, one of India's most famous academies, which has produced players like Ashish Nehra, Shikhar Dhawan, Rishabh Pant, and Manoj Prabhakar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. He joined the club around the age of 13 or 14 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. His current coach at Sonnet noted that he possessed "that zip" from the moment he started bowling, confirming that his potential for speed was quickly evident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.

Despite his natural pace, [[mayank_yadavs_cricket_career | Mayank Yadav]] was not widely known during his development years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. This obscurity may be attributed to a combination of factors:
*   **Injuries**: He has had frequent injuries throughout his domestic career, limiting his playing time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>.
*   **Wicket-Taking Prolificacy**: His name might not have been heard much unless he was consistently picking wickets, and it's unclear if he was prolific in junior cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>.
*   **U19 World Cup Miss**: He missed out on the U19 World Cup squad, which in India is often a benchmark for a prospect's recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>.

He was picked up by Lucknow in 2022 at his base price of around 20 lakh (approximately $20,000-$25,000 USD), indicating he wasn't a highly hyped prospect at that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.

## IPL Impact
[[mayank_yadavs_cricket_career | Mayank Yadav]] made his IPL debut in the 2024 season, having missed the previous season due to a hamstring injury during practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.

### Debut vs. Punjab Kings
In his first game on March 30th against Punjab Kings, he was brought in to bowl the 10th over with Punjab at 88 without loss chasing 200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>. Although his first over went for 10 runs, batters Shikhar Dhawan and Jonny Bairstow were noticeably rushed by his pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>. His wickets, all from short balls, demonstrated that batters struggled to cope with his speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>. He finished with figures of 3 for 27, completely changing the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>.

### Performance vs. RCB
His second game against Royal Challengers Bangalore was even more impressive, where he recorded speeds of 156.4 kph and took 3 for 14 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>. He dismissed high-profile international batters like Rajat Patidar, Glenn Maxwell, and Cameron Green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>. Observations from these games include:
*   Faf du Plessis's footwork suggesting he was backing away from the pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.
*   Glenn Maxwell's typically fast hands appearing slow against [[mayank_yadavs_cricket_career | Mayank Yadav]]'s short ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>.
*   Anuj Rawat noticeably walking across his stumps and shortening his backlift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>.
*   Batters hitting him "all the way back on the stumps" due to being rushed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>.
*   Cameron Green, who grew up on fast Perth wickets, appearing to have his feet "in the toilet" and being completely bowled, which was seen as phenomenal cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>.

The impact of his pace seems to be more pronounced, possibly due to a "skiddy action" that rushes the batters, making him harder to pick up compared to bowlers with cleaner actions like Brett Lee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:20:00">[13:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:22:00">[13:22:00]</a>.

## Physical Challenges and Injuries
After his two impactful games, [[mayank_yadavs_cricket_career | Mayank Yadav]] has faced significant injury setbacks. He left his third game with an abdominal strain and later returned to bowl three overs against Mumbai Indians before taking a wicket and walking off with a lower side strain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:14:00">[16:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:17:00">[16:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:20:00">[16:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26:00">[16:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:27:00">[16:27:00]</a>. In the last two years of IPL alone, he has suffered a lower side strain, an abdominal strain, and a hamstring strain within the span of 73 deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:31:00">[16:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:33:00">[16:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:35:00">[16:35:00]</a>.

This injury record highlights the biggest issue at the moment: his physical ability to bowl consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:42:00">[16:42:00]</a>. His first-class career has been limited to one game, where he bowled 104 balls and took two wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:53:00">[16:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:56:00">[16:56:00]</a>. While his List A (822 balls, 34 wickets at 21) and T20 (8,000 balls, bowling average of 14) figures are impressive, his overall bowling workload is very low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:01:00">[17:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:05:00">[17:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:13:00">[17:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:15:00">[17:15:00]</a>.

## Comparison to Other Fast Bowlers
[[mayank_yadavs_cricket_career | Mayank Yadav]] is compared to other express pace bowlers:
*   **Umran Malik**: While Malik also generated excitement, he was considered more erratic than [[mayank_yadavs_cricket_career | Mayank Yadav]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.
*   **Mark Wood and Anrich Nortje**: These international pacers bowl at similar speeds, but [[mayank_yadavs_cricket_career | Mayank Yadav]]'s ball feels quicker, possibly because he "skids it off the pitch" rather than "banging it in," which allows the pace to be maintained more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:00">[14:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:00">[14:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:00">[14:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:21:00">[14:21:00]</a>.
*   **Shamar Joseph**: Shares similar issues of being very young, physically undeveloped, and not having bowled much, yet his deliveries feel like they are "rushing" the batter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:26:00">[17:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:27:00">[17:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:31:00">[17:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:36:00">[17:36:00]</a>.
*   **Pat Cummins**: An example of a fast bowler who debuted young but only started playing regularly around age 24, suggesting that taking time to build physical resilience can be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:50:00">[17:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:45:00">[18:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:47:00">[18:47:00]</a>.

## Future Prospects and Management
The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) recognizes [[mayank_yadavs_cricket_career | Mayank Yadav]] as a "precious commodity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:21:00">[18:21:00]</a>. There's a strong emphasis on not rushing him into play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:30:00">[18:30:00]</a>, with the understanding that even a year or two of dedicated physical conditioning is worthwhile to make his body as strong as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:57:00">[18:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:00:00">[19:00:00]</a>. He is currently at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bangalore for recovery and management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.

His future in different formats is uncertain:
*   **Red Ball Cricket**: It is too early to assess his potential in Test cricket, as his accuracy and endurance in that format are unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:40:00">[20:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:43:00">[20:43:00]</a>.
*   **Limited Overs Cricket**: Based on what has been seen so far, if he can maintain fitness and be managed effectively, he is considered a significant asset for India in limited overs formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:58:00">[20:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:01:00">[21:01:00]</a>.

There is no rush to get him back into the national setup, especially given India's settled bowling attack with Jasprit Bumrah, Hardik Pandya, Mohammed Siraj, and Mohammed Shami <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:50:00">[22:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:52:00">[22:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:53:00">[22:53:00]</a>. The BCCI has also started giving out fast bowling contracts, indicating a strategic effort to build a pool of fast bowlers for the [[future_prospects_for_indian_cricket_team_post_current_era | future prospects for Indian cricket team post current era]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:02:00">[22:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:04:00">[22:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:52:00">[22:52:00]</a>.

### Challenges Ahead
A significant challenge is the potential for [[mayank_yadavs_cricket_career | Mayank Yadav]] to prioritize the IPL due to the financial incentives, which could lead to him "saving himself" for the league <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:19:00">[19:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:23:00">[19:23:00]</a>. His current status means he needs to play for India in domestic and international matches to be considered for events like the Champions Trophy or T20 World Cup, as these tournaments occur before the IPL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:06:00">[23:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:12:00">[23:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:21:00">[23:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:23:00">[23:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:26:00">[23:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:30:00">[23:30:00]</a>.

Despite the excitement surrounding his initial performances, it is acknowledged that a "second or third season" is required to make a more accurate assessment of his long-term prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:30:00">[21:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:32:00">[21:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:34:00">[21:34:00]</a>.

## Optimism for the Future
There is greater optimism now regarding the management of fast bowlers in India compared to 15 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:01:00">[25:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:04:00">[25:04:00]</a>. The success in managing bowlers like Bumrah, Mohammed Shami, and Mohammed Siraj suggests India now has better know-how for handling fast bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:18:00">[25:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:20:00">[25:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:23:00">[25:23:00]</a>. With experts like Bharat Arun and Paras Mhambrey having worked at the NCA, and Troy Cooley also involved, there's a strong belief that the best can be extracted from [[mayank_yadavs_cricket_career | Mayank Yadav]] once he's consistently fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:33:00">[25:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:36:00">[25:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:38:00">[25:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:40:00">[25:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:45:00">[25:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:49:00">[25:49:00]</a>.

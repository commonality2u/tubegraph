[[india_vs_england_4th_test_match_highlights_and_analysis | England]] began Day 1 of the 5th Test facing Jasprit Bumrah's challenging deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Despite Crawley seeming to play almost exclusively with the outside or leading edge, Bumrah did not secure a wicket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. [[india_vs_england_4th_test_match_highlights_and_analysis | England]]'s willingness to punish, even with edges, meant the ball often found gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The opening partnership was described as potentially the "most grown-up Bazball opening partnership" seen in some time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

At lunch, [[india_vs_england_4th_test_match_highlights_and_analysis | England]] had lost two wickets, a result they were likely still unhappy with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. India's bowling, particularly from Kuldeep Yadav, was noted for its smartness, with his "wrong'uns" playing a significant role in several dismissals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## England's Batting Collapse

Despite a solid start, [[india_vs_england_4th_test_match_highlights_and_analysis | England]] "completely destroyed" their advantage later in the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Key batters were described as playing "incredibly loose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

*   **Jonny Bairstow** was convinced he needed to score a hundred in 30 balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. He struggled to pick the wrong'un, and despite playing well earlier, chose to force aggression against the wrong shot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
*   **Zak Crawley** played around one "for no real reason" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. His dismissal came from Kuldeep tossing the ball up above his eye line, waiting for Crawley to play a specific shot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   **Ben Duckett** hooked across the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. His dismissal to Kuldeep was a wide ball outside off-stump that he tried to hit to the leg side, which was a clear mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   **Ollie Pope** tried to come down the wicket but didn't realize it was a wrong'un, and was nowhere near the pitch of the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
*   **Ben Stokes** failed to pick the wrong'un <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. An earlier wrong'un from Kuldeep had been left by Stokes, who then realized he hadn't picked it, setting up his dismissal in the next over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

> "The real problem now is that India just know they just have to wait. Earlier in the series they were shaken, now they're just patient. [[india_vs_england_4th_test_match_highlights_and_analysis | England]] don't bat for long to start games so all you need to do is sit back and wait for the innings to self-destruct on its own" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

## India's Response

After [[india_vs_england_4th_test_match_highlights_and_analysis | England]]'s collapse, Rohit Sharma and Yashasvi Jaiswal began their innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. [[india_vs_england_4th_test_match_highlights_and_analysis | England]]'s seamers struggled to move the new ball as much as India had in the morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. India never looked in much trouble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Jaiswal aimed to aggressively target Shoaib Bashir, playing a shot reminiscent of Ben Duckett, which ultimately led to his dismissal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

> "India are well in front" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## Key Player Analysis

### Kuldeep Yadav

Kuldeep Yadav's performance was highlighted, particularly his smart bowling and effective use of the wrong'un <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. The surface in Dharamshala, described as similar to an Adelaide Day 3 or Gabba Day 4 pitch with both spin and bounce/pace, was ideal for a wrist-spinner like Kuldeep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. His extra bounce is a significant asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

Kuldeep bowled slightly slower on Day 1, opting for his optimum pace of 81-85 km/h, which the pitch assisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. He has shown increased confidence and strategic thinking throughout the series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

### England's Batting Order Performance

A consistent issue for [[india_vs_england_4th_test_match_highlights_and_analysis | England]] in the [[performance_analysis_of_key_players_in_ind_vs_eng_series | series]] has been the performance beyond their openers.

*   **Openers (Ducket, Crawley)**: Averaged 42 across the series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Despite previous struggles against spin, they have looked "magnificent" in this [[performance_analysis_of_key_players_in_ind_vs_eng_series | series]] and play aggressively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
*   **Numbers 3-7**: Averaged 25 in the series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. This contrasts sharply with India's numbers 3-7 averaging 37, even with less experienced players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.
*   **The Middle Order (Root, Bairstow, Stokes, Foakes, Pope)**: This group, historically [[india_vs_england_4th_test_match_highlights_and_analysis | England]]'s strength, has not performed well on this tour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

> "The openers are doing a brilliant job and everyone else is not particularly scoring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

While openers are given freedom to score quickly, a mindset change is needed once they pass 40-run mark, to convert starts into bigger scores by reducing unnecessary risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. The blame for the middle-order collapses is placed on the players batting below the openers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

### Jasprit Bumrah's Non-Wicket Taking Spell

Bumrah's opening spell was described as potentially the "greatest non-wicket taking delivery in test history," creating an optical illusion with the ball angling in and then straightening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. Despite Bumrah swinging the ball in both directions, reverse swinging it, and getting wobble and seam movement, India's seamers could not find a wicket in the first session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>.

> "On another day... the amount of times that Crawley could a leaning Edge or spoon the ball up in the air and it just didn't go to a Fielder a normal day you just get one of those wickets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>.

### Yashasvi Jaiswal

Jaiswal joined an "incredible list" of players for being among the fastest to 1000 runs in men's Tests by number of matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>. He showed an ability to go into "modes" where he looks for specific types of deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>. Against Shoaib Bashir, Jaiswal faced 43% of his balls and scored 80% of his runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>. He notably hit a slog cover drive for six over deep cover from a wide ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>. His dismissal was considered an aggressive choice, giving up what could have been another hundred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:37">[00:28:37]</a>.

### Ben Stokes' Weakness Against Spin

Ben Stokes averages 28 against India from 2014-2024 and 21.8 across nine innings in this [[performance_analysis_of_key_players_in_ind_vs_eng_series | series]], indicating an "inherent weakness in playing quality spin bowling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08">[00:31:08]</a>. His bat path, coming from "second slip," creates a built-in problem against balls spinning away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a>. His best shot against spin, the slog sweep, is a high-risk shot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:13">[00:32:13]</a>. Stokes also tends to get trapped on the crease and often has to decide beforehand when to use his feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:29">[00:34:29]</a>. His average against spin is significantly lower in Asia compared to conditions where spin struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>.

### Jonny Bairstow in the 100-Test Club

Bairstow is considered to be in the "lower end" of the 100-Test club, not necessarily at the very bottom, but among the "low achievers" despite being a fantastic cricketer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. He's described as a "match winner" but with "many holes in his game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>.

## England's Over-Rate and Batting Overs

[[india_vs_england_4th_test_match_highlights_and_analysis | England]]'s "Bazball" approach leads to fewer overs being played in their batting innings, particularly in the first innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:20">[00:54:20]</a>. In the last two years of Test matches, [[india_vs_england_4th_test_match_highlights_and_analysis | England]] averages 73 overs in their first innings, second lowest only to Afghanistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:57">[00:54:57]</a>. This impacts their bowlers' recovery time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:23">[00:54:23]</a>. This batting style appears to be more problematic in the first innings where they don't have a clear plan, contrasting with their second innings where they are comfortable chasing a set target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:07">[00:55:07]</a>. [[india_vs_england_4th_test_match_highlights_and_analysis | England]] is the only team in the Bazball era to average more in the second innings than the first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:01">[00:56:01]</a>.

Unconventional bowlers, characterized by unique or low-slinging actions, present a significant challenge for batsmen, but they also face unique difficulties in their careers, particularly when their form dips.

## The Batting Challenge

Facing an unconventional bowler is inherently difficult because batsmen have spent their entire careers training to pick up deliveries coming from a high arm action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:52">[01:30:52]</a>. When a bowler like Lasith Malinga or Matheesha Pathirana bowls, the ball is released from a much lower trajectory, often appearing to come from the umpire's head, face, or chest region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:43">[02:08:43]</a>. This forces batsmen to "re-train" their eyes and adjust their focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:58">[01:36:58]</a>.

The challenge is not just the different release point but also the deceptive variations these bowlers can produce. Malinga, for instance, had "really deceptive" slower balls and floaters that were exceptionally difficult to pick up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.

Furthermore, the low action makes it very difficult for batsmen to hit them for sixes, as the angle often prevents them from getting "under" the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:10">[02:35:10]</a>. This was a hallmark of Pathirana's effectiveness in previous seasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:04">[02:57:04]</a>.

## Challenges for Unconventional Bowlers

Despite the difficulties they pose to batsmen, unconventional bowlers face significant [[Challenges for young cricket prodigies | challenges]] of their own, particularly when their form dips.

### Maintaining Form and Control
Unconventional bowlers often struggle with consistency and control, especially if their action changes. Pathirana, for example, has seen a noticeable change in his performance:
*   His sixes conceded per delivery have drastically increased from one every 31 deliveries in 2023 to one every 11 deliveries this year across all T20 cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:10">[02:49:10]</a>.
*   His median length has also changed from 6.8m to 4.6m, indicating a shift in his bowling strategy or an issue with control over his length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:54">[02:56:54]</a>.
*   This suggests that batters are now able to get "under him a little bit more" due to a slightly higher action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:07">[03:31:07]</a>.

### Limited Coaching and Mentorship
One of the most significant [[Challenges for young cricket prodigies | challenges]] is the scarcity of experienced coaches or mentors who understand and can effectively guide bowlers with such unique actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:17">[02:27:17]</a>.
> "If you play so differently to everyone else and you've got a method that isn't that doesn't sit completely the same with everyone else's, there aren't as many people that you can go to" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:17">[02:27:17]</a>.

For someone like Pathirana, the pool of potential mentors is extremely small, possibly limited to just Lasith Malinga and maybe Shaun Tait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. This makes it difficult to get tailored advice when making "slight tweak[s]" that can suddenly make them ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

### Psychological Impact
When an unconventional bowler's unique method stops working, it can lead to self-doubt. They might wonder if their previous success was merely "luck" or if "no one was picking me" before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>. This mental hurdle, combined with a lack of clear communication from coaches about specific mechanical issues (e.g., a 10cm change in release height), can hinder their ability to regain form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:54">[02:51:54]</a>.

### Transitioning to a Normal Bowler
If an unconventional bowler's action changes or their unique advantage is lost, they risk becoming a "normal bowler" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. This requires them to adapt their game, potentially losing the very element that made them successful. The need to adapt with cameras constantly on them adds another layer of [[Challenges for young cricket prodigies | pressure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

Unconventional bowlers like Pathirana, despite their talent, face a unique and arduous journey in professional cricket, balancing their distinctive style with the need for adaptability and specialized support.

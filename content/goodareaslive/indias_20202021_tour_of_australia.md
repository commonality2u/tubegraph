The 2020-21 Border Gavaskar Trophy series, which saw [[indias_dominance_in_ausvind_test_series | India tour Australia]], was highly regarded as one of the best Test series wins in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. It was considered a very high point for India, with many not predicting the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

## Series Overview and Key Moments
The series began poorly for India, as they were bowled out for just 36 runs in the first game in Adelaide, losing by eight wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. This low score was considered one of the most embarrassing moments in modern Indian cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

Following this initial defeat, Virat Kohli left the series to attend the birth of his child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Despite this, India demonstrated remarkable resilience in the subsequent matches:
*   **Boxing Day Test**: Ajinkya Rahane scored a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   **Sydney Test**: Ravichandran Ashwin and Hanuma Vihari batted valiantly for a draw, with Ashwin enduring multiple blows to his body and getting injured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
*   **Gabba Test**: Despite Tim Paine's pre-match taunt ("see you at the Gabba") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>, India arrived without key players like Jasprit Bumrah and Ashwin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. They were tasked with chasing 329 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Shubman Gill (91) and Rishabh Pant (89 not out) delivered outstanding performances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. Washington Sundar and Shardul Thakur also made significant contributions with both bat and ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. India secured the victory, ultimately redeeming the early setback of 36 all out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

## Significance
This series win was particularly impressive as India had lost many players to injury, while Australia was at full strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. India's previous series win in Australia (2018-19) had an "asterisk" due to the absence of Steve Smith and David Warner, but the 2020-21 victory solidified India's achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

> [!info] Impact of Injuries
> Historically, a run of injuries like India experienced typically leads to a team collapsing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. However, the opposite occurred, with players like T. Natarajan, who might not play another Test match, performing well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. This series became filled with incredible stories of resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

The Border Gavaskar Trophy 2020-21 series was a defining moment for [[indias_performance_and_strategies_in_recent_test_matches | Indian Test cricket]], marking a significant achievement against strong opposition on foreign soil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

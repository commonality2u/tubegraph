An emergency podcast episode of the Kimappa show discussed [[rohit_sharmas_test_retirement_and_its_impact_on_indian_cricket | Rohit Sharma's Test retirement]] [00:00:16]. The hosts expressed initial shock at the news, which was overheard during BBC commentary of the IPL [00:00:26].

## Timing of Test Retirement

The timing of [[rohit_sharmas_test_retirement_and_its_impact_on_indian_cricket | Rohit Sharma's Test retirement]] was unexpected [00:00:49]. It would have made more sense if the decision had been announced during or immediately after the Australian series, rather than months later [00:00:46].

One perspective suggests that he likely considered all factors and chose not to make an emotional decision when sentiments were running high during the Australian series, when people were calling for his slot and the team was not performing well [00:01:01]. A player would want to wait, think, and consider all aspects of their career, including the availability of other players to take over [00:01:23].

It is speculated that the sheer number of Test matches played, especially during a period of poor form, might have influenced his decision [00:02:06]. He would have considered whether he wanted to put in the immense work required to improve his game at his current age [00:02:17]. As a leader, he would also have considered the team's future and the upcoming youngsters [00:02:31].

## Performance Analysis

### Impact of Last Year's Form
[[rohit_sharmas_impact_and_batting_strategy | Rohit Sharma's Test career]] was described as incredible, particularly before his last year [00:02:46]. His final year significantly impacted his overall statistics [00:01:39]. He played 14 Test matches, his highest in any year, during a period of his worst form [00:01:49].

### Batting Position and Conditions
*   **Before Opening**: When not opening the batting, he averaged around 37-38 [00:04:53]. This period coincided with "the greatest batting era in probably Test cricket history" where "everyone was making runs" [00:05:00].
*   **As an Opener**: He started opening when scoring runs was more challenging [00:05:06]. Typically, Asian openers benefit from playing at home, but he opened on challenging Indian wickets where the ball was "ragging and bouncing sideways" [00:05:17]. Despite these difficult conditions, his overall record as an opener was strong [00:05:27].
*   **Statistical Adjustment**: His batting average, when adjusted for the low-scoring surfaces he played on, was only slightly lower than Chris Rogers' [00:05:57]. However, his impact on games was much greater due to his scoring speed and centuries on difficult pitches [00:06:01].

### Performance on Challenging Wickets
[[rohit_sharmas_performance_as_an_opener | Rohit Sharma's performance as an opener]] was notable on tougher wickets [00:17:33].
> "on on tougher wickets he just kind of switched on better and then I think he he fierce focused better and was it was fascinating the way he performed." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>

He had an "insane ability" to perform well on difficult tracks, much like Manish Pandey in first-class cricket [00:17:24]. He would often excel in low-scoring games where other batters struggled [00:17:49]. For instance, he was seen pulling fast bowlers like Hazlewood, Starc, and Cummins off the front foot with a brand new ball, hitting sixes in the first 15 overs in Australia [00:17:56].

### Opening Statistics (2019-2023)
In the 26 Test matches he opened between 2019 and 2023, he averaged 51 [00:15:32]. This highlights the significant drop in his average due to his poor form in the 14 matches he played in his last year [00:15:39]. Furthermore, when the overall batting average on a venue was under 30, [[rohit_sharmas_impact_and_batting_strategy | Rohit Sharma]] performed "twice as good as the other top six players" in those games [00:16:13].

## [[impact_of_captaincy_on_rohit_sharmas_career_and_performance | Impact of Captaincy on Rohit Sharma's Career and Performance]]

The decision for a captain to drop themselves, especially as the Indian Test captain during a struggling series, is incredibly difficult [00:19:46].
*   **Emotional Factor**: Indians are described as very emotional people, which impacts players [00:20:04].
*   **Care for the Team**: [[impact_of_captaincy_on_rohit_sharmas_career_and_performance | Rohit Sharma]] is seen as a leader who genuinely cares about the team's well-being [00:20:29].
*   **Inclusivity and Communication**: His leadership is characterized by inclusivity, elevating players, and excellent communication [00:20:43].

### Leadership Anecdote
Sanju Samson shared a story demonstrating [[impact_of_captaincy_on_rohit_sharmas_career_and_performance | Rohit Sharma's leadership quality]]. Before the T20 World Cup final, a narrative suggested Samson might play instead of Shivam Dube [00:21:12]. After the toss, even with India batting first and only 20-25 minutes to get ready, [[rohit_sharmas_impact_and_batting_strategy | Rohit Sharma]] sat down with Samson for about 10 minutes [00:21:35]. He apologized and explained that his decision to maintain continuity was based purely on instinct, acknowledging Samson's anticipation to play [00:21:47]. This act, taking time to communicate with a player who hadn't played a single game in the World Cup, showcased "pure leadership quality" [00:22:16].

### Decision to Drop Himself
His decision to drop himself was likely rooted in doing what he believed was right for the team, especially given his struggles with batting form [00:22:32]. This period also involved existential questions about his career, including whether to retire completely [00:22:40].

## [[rohit_sharmas_fitness_and_future_in_international_cricket | Rohit Sharma's Fitness and Future in International Cricket]]

Despite his Test retirement, [[rohit_sharmas_fitness_and_future_in_international_cricket | Rohit Sharma]] still has one-day cricket left and is expected to have longevity in that format, which is considered his best [00:02:48]. This decision to prioritize ODIs allows him more time to focus on his health and fitness [00:03:37]. The goal is for him to last until the next 50-over World Cup, which both he and Virat Kohli aspire to win [00:07:45].

It is suggested that his T20i retirement was an emotional decision made after winning the T20 World Cup, which must have been a significant burden [00:03:31]. In hindsight, he might have preferred to continue playing that format due to its suitability to his style [00:03:50].

International cricketers, especially leaders, deal with immense emotional and mental pressure, scrutiny, and criticism [00:11:34]. After a high-intensity career, many players feel "spent" and prefer to close that chapter rather than consistently engage in cricket commentary or analysis [00:13:06]. This sentiment applies to players like [[rohit_sharmas_impact_and_batting_strategy | Rohit Sharma]], Virat Kohli, and MS Dhoni [00:12:36].

## Batting Style and Technique

[[rohit_sharmas_impact_and_batting_strategy | Rohit Sharma's batting]] was always admired for the "so much time" he seemed to have before playing the ball [00:25:20]. This ability, though partly natural, was also nurtured through development [00:25:32]. Key aspects of his technique include:
*   The pull shot off his front foot [00:25:38].
*   His ability to innovate [00:25:43].
*   His cover drive against the fastest bowlers [00:25:46].
*   His simple, naturally gifted batting style [00:25:54].
*   His "proportions" as a batter, including height, hand positioning, and the timing of his "push back," which collectively helped him create time [00:26:06].

## Was He Made a Test Opener Too Late?

The question arises whether [[rohit_sharmas_performance_as_an_opener | Rohit Sharma]] started opening in Tests too late [00:27:19]. It is recalled that he likely became an opener when a spot opened due to injury or a lack of other options, with MS Dhoni suggesting he try it [00:27:28]. He then thrived in that role, particularly at his favorite venue, Eden Gardens [00:27:41].

Some players, like Shane Watson or Justin Langer, find their true potential as batters later in their careers, and the opening slot happens to be the available position [00:31:10]. This suggests that their success as openers might be more about their overall development as players than solely their suitability for the opening role from early on [00:31:30].

## Addressing Criticisms

Regarding the claim that [[rohit_sharmas_impact_and_batting_strategy | Rohit Sharma]] "sucked at Test cricket", it is strongly refuted [00:36:51]. His average of 50 in 26 Test matches as an opener between 2019-2023, during a period when runs were difficult to score, demonstrates his high performance [00:37:00]. It is acknowledged that he was "out of form at the end" (2024), a point that [[rohit_sharmas_impact_and_batting_strategy | Rohit Sharma]] himself, having dropped himself, would likely agree with [00:37:07].

## Future Test Captaincy

The discussion briefly touched upon potential future Test captains for India, with Jasprit Bumrah being a strong contender due to interest in his tactical abilities [00:35:05]. However, there are concerns about the physical toll on a fast bowler serving as captain, which might lead them to play when not fully fit [00:35:14]. Other names mentioned include KL Rahul and Shubman Gill, with the idea of a younger player like Gill being second-in-command to Bumrah [00:35:31].

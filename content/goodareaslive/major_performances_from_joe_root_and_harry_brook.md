The Multan Test between England and Pakistan in 2024 showcased remarkable batting displays, particularly from [[joe_roots_batting_and_shot_selection | Joe Root]] and Harry Brook, whose record-breaking partnership was central to England's victory.

## Joe Root's Stellar Performance

Joe Root delivered a phenomenal performance, scoring 262 runs, his highest Test score to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:11">[01:04:11]</a>. This innings allowed him to surpass Alastair Cook as England's highest-ever run-scorer in Test cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:19">[01:04:19]</a>. As a result, Root is now the fifth-highest run-scorer in the history of Test cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:24">[01:04:24]</a>. During this Test match, he also completed 20,000 international runs for England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:28">[01:04:28]</a>.

His century in Multan was his first in Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:54">[01:04:54]</a> and his second overall against Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. A notable statistic is that every time Root scores a century against Pakistan, he converts it into a 250+ score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:03">[01:05:03]</a>.

Root's [[cricket_and_player_performances | batting prowess]] has been exceptional, particularly since 2021, during which he has scored 18 Test tons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:42">[01:04:42]</a>. This figure is higher than the combined 17 tons scored by Steve Smith, Virat Kohli, and Kane Williamson in the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:45">[01:04:45]</a>. He is widely regarded as the greatest Test batter in contemporary cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:21">[01:05:21]</a>, showing significant improvement in his conversion rate of centuries into big scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:02">[01:08:02]</a>. His fitness is described as "insane," as he has barely missed a Test for England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:31">[01:05:31]</a>. After fielding for 149 overs, he batted for 136 overs, demonstrating his endurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:49">[01:05:49]</a>.

Root's current form suggests he could potentially [[cricket_and_player_performances | overtake Sachin Tendulkar's Test run record]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>. In the current "Bazball 2.0" era, Root has reverted to his original template, focusing on accumulating bulk runs while others bat more aggressively around him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:19">[01:06:19]</a>. He is noted as the best player of spin for England in recent memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:56">[01:07:56]</a>. Despite cramping significantly during his innings, Root persevered, highlighting his professionalism and hunger for runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:53">[01:11:53]</a>.

While his captaincy was less effective, his improved batting form since stepping down from the captaincy has been a major boon for England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:17">[01:13:17]</a>. His wicket was eventually taken by Salman Agha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:21">[01:19:21]</a>. Earlier, he survived a close LBW shout against Naseem Shah and was dropped by Babar Azam at mid-wicket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:04">[00:50:04]</a>.

## Harry Brook's Record-Breaking Innings

Harry Brook was deservedly named player of the match for his extraordinary innings of 317 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:08">[00:58:08]</a>. He became only the second player in history to score a triple hundred after achieving his maiden double hundred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:12">[00:58:12]</a>. Brook is the sixth Englishman in Test cricket history to score a triple hundred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:27">[00:58:27]</a>.

He has a remarkable affinity for playing in Pakistan, stating he would "roll up the pitch and take it back home" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:32">[00:58:32]</a>. In his four Test matches there, he has scored a century in each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:35">[00:58:35]</a>, including centuries in his last three innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:38">[00:58:38]</a>. No non-Pakistan batter has scored more tons in Pakistan than Harry Brook in just six innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:44">[00:58:44]</a>. His 317 runs broke Virender Sehwag's record for the highest individual score in Multan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:56">[00:58:56]</a>.

Brook's career statistics highlight his dominance in Pakistan: 785 runs in six innings in Pakistan compared to 761 runs in 21 innings in England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:04">[00:59:04]</a>. Tim Nielsen, Pakistan's high-performance coach, noted that Pakistan's bowlers were afraid to bowl straight to him due to his ability to dominate the opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:17">[01:00:17]</a>. Brook possesses a wide array of shots, including charging down the track for sixes, powerful tennis-style forehands, drives, and sweeps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:30">[00:59:30]</a>.

Despite his range of shots, some observers question his temperament in T20 cricket, suggesting his technique and temperament are better suited for Test match greatness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:07">[01:00:07]</a>. Interestingly, Pakistan did not employ tactics that previously frustrated him, such as bowling wide outside off-stump, a strategy Sri Lanka successfully used against him earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:40">[01:01:40]</a>.

## Root and Brook's Partnership

The partnership between Root and Brook was extraordinary, contributing 454 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:21">[00:56:21]</a>. This stands as:
*   The fourth-largest partnership ever for any wicket in Test cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:26">[00:56:26]</a>.
*   The largest fourth-wicket partnership ever in Test cricket history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:28">[00:56:28]</a>.
*   The largest partnership for England ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:31">[00:56:31]</a>.
*   The largest partnership Pakistan have conceded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

Their combined score of 579 runs (262 by Root + 317 by Brook) in the first innings was more than Pakistan's entire first innings total of 556 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. This highlights the sheer dominance of their batting, particularly on a flat Multan pitch.

## England's Dominance and Pakistan's Struggles

England's collective batting performance in the Multan Test was historic. They scored 823 for 7 declared in 150 overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>, which is the fourth-highest total in Test cricket history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:05">[00:56:05]</a> and the highest in the 21st century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:12">[00:56:12]</a>. This score was achieved at a striking rate of 5.5 runs per over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:37">[00:43:37]</a>.

Despite Pakistan scoring 556 runs in their first innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:51">[00:42:51]</a>, they lost by an innings and 47 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. This marked the first time in 147 years of Test cricket that a team lost by an innings after posting a 500+ score in their first innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Pakistan's approach was in stark contrast to England's, as they hit 11 sixes to England's five, despite scoring significantly fewer runs overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:45">[00:44:45]</a>. This disparity suggested a lack of fitness or hunger in Pakistan's batting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:07">[00:45:07]</a>.

[[englands_bowling_performance_and_strategy | England's bowling attack]], considered inexperienced on paper for the conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, managed to take 19 wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Jack Leach, in particular, took seven wickets in the match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, equaling the total wickets taken by the entire Pakistan bowling attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. This was surprising given that [[analysis_of_joe_root_as_a_modern_part_time_bowler | Leach is not considered a top-tier spinner]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:57">[00:35:57]</a>.

The pitch itself was criticized as being too flat, making it difficult for bowlers to take wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:46">[00:47:46]</a>. Despite the flat track and numerous fielding errors by both teams (England dropping nine catches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:57">[00:47:57]</a>), England's strategic approach and relentless scoring rate ultimately secured a historic victory.

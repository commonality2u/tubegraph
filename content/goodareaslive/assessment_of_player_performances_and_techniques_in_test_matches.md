This article examines the [[player_performance_analysis_in_test_cricket | performance]] and techniques of key players in a recent Test match, drawing insights from commentary and statistical analysis.

## Pitch Conditions and Their Influence
The wicket in this match presented a challenging and at times "weird" playing surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. The ball sometimes kept low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, and cracks on the pitch were a significant feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. However, the cracks did not always play as expected, particularly for seam bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a>. The middle part of the day, when the sun was out, notably changed the wicket's behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. The wicket's behavior was inconsistent, making it fascinating to follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

## Player Performance Analysis

### Ravichandran Ashwin
Ashwin delivered an "absolutely outstanding" [[player_performance_and_potential_in_test_matches | performance]] despite prior questions about his age catching up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. He took wickets by bowling straight, not even needing the ball to spin or worry about the cracks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. He proved to be a "second innings new ball destroyer," rocking England's batting lineup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

His effectiveness with the new ball in India over the last five years is notable:
*   Against left-handers, he averages 16 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   His [[player_performance_analysis_in_test_cricket | performance]] in the third innings with the new ball is particularly strong, as it allows him to utilize his full range of skills, including skidding the ball through and generating inconsistent bounce and sideways spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. He is considered an "absolutely fantastic new ball bowler" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>, potentially the first truly great new ball spinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

Ashwin's proportion of new ball overs bowled in India has been around 30% over the last five years, dropping slightly to 25% in the current series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. Despite this, his effectiveness, particularly against Ben Duckett, suggests he should be given the new ball more often <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

### Kuldeep Yadav
Kuldeep Yadav's [[player_performance_and_potential_in_test_matches | career]] figures are impressive, though he was under-bowled in the first innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. His economy rate has significantly improved, with recent games demonstrating his ability to keep it down, something not seen from him previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. His Test cricket bowling average has remained remarkably flat over 11 matches, indicating consistent wicket-taking ability despite being in and out of the side and facing confidence issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.

Kuldeep's usage shows a plan:
*   He is utilized when there's a top-order batter who struggles against him or during flat periods to change the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.
*   He is also used against the tail-enders, which is considered a "perfect usage of a wrist spinner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.
*   However, with two other world-class spinners in the side, he often doesn't get as many overs as he might otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.

Kuldeep's [[player_performance_and_potential_in_test_matches | performance]] in the second innings saw him turn the ball significantly more than in the first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:51">[01:10:51]</a>. He appears to be a "much more rounder bowler" and smarter than before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>.

### Ben Duckett
Duckett consistently struggles against Ashwin, often getting caught at short cover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. His technique involves trying to protect his outside edge, leading him to get slightly inside the ball when playing forward defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. While he famously stated his reverse sweep was as good as his defense, it's suggested his reverse sweep is "probably better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>, and 55% of his runs come from sweep shots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:17">[01:13:17]</a>.

### Ollie Pope
Pope has an issue with Ashwin, especially early in his innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. His dismissal to Ashwin was a straight ball, highlighting his struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   In one innings in Hyderabad, he had 59 false shots but only one dismissal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:47">[02:09:47]</a>.
*   In his subsequent six innings, he had 33 false shots but was dismissed six times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:26">[02:24:26]</a>. This indicates a "normal sort of regression" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:19">[02:22:19]</a>.
*   Many of his mistakes occurred very early in his innings when he wasn't set, leading to dismissals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:55">[02:54:55]</a>. His dismissal by Ashwin's straight ball found him in a "bad position" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:47">[02:35:47]</a>.

### Zak Crawley
Crawley initially played well, despite the ball sometimes keeping low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. He played 91% of his shots on the front foot and 9.9% on the back foot, with his dismissal coming off the back foot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:57">[01:51:57]</a>. He expected the ball to bounce more, leading to what was likely a poor shot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:14">[01:52:14]</a>.

His [[cricketing_roles_and_player_performance_assessment | performance]] against spin has shown significant growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:47">[02:32:47]</a>. While he was previously considered a "terrible player of spin when he sweeps and when he comes down the wicket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:20">[02:36:20]</a>, he now puts pressure on bowlers by staying in the crease and reaching balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. He managed to turn Ashwin's deliveries into "half volleys" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:53">[02:50:53]</a>.

Despite a strong period of batting, his cumulative average remains around 32.46 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:01">[02:31:01]</a>. This is attributed to:
*   Not working through the gears of an innings very well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:58">[02:52:58]</a>.
*   A lack of "cheeky not-outs" or declaration not-outs that boost averages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:57">[02:33:57]</a>.
*   Getting many starts but not converting them into larger scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:17">[02:46:17]</a>.
*   Being given an "enforcement role" due to doubts about his consistent run-scoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:14">[02:27:14]</a>.

Crawley's dismissal showed "really clever bowling from Kuldeep," as he was giving himself room to a ball he shouldn't have been trying to play through cover, and playing off the back foot when he had primarily been playing off the front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:15">[02:49:15]</a>.

### Dhruv Jurel
Jurel was told to play straight as a kid, a technique that proved very handy on this low-bouncing wicket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:42">[01:05:42]</a>. He played very straight, especially when looking for boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:56">[02:57:56]</a>. He made appropriate cricket shots, putting himself in a great position to play them consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:06">[02:56:06]</a>. Jurel appeared "more together" and knowledgeable about his game than his age suggests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:41">[02:59:41]</a>. His strike rate increased throughout his innings, from 50 to 75, through "good, clever cricket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:02">[03:00:02]</a>.

Jurel is considered a strong candidate for a backup role to Rishabh Pant, potentially as both a batter and keeper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:08">[05:43:08]</a>.

### Ben Stokes
Stokes's downfall in both innings was attributed to not coming onto the front foot defensively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:11">[03:16:11]</a>. While his second-innings dismissal was a "ridiculous ball" that spun a long way and kept low, other players might have handled it differently by smothering the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:07">[03:42:07]</a>. His method of playing very late and under his eyes against spinners in Asia has worked for him, but he is considered a "flawed batter" in these conditions, particularly when the ball spins away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:25">[03:34:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:59">[03:38:59]</a>.

### Joe Root
Root's dismissal was debated, with the ball appearing "legs side live" and the review being "optimistic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:52">[03:50:52]</a>. The predictive element of Hawkeye is less reliable on very full balls that hit the pad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:08">[03:55:08]</a>. Root is perceived as looking "stiff when he's bowling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:57">[04:03:57]</a>.

### Ravindra Jadeja
Jadeja is an example of a player who could enter any team as both a pure batter and a pure bowler, though it's noted he is not in India's best six batters without his bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:33">[05:50:33]</a>. This is a rare combination historically, with few players maintaining such versatility over a career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:58">[05:50:58]</a>.

## Overall Team Performance and Strategy

### England
England looked tired and "out of ideas" at points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. After tea, their [[assessing_the_performance_and_style_of_specific_cricket_players | performance]] was described as "bad, horrible, really bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Their opening bowlers delivered a "metric ton of full tosses and half volleys" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Despite their "Bazball" approach, which has been successful on spinning tracks at times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:58">[05:48:58]</a>, they suffered a "really bad collapse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:03">[04:52:03]</a>. Their reliance on the short ball to manufacture wickets, a "Neil Wagner method," is less effective on these pitches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.

### India
India started bowling better in the middle of the day without necessarily hitting cracks, simply by bowling "really, really well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:27">[05:22:27]</a>. There is a clear difference in talent level between the England and Indian spinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:11">[05:36:11]</a>. India's captain, Rohit Sharma, is suggested to have "over-bowled his new ball bowlers" at times, particularly against Crawley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>. India's ability to set up batsmen strategically, as seen with Crawley's dismissal, showcases their tactical intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:30">[02:52:30]</a>.

## Decision Review System (DRS) and Technology
The accuracy of Hawkeye's predictive element for very full balls that hit the pad is questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:28">[04:13:28]</a>. There's a perception that Hawkeye has seemed "more random at times" in the last year or so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:59">[04:09:59]</a>.

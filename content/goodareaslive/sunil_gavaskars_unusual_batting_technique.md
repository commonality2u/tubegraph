[[Sunil Gavaskar]] demonstrated a remarkable and unusual batting technique during a first-class knockout game between Mumbai and Karnataka on a difficult "ranked turner" pitch that was heavily turning on the fifth day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This story is recounted in a book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Batting Against Raghuram Bhat

During the match, Karnataka's renowned left-arm spinner, Raghuram Bhat (who also played one Test match for India), was bowling effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Many of Mumbai's batters were struggling against his spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

Sunil Gavaskar, observing the struggle, reportedly challenged his teammates, stating that they merely needed to "play with the spin" or, if they found it too difficult, he would demonstrate how "actually easy it is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

In an astonishing display of [[sunil_gavaskars_strategic_batting_decisions | strategic batting decisions]], Gavaskar went to the crease and batted left-handed against the left-arm spinner, Raghuram Bhat, surviving for six overs on the turning pitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Dual-Stance Batting

What makes this feat even more extraordinary is that Gavaskar batted left-handed at one end of the pitch and then switched to batting right-handed at the other end, facing an off-spinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This dual-stance approach against different types of spin bowling highlights his exceptional adaptability and skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

Despite Mumbai having already lost the final game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, there was a strong desire to defeat Karnataka outright <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Gavaskar's actions, including moving himself down the batting order and initially putting a left-hander who quickly failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, were part of his strategic efforts, even leading to arguments off the field about his approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

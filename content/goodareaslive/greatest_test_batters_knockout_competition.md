Episode 4 of the "Good Areas Knockout" podcast features a competition to determine the [[greatest_test_batters_of_all_time | greatest test batter]] of all time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. The competition aims to eliminate 63 of the best test batters ever to crown one "G.O.A.T." (Greatest Of All Time) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. The episode is centered around Jared's new book, "The Art of Batting," which is releasing on May 8th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. Shyan Ahmed Khan, a head researcher for the book, and Varun, the game master, also participate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

## Competition Format
The competition involves head-to-head matchups, where participants vote for the batter they believe should advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. Varun, the game master, is responsible for creating the matchups, sometimes leading to "chaotic" first-round eliminations of highly-rated players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">[14:17:00]</a>. The book "The Art of Batting" tells the stories of batters who do "whatever they have to to make runs," from Brian Lara using pot plants for placement to Steve Smith's tennis background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.

## Round 1 Matchups and Results

### Virat Kohli vs Hanif Mohammad
*   **Result:** Virat Kohli advances unanimously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>. Hanif Mohammad is eliminated.
*   **Discussion:**
    *   Many believed Virat Kohli's inclusion would make the book "terrible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>, but his peak performance is highlighted as superior to many other great players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>.
    *   Hanif Mohammad is recognized as a "really, really good player" and the "original little master" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>, known for the longest innings of all time (334 runs, nearly 500 in first-class cricket) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>. However, his record was carefully reviewed for the book, and he wasn't rated in the upper echelon by Jared or Shyan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>.

### David Gower vs Neil Harvey
*   **Result:** Neil Harvey advances unanimously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>. David Gower is eliminated.
*   **Discussion:**
    *   Neil Harvey was an elegant, "lazy" batter, famous in Australian cricket for "moaning about how the Australian team wasn't as good as his team" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>, even against a team considered among the best in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>.
    *   David Gower was considered much higher for the book than most people would expect, nearly making the top 50 based on match factor and advanced stats, despite a lower raw average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>. He had a "ridiculous record" against the West Indies in the West Indies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a> and batted at the "wrong position" for most of his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>.

### Victor Trumper vs Clyde Walcott
*   **Result:** Victor Trumper advances unanimously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:12:00]</a>. Clyde Walcott is eliminated.
*   **Discussion:**
    *   Clyde Walcott's record is described as "a bit more paper thin" when closely examined, despite being a traditionally listed top player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>.
    *   Victor Trumper, the "inventor of attacking cricket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>, is noted for his high strike rate and batting speed that took 80 years for another player to match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:00">[12:15:00]</a>. His average in modern cricket inflation would be around 45-47 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>.

### Sunil Gavaskar vs Ranji (Ranjitsinhji)
*   **Result:** Sunil Gavaskar advances unanimously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>. Ranji is eliminated.
*   **Discussion:**
    *   Ranji played the fewest test matches among players in "The Art of Batting," but his high 50s first-class average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a> and being one of the first to open the leg side with the leg glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:00">[13:51:00]</a> are highlighted. He wasn't picked for every test match due to racial bias in England at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>.

### Garry Sobers vs Herbert Sutcliffe
*   **Result:** Garry Sobers advances unanimously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:09:00">[15:09:00]</a>. Herbert Sutcliffe is eliminated.
*   **Discussion:**
    *   Herbert Sutcliffe, an English opener with an average near 58-59 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:37:00">[14:37:00]</a>, was "done dirty" by being eliminated in the first round against such a strong opponent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:17:00">[15:17:00]</a>. He is compared to Rohit Sharma for being unlucky in matchups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:20:00">[16:20:00]</a>.
    *   Garry Sobers is regarded as among the [[greatest_test_batters_of_all_time | greatest batters of all time]] and potentially the second [[best_test_cricket_allrounders_in_history | greatest cricketer ever]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:47:00">[15:47:00]</a>. His quick strike rate for his era (and overall) is noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:58:00">[15:58:00]</a>.

### Frank Worrell vs Ricky Ponting
*   **Result:** Ricky Ponting advances unanimously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:59:00">[16:59:00]</a>. Frank Worrell is eliminated.
*   **Discussion:**
    *   Frank Worrell is considered "massively underrated" as a batter, with a very even record home and away against all bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:30:00">[18:30:00]</a>. His greatness as a leader often overshadows his batting prowess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:36:00">[18:36:00]</a>. He batted in many different positions, none more than 23 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:52:00">[18:52:00]</a>.
    *   Ricky Ponting's peak is possibly top 10 or even top 5 of all time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:35:00">[17:35:00]</a>. His raw numbers are "insane," and he was one of the [[great_batters_in_cricket_history | greatest players]] of pure fast bowling, especially pull shots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:58:00">[17:58:00]</a>. He was also good against spin in Asia, except in India against Harbhajan Singh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:04:00">[18:04:00]</a>.

### Rahul Dravid vs Don Bradman
*   **Result:** Don Bradman advances unanimously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:50:00">[19:50:00]</a>. Rahul Dravid is eliminated.
*   **Discussion:**
    *   This matchup is seen as "unfair" and "chaotic" due to the early elimination of Rahul Dravid, a "nice guy" with a "strong cricketing brain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:18:00">[19:18:00]</a>.
    *   Rahul Dravid is acknowledged as a [[great_batters_in_cricket_history | great player]] with a brilliant peak and an ability to make runs in many different places, including a late-career renaissance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:17:00">[20:17:00]</a>. He might be the [[top_asian_test_cricket_bowlers_and_batters | best Indian batter]] combined in England and New Zealand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:38:00">[20:38:00]</a> and tormented Pakistan in the early-mid 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:02:00">[21:02:00]</a>.

### Geoff Boycott vs Vijay Hazare
*   **Result:** Geoff Boycott advances unanimously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:56:00">[21:56:00]</a>. Vijay Hazare is eliminated.
*   **Discussion:**
    *   Vijay Hazare is considered a "fantastic player" whose record "holds up really nicely" despite playing only 14-15 test matches (52 innings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:11:00">[22:11:00]</a>. His average of 70 at home versus 36 away from home was a factor for exclusion from the book's top 50 list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:42:00">[22:42:00]</a>. He made 200s in Australia (Adelaide 1948) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:59:00">[22:59:00]</a>.
    *   Geoff Boycott is considered "underrated" as a batter due to his controversial personal character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:20:00">[23:20:00]</a>. Purely on talent, there isn't much difference between him and Hazare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:02:00">[24:02:00]</a>. He was strong against high-end pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:50:00">[23:50:00]</a>.

### Steve Smith vs Wally Hammond
*   **Result:** Steve Smith advances unanimously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:14:00">[28:14:00]</a>. Wally Hammond is eliminated.
*   **Discussion:**
    *   Wally Hammond is noted for dominating New Zealand, averaging over 300 in one series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:24:00">[27:24:00]</a>, which led to him being called a "stat patter" even in his era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:42:00">[25:42:00]</a>. Even removing his New Zealand record, he remains one of the [[greatest_test_batters_of_all_time | greatest batters of all time]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:58:00">[25:58:00]</a>. He was a hard-hitting player for his time, akin to Clive Lloyd or Matthew Hayden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:10:00">[26:10:00]</a>. He averaged 46 in the fourth innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:58:00">[26:58:00]</a>.

### Mahela Jayawardene vs Usman Khawaja
*   **Result:** Mahela Jayawardene advances unanimously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:35:00">[29:35:00]</a>. Usman Khawaja is eliminated.
*   **Discussion:**
    *   Usman Khawaja's numbers look good partly because he wasn't consistently in the side during his less productive 20s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:48:00">[30:48:00]</a>. He's considered a little short of the top level of players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:19:00">[30:19:00]</a>.
    *   Mahela Jayawardene had to play Test cricket for Sri Lanka regardless of form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:31:00">[30:31:00]</a>. He has over 9,000 runs just in Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:05:00">[31:05:00]</a>.

### Gundappa Viswanath vs Clive Lloyd
*   **Result:** Clive Lloyd advances unanimously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:01:00">[33:01:00]</a>. Gundappa Viswanath is eliminated.
*   **Discussion:**
    *   Clive Lloyd used a very heavy bat (3 pound, 34 oz), significantly heavier than modern bats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:15:00">[33:15:00]</a>.
    *   Gundappa Viswanath is described as a "great player" who averaged almost 50 at home but in the 30s away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:27:00">[34:27:00]</a>. He never lost a game where he made a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:53:00">[34:53:00]</a>. However, he struggled against strong bowling attacks in New Zealand, Pakistan, and the West Indies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:30:00">[35:30:00]</a>.

### Andy Flower vs Ken Barrington
*   **Result:** Ken Barrington advances with a split vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:35:00">[36:35:00]</a>. Andy Flower is eliminated.
*   **Discussion:**
    *   Andy Flower was "incredible against India" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:55:00">[36:55:00]</a>. His median entry point was 62 for three, meaning he consistently came in during collapses and still averaged over 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:29:00">[37:29:00]</a>. He also averaged 50 for Essex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:18:00">[38:18:00]</a> and was a very effective wicket-keeper batter for Zimbabwe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:12:00">[38:12:00]</a>. He is remembered for his big sweep and reverse sweep shots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:59:00">[37:59:00]</a>. His prime may have been cut short due to the black arm protest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:33:00">[38:33:00]</a>.

### Gordon Greenidge vs Javed Miandad
*   **Result:** Javed Miandad advances unanimously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:53:00">[39:53:00]</a>. Gordon Greenidge is eliminated.
*   **Discussion:**
    *   Both players played "a bit too long," which affected their numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:05:00">[40:05:00]</a>.
    *   Gordon Greenidge is highlighted as one of the few attacking openers without a hole in his career against the lateral ball, making runs in New Zealand and England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:17:00">[40:17:00]</a>. He's described as a "perfect combination of English technique and West Indian thinking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:44:00">[40:44:00]</a>, capable of both solid technique and powerful hitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:00:00">[41:00:00]</a>. His Lord's innings is noted as "ridiculous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:28:00">[41:28:00]</a>.

### WG Grace vs Bob Simpson
*   **Result:** WG Grace advances unanimously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:00:00">[42:00:00]</a>. Bob Simpson is eliminated.
*   **Discussion:**
    *   Bob Simpson's metrics initially ranked him "really high" based on ratios for the book, but further analysis led to his exclusion from the top 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:16:00">[42:16:00]</a>. He retired for 10 years due to financial reasons, then returned for the Packer series when Australian players left, playing against India and the West Indies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:25:00">[43:25:00]</a>. He averaged 47 overall, but over 50 as an opener <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:24:00">[44:24:00]</a>.

### Younis Khan vs Mike Hussey
*   **Result:** Younis Khan advances unanimously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:15:00">[45:15:00]</a>. Mike Hussey is eliminated.
*   **Discussion:**
    *   Mike Hussey is in "The Art of Batting" book but not on its top 50 list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:34:00">[45:34:00]</a>. The difficulty in comparing him to Younis Khan arises because Hussey started his Test career later in his peak, while Younis Khan played from his early 20s until his late career, enduring years of developing his game at the Test level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:29:00">[46:29:00]</a>.
    *   Younis Khan is considered "way better than people think he is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:37:00">[47:37:00]</a>. He is Pakistan's only batter with 10,000 Test runs and has a century in every country he's played in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:47:00">[47:47:00]</a>. He also has a Test triple century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:18:00">[48:18:00]</a>.

### Martin Crowe vs Steve Waugh
*   **Result:** Steve Waugh advances unanimously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:52:00">[49:52:00]</a>. Martin Crowe is eliminated.
*   **Discussion:**
    *   Steve Waugh started his career very young and was initially picked for his bowling, not being a Test-level batter for a while <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:23:00">[50:23:00]</a>. He averaged 30.5 after 26 Tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:26:00">[51:26:00]</a>.
    *   Martin Crowe is considered an "important player in the history of cricket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:41:00">[50:41:00]</a>. His career was hampered by knee injuries and his body "falling apart," preventing him from having a stronger late-career average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:49:00">[50:49:00]</a>. He had a period of five or six years averaging 60 in Test cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:28:00">[52:28:00]</a>. Wasim Akram named him as the toughest batter to bowl to, noting his ability to counter reverse swing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:41:00">[51:41:00]</a>.

### Inzamam-ul-Haq vs Jack Hobbs
*   **Result:** Jack Hobbs advances unanimously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:12:00">[53:12:00]</a>. Inzamam-ul-Haq is eliminated.
*   **Discussion:**
    *   Inzamam-ul-Haq is one of Pakistan's most important players, but not their best Test batter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:53:00">[53:53:00]</a>. He would have averaged 50 in Test cricket if not for his World XI Test match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:00:00">[54:00:00]</a>. He's considered an "automatic great" for the top 50 list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:36:00">[54:36:00]</a>.
    *   Jack Hobbs averaged over 50 as an opener and scored 197 or 199 first-class hundreds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:43:00">[54:43:00]</a>, in an era where averaging 35 was considered very good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:48:00">[54:48:00]</a>.

### Greg Chappell vs Graeme Smith
*   **Result:** Greg Chappell advances with a split vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:31:00">[55:31:00]</a>. Graeme Smith is eliminated.
*   **Discussion:**
    *   Greg Chappell is an "undoubtedly a great batter" who missed about 10 Test matches due to World Series Cricket, where he averaged around 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:54:00">[55:54:00]</a>.
    *   Graeme Smith was remembered more as a captain than a batter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:01:00">[56:01:00]</a>, despite being "fantastic." He averaged 41.2 at home, contrasting with his 48 overall average, meaning he performed much better away from home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:23:00">[56:23:00]</a>. He is considered an "automatic great" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:52:00">[56:52:00]</a> and made a double century against England early in his career after being dropped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:08:00">[57:08:00]</a>.

### Allan Border vs Virender Sehwag
*   **Result:** Allan Border advances unanimously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:43:00">[57:43:00]</a>. Virender Sehwag is eliminated.
*   **Discussion:**
    *   Allan Border averaged over 50 both away and at home, a rare feat in cricket history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:13:00">[58:13:00]</a>. He did this in a low-scoring era (the 1980s) for a "rubbish" Australian team that he helped turn around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:33:00">[58:33:00]</a>, often carrying the batting lineup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:05:00">[59:05:00]</a>.
    *   Virender Sehwag struggled with the laterally moving ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.

### Len Hutton vs Dean Jones
*   **Result:** Len Hutton advances unanimously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:23:00">[01:00:23:00]</a>. Dean Jones is eliminated.
*   **Discussion:**
    *   Dean Jones made two double centuries, one against the "proper West Indies" and another in India where he nearly died <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:44:00">[01:00:44:00]</a>. He didn't play much Test cricket due to Australia's strong middle order (Steve Waugh, Allan Border, Mark Waugh) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:50:00">[01:00:50:00]</a>. He was likely better in his 30s than his 20s, so his full potential in Tests was never seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:24:00">[01:01:24:00]</a>. He was a "fantastic test player" whose personality sometimes "rubbed people up the wrong way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03:00">[01:03:03:00]</a>, akin to Kevin Pietersen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:55:00">[01:01:55:00]</a>.

### Justin Langer vs Michael Clarke
*   **Result:** Michael Clarke advances with a split vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:55:00">[01:03:55:00]</a>. Justin Langer is eliminated.
*   **Discussion:**
    *   Both players' numbers are inflated due to playing in a "great batting era" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:55:00">[01:04:55:00]</a>. Neither made the top 50 in the book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01:00">[01:05:01:00]</a>.
    *   Justin Langer had an "amazing career" as an opener, especially in his later years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:50:00">[01:04:50:00]</a>. His job at the top of the order is considered harder than a number five in a great batting era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:12:00">[01:05:12:00]</a>. He is compared to Usman Khawaja, with little difference between them as openers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:08:00">[01:06:08:00]</a>.
    *   Michael Clarke's end-of-career performance, before his back issues, was "miraculous" and the player he always should have been based purely on talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:42:00">[01:05:42:00]</a>.

### Kevin Pietersen vs George Headley
*   **Result:** George Headley advances unanimously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:06:00">[01:07:06:00]</a>. Kevin Pietersen is eliminated.
*   **Discussion:**
    *   Kevin Pietersen is considered one of the most controversial top 50 batters picked for the book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:34:00">[01:07:34:00]</a>. His ability to change a game is almost "unparalleled," an "S tier" ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:46:00">[01:07:46:00]</a>. He had a "butchering" style of play and would dominate bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:12:00">[01:08:12:00]</a>. He has multiple "best knocks" in the last 15 years, including 149 against Dale Steyn in Lords and a great innings in Colombo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:25:00">[01:09:25:00]</a>. He is seen as a better batter than VVS Laxman in terms of game-changing impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:53:00">[01:09:53:00]</a>.
    *   George Headley is known as "The Black Bradman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:31:00">[01:10:31:00]</a>.

### VVS Laxman vs Graeme Hick
*   **Result:** VVS Laxman advances unanimously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:12:00">[01:11:12:00]</a>. Graeme Hick is eliminated.
*   **Discussion:**
    *   Neither player is featured in "The Art of Batting" book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:18:00">[01:11:18:00]</a>.
    *   Graeme Hick was one of England's better batters during their "woeful period" in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:25:00">[01:11:25:00]</a>.
    *   VVS Laxman could "change an entire test match" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:42:00">[01:11:42:00]</a>, although his overall record might be "overrated" due to iconic innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00:00">[01:12:00:00]</a>.

### Mohammad Yousuf vs Viv Richards
*   **Result:** Viv Richards advances unanimously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:13:00">[01:14:13:00]</a>. Mohammad Yousuf is eliminated.
*   **Discussion:**
    *   Mohammad Yousuf "just made it in" to the book's list, with some internal struggle during the research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:37:00">[01:12:37:00]</a>. If his standout year were removed, he might not be in the conversation for [[greatest_test_batters_of_all_time | greatest batters]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:52:00">[01:12:52:00]</a>. He broke Viv Richards' record for most runs and centuries in a calendar year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:11:00">[01:14:11:00]</a>.
    *   Viv Richards is a clear choice to advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:13:00">[01:14:13:00]</a>.

### Sachin Tendulkar vs Rohan Kanhai
*   **Result:** Sachin Tendulkar advances unanimously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:28:00">[01:15:28:00]</a>. Rohan Kanhai is eliminated.
*   **Discussion:**
    *   Rohan Kanhai is highly rated, with Sunil Gavaskar also holding him in high regard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:51:00">[01:14:51:00]</a>. He is considered a "forgotten great" who didn't get the credit he deserved despite others in his batting order making many runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:09:00">[01:15:09:00]</a>.

### Saiyid Anwar vs Kumar Sangakkara
*   **Result:** Kumar Sangakkara advances unanimously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:12:00">[01:16:12:00]</a>. Saiyid Anwar is eliminated.
*   **Discussion:**
    *   Kumar Sangakkara has the highest batting average (57.4) among players in the 10,000-run club, which would have been higher if not for his last series where Ashwin kept getting him out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:26:00">[01:16:26:00]</a>.
    *   Saiyid Anwar wasn't picked for about two years when he should have been playing Test cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:01:00">[01:17:01:00]</a>. Pakistan missed out on about six years of his prime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:07:00">[01:17:07:00]</a>. He is considered a better Test player than ODI player, despite being an [[greatest_odi_batters_of_all_time | ODI great]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:50:00">[01:17:50:00]</a>. He has a "weird record" with many centuries away from home in winning causes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:02:00">[01:18:02:00]</a>.

### Brian Lara vs Zaheer Abbas
*   **Result:** Brian Lara advances unanimously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:41:00">[01:18:41:00]</a>. Zaheer Abbas is eliminated.
*   **Discussion:**
    *   Brian Lara is recognized as one of the [[greatest_test_batters_of_all_time | greatest test batters of all time]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:47:00">[01:18:47:00]</a>.
    *   Zaheer Abbas was called the "Asian Bradman" but his numbers show only a couple of brilliant years without sustained peak performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:58:00">[01:18:58:00]</a>. His [[greatest_odi_batters_of_all_time | ODI record]] is "ridiculous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:14:00">[01:19:14:00]</a>, and he benefited from televised games, providing more highlights than earlier Asian players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:27:00">[01:19:27:00]</a>. He has over 100 first-class hundreds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:58:00">[01:19:58:00]</a>.

### Joe Root vs Hashim Amla
*   **Result:** Joe Root advances unanimously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:29:00">[01:20:29:00]</a>. Hashim Amla is eliminated.
*   **Discussion:**
    *   Hashim Amla is considered a "fantastic" player, possibly just below the automatic top 50, with a strong record, especially in Australia and India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:22:00">[01:21:22:00]</a>. However, he wasn't as impressive at home compared to his away record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:27:00">[01:21:27:00]</a>. He is considered a "peak player" whose performance on either side of his peak was not as impressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:10:00">[01:21:10:00]</a>. He is also described as an [[greatest_odi_batters_of_all_time | underrated ODI batter]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:48:00">[01:21:48:00]</a>.
    *   Joe Root is considered "miles ahead" of Amla and his career is still ongoing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:03:00">[01:21:03:00]</a>.

### AB de Villiers vs Everton Weekes
*   **Result:** AB de Villiers advances unanimously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:06:00">[01:22:06:00]</a>. Everton Weekes is eliminated.
*   **Discussion:**
    *   All the "W's" (Worrell, Walcott, Weekes) are now gone from the competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:14:00">[01:22:14:00]</a>.
    *   Everton Weekes is considered a "fantastic" batter, but his numbers may look better due to a lot of runs made in a few key matchups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:42:00">[01:22:42:00]</a>.
    *   AB de Villiers is seen as a "different level" of player, with "all the gears" and versatility to participate in a "blockathon" or take bowlers apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:29:00">[01:22:29:00]</a>.

### Kane Williamson vs Alastair Cook
*   **Result:** Alastair Cook advances with a split vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:17:00">[01:23:17:00]</a>. Kane Williamson is eliminated.
*   **Discussion:**
    *   Kane Williamson has a "flaw in his record" for struggling against the very best teams (South Africa, England, Australia, India) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:26:00">[01:24:26:00]</a>. He is considered "a bit unlucky" because New Zealand plays fewer Tests and he is often injured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:09:00">[01:25:09:00]</a>.
    *   Alastair Cook's performances in Australia (2010-11) and India are highlighted, where he "put a whole series on lockdown" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:48:00">[01:24:48:00]</a>.

### Graeme Pollock vs Matthew Hayden
*   **Result:** Matthew Hayden advances unanimously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:57:00">[01:25:57:00]</a>. Graeme Pollock is eliminated.
*   **Discussion:**
    *   Both players are positioned next to each other in "The Art of Batting" book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:09:00">[01:26:09:00]</a>.
    *   Graeme Pollock is considered potentially a more talented player by those who saw him play, but Matthew Hayden had the "better career" due to playing significantly more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:33:00">[01:26:33:00]</a>. His series in India greatly elevated his numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:42:00">[01:26:42:00]</a>. He is a "quick-scoring batter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:37:00">[01:26:37:00]</a>. Hayden's strike rate (around 60) is not considered as "transformative" as players like Kevin Pietersen or Gordon Greenidge, but when he "put the foot down, it changed the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:32:00">[01:27:32:00]</a>. In one match, he outscored Pakistan's combined two innings total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:01:00">[01:28:01:00]</a>.

### Shivnarine Chanderpaul vs Jacques Kallis
*   **Result:** Jacques Kallis advances unanimously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:45:00">[01:28:45:00]</a>. Shivnarine Chanderpaul is eliminated.
*   **Discussion:**
    *   It's an "unfortunate" and "really tough draw" for Chanderpaul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:50:00">[01:28:50:00]</a>.
    *   Shivnarine Chanderpaul didn't average much when batting with Brian Lara, meaning their greatness didn't overlap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:17:00">[01:29:17:00]</a>. By the end of his career, he was "less likely to be dismissed if he doesn't want to be dismissed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:26:00">[01:29:26:00]</a>. His unusual batting stance is highlighted as remarkable for a player among the [[greatest_test_batters_of_all_time | top 50 test batters of all time]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:42:00">[01:29:42:00]</a>.

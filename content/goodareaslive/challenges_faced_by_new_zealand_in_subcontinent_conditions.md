New Zealand faces significant [[challenges_of_winning_a_test_series_in_india | challenges in winning a Test series in India]], particularly given the strong home advantage India holds. Historically, New Zealand's chances of even securing a single Test win in India are considered extremely low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>.

## Overall Series Outlook

Ahead of an upcoming three-match Test series in India, the odds are heavily stacked against New Zealand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:23">[01:53:23]</a>. Experts predict a 3-0 victory for India, with the host nation only needing a couple of days to win a Test match, even with rain delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. India has not lost a home Test series since England in 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:29">[09:38:29]</a>.

A key factor is the perceived strength of the current Indian team compared to New Zealand's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:14">[02:14:14]</a>. The New Zealand team that toured India two to three years prior was considered stronger than the current squad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:48">[02:10:48]</a>.

## Batting Challenges

Several key New Zealand batters have experienced recent drops in form over the last 18 months, including Tim Southee, Devon Conway, Tom Blundell, and Daryl Mitchell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:10">[03:35:10]</a>.

A significant blow to New Zealand's batting lineup is the absence of key players. Kane Williamson, who averages 33.5 in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:39">[13:51:39]</a>, is not playing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:47">[03:48:47]</a> and will miss the first Test due to a groin injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:13:55">[31:13:55]</a>. His absence means that the batting responsibility heavily falls on players like Daryl Mitchell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:11:00">[30:11:00]</a>. While Glenn Phillips might offer some utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:18:49">[30:18:49]</a>, the team's ability to "cobble together something" to win a Test match depends on multiple players being in form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:15:00">[31:15:00]</a>.

The prevalence of left-handed batters in the New Zealand squad also presents a problem given the expected "ragging" surfaces in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:20">[14:15:20]</a>. Left-handers mentioned include Tom Latham, Devon Conway, Rachin Ravindra, Michael Bracewell, Mitchell Santner, and Mark Chapman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59:40">[13:59:40]</a>.

## Bowling Concerns

New Zealand's spin bowling options are a significant disadvantage when compared to India's formidable lineup, which includes Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, and Kuldeep Yadav <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:09:00">[11:09:00]</a>. Ajaz Patel, despite being a "really good player in these conditions" and a potentially strong spin option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>, would likely be India's sixth or eighth best spinner due to their abundant choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:53">[03:20:53]</a>. He is expected to take a large bulk of New Zealand's overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:59:45">[12:59:45]</a>.

Other spin options for New Zealand are limited:
*   Mitchell Santner was not impressive against Sri Lanka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:40">[10:34:40]</a>.
*   Michael Bracewell, while offering extra batting and having a good "best ball," is not consistently a frontline bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>.
*   Rachin Ravindra's bowling might suit Indian conditions, but is generally considered a part-time option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:00]</a>.
*   Glenn Phillips and Kane Williamson can offer part-time spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:17">[10:46:17]</a>.

The team's seam bowling options also pose a challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>. Matt Henry is not suited to the conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:27">[05:46:27]</a>. Tim Southee's form has dropped off significantly, especially during his captaincy, where he took 35 wickets at an average of 39 in 14 Test matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>. New Zealand had Kyle Jamieson and a "much more informed" Tim Southee on their last tour, but they didn't impact games as hoped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>.

Young seamer William O'Rourke is a promising talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>, who showed good bounce in Sri Lanka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a> and is considered a "flat pitch bowler" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. He has taken 19 wickets in four Tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:45:00">[31:45:00]</a>, with nine of those coming against [[challenges_faced_by_south_africa_cricket_team | South Africa's D team]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:53:00">[31:53:00]</a>, but his form in Sri Lanka was impressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:00:00">[32:00:00]</a>. However, he is still a new player on the scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>.

## Leadership and Conditions

The recent captaincy change, with Tom Latham replacing Tim Southee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>, is not expected to have a "huge" impact on the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>. Latham has often served as a makeshift captain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a> and is considered a "Vice Captain" rather than a full-time leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>. Southee's resignation might have been due to his realization that his form would not make him an automatic pick for the India Tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>.

India is likely to prepare pitches that turn significantly, especially on days four and five, to leverage their home advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:20">[14:15:20]</a>. While India might aim for three-and-a-half to four-day Test matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:19:00">[15:19:00]</a>, their spin bowling depth means even on "flat pitches" their spinners can outperform visiting teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:17:00">[21:17:00]</a>.

To win a Test match, New Zealand would need an extraordinary performance: early wickets from their bowlers, a significant first-innings lead from their batters, and all their key players (especially Kane Williamson and Daryl Mitchell) to be in form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:04:00">[30:04:00]</a>. Even if New Zealand were at their "maximum" across all aspects, India would still be a 50-60% chance of winning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:38:00">[32:38:00]</a>.

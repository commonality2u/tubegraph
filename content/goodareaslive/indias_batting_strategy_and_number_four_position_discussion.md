India's performance in the 2023 Cricket World Cup has been dominant, with the team remaining undefeated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. This success has brought discussions about the team's batting strategy, particularly regarding the much-debated number four position.

## The Evolving Number Four Position
Prior to the World Cup, India's number four position was considered a "massive issue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. This concern stemmed partly from the 2019 World Cup, where India's number fours averaged remarkably low, just under 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. However, in the 2023 World Cup, the average for the number four position has significantly improved to almost 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

This improvement has been attributed to a combination of factors, including player rotation, minor injuries, and "random dumb luck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. Players like Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul have performed exceptionally well in these middle-order roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>. When the top three batters perform well, it generally eases the pressure on the number four, allowing them to perform better due to a "strike rate buffer or... runs on the board buffer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.

While Shreyas Iyer had a slow start to the tournament, he later became "absolutely ballistic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>. KL Rahul's role as a number five batsman is described as a "hinge point" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>, providing extra batting when needed and occasionally needing to attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>. Ideally, the top three or four batsmen should handle the majority of the scoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.

[!INFO] The "number four problem" was largely "overblown" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>. India had players like Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul capable of performing the role well, with even Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli being potential options if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>. The narrative was partly a "hangover from the last World Cup" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:52:00">[49:52:00]</a>.

## Virat Kohli's Batting Against Spin
A notable discussion point regarding [[indias_batting_lineup_and_talent_pool | India's batting lineup]] is Virat Kohli's technique when playing spin, particularly left-arm finger spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>. It's suggested that when [[indias_performance_and_strategies_in_test_cricket | India started making their pitches more helpful for Spinners in Test matches]], Kohli had to adjust his technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>.

This change is believed to have negatively impacted his performance against left-arm finger spin across all three formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:34]</a>. Historically, Kohli was "close to the best right-hander in the world" against left-arm finger spin up until the start of 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a>, even performing better than against off-spin, which is a rare anomaly for a right-handed batsman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>. However, since 2020, there has been a dramatic drop in his average against left-arm finger spin, while his performance against off-spin has remained stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>.

The technical change is likely a cascading effect of adjustments made for [[indias_performance_and_strategies_in_recent_test_matches | Test matches]] that inadvertently affected his white-ball game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:27:00">[15:27:00]</a>. This highlights how top-level professionals must constantly mitigate their flaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:58:00">[50:58:00]</a>.

## Overall Team Strengths
India's overall strength in this World Cup stems from their lack of "obvious flaws" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:46:00">[38:46:00]</a>. While concerns exist about the bowling depth without Hardik Pandya, forcing reliance on part-time bowlers like Virat Kohli or Shubman Gill in case of injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:51:00">[40:51:00]</a>, this is considered a common risk in World Cups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:15:00">[41:15:00]</a>. The team's strong top-order batting minimizes the pressure on the lower order, making the absence of a strong number eight batsman less critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:01:00">[42:01:00]</a>.

The comprehensive nature of India's squad, with players consistently in form across batting and bowling, differentiates them from other strong teams that often have more pronounced weaknesses or players out of form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:13:00">[40:13:00]</a>.

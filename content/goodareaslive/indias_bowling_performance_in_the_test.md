[[Indias bowling strategies and performance | India's bowling strategies and performance]] in the recent Test match have shown resilience and effectiveness, particularly in handling England's aggressive "Bazball" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. Despite Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja not bowling extensively, the support bowlers, Kuldeep Yadav and Mohammed Siraj, stepped up significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Key Bowler Performances

*   **Mohammed Siraj:** After a high economy rate of 5.4 on Day 2, Siraj impressively reduced it to 2.7 on Day 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. He was particularly effective in "crushing the tail," a strength [[Indias bowling strategies and performance | India]] has demonstrated consistently in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Siraj bowled a good ball to dismiss Ben Foakes and a Yorker to Rehan Ahmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. He aims to bowl more Yorkers, which are considered highly effective against the tail, though a knee-roll length might be preferred when the ball is just slightly reversing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.
*   **Kuldeep Yadav:** Kuldeep "held his own" against England's targeted aggression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. He bowled well, delivering many great balls, even if some wickets came from less-than-perfect deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **Jasprit Bumrah:** Bumrah was the primary bowler entrusted with long spells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. His unique wide-angled delivery proved difficult for batsmen, particularly Joe Root, who was cramped by the inward angle when attempting a reverse scoop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. This specific angle makes it a very tough shot to execute against him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. Bumrah often troubles Root in India, possibly due to this angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:46">[01:02:46]</a>.
*   **Ravindra Jadeja:** Jadeja bowled only four overs for 33 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. He had entered the Test match injured and was said to be only 90% fit, which likely limited his bowling, with cramping issues also reported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:40">[01:01:40]</a>.

## Strategic Approach

[[Indias aggressive Test cricket strategies | India's bowling strategy]] involved utilizing four bowlers who could provide rest to each other and be deployed when conditions were most favorable, putting England on the defensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>. This approach countered England's tactic of targeting the fourth and fifth bowlers to overwork the main ones like Bumrah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. If these "support" bowlers take wickets, it significantly undermines England's strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. All of [[Indias bowling strategies and performance | India's bowlers]] maintained economy rates around three, highlighting their control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>.

## Wicketkeeping Observations

Dhruv Jurel, the wicketkeeper, struggled at times to pick Kuldeep Yadav's wrong'uns, indicating a lack of extensive experience keeping to him, despite being Ranji Trophy teammates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>. His hands were occasionally out of position for deliveries that went over the stumps, suggesting he was expecting different spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>. This challenge is expected to increase as the pitch deteriorates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:47">[00:27:47]</a>.

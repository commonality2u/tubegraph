The Crick Picks podcast, in its 50th episode, undertook the challenging task of drafting the "best cricketers of all time" across all formats, emphasizing the chaos and subjectivity inherent in such a broad category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:21">[01:18:21]</a>. The discussion highlighted the multifaceted roles and impacts of legendary players, extending beyond mere statistics to include their cultural significance and influence on the game.

## Don Bradman
[[great_batters_in_cricket_history | Don Bradman]] was the first pick in the draft, largely considered an easy choice due to his unparalleled record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:28">[01:30:28]</a>. His career was likely impacted by World War II, as he missed some of his peak years, suggesting his record could have been even better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. While he averaged around 20 on sticky surfaces, his average soared to 60 on good pitches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. He is seen as the first player equipped to dominate modern, true wickets, setting him apart from contemporaries who still struggled on sticky or seamy pitches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. Beyond his statistical dominance, Bradman is held in such high regard in Australia that his image is legally protected, akin to a saint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>.

## Shane Warne
Shane Warne was the second pick, selected for his immense impact as a leg-spinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>. He took 708 Test wickets and 293 ODI wickets, was an ODI World Cup winner with Australia, and also won the inaugural IPL season, demonstrating his success across formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. Warne was noted for his brilliant cricketing brain and even his respectable batting, despite never reaching a Test century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. He is credited with making leg spin "sexy again" after Abdul Qadir kept it alive in the 80s, showcasing effortless action and a wide variety of deliveries, including the flipper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. His dominance was so profound that even years after his playing career, Wisden included him in their top five players of the decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>.

## Other Influential Historic Cricketers
The discussion expanded to include other legendary players who left an indelible mark on cricket:

*   **Sir Garfield Sobers**
    [[historical_cricketers_with_overlooked_achievements | Sir Garfield Sobers]] was praised as a versatile all-rounder who could bowl incredibly well and was a great batter, excelling in a challenging era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>. He is an iconic figure, having had a huge impact both during and after his playing career, even influencing cricketers in Sri Lanka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>. Sobers was a pioneer, being the first person to hit six sixes in an over and holding the record for the highest Test score (365) before Lara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>.

*   **Muttiah Muralitharan**
    [[discussion_of_famous_odi_bowlers | Muttiah Muralitharan]] boasts an extraordinary 800 Test wickets and is a World Cup winner with Sri Lanka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>. His greatness is amplified by the fact that Sri Lanka's team was heavily reliant on him, unlike other teams with multiple strong bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>. Muralitharan came from a developing cricketing nation with a less established system, often playing limited overseas Tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>. His mental strength to overcome controversies, like the "chucking" allegations, and continue to perform at an elite level, coupled with his background as an ethnic minority in Sri Lanka, make his story particularly impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>. He was described as a "freak of nature" who generated shockwaves not just through his bowling but also his unique action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>.

*   **Imran Khan**
    Imran Khan was highlighted for his outstanding all-round record, averaging below 20 with the ball and over 50 with the bat in Test matches between 1981 and 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>. His overall Test career includes 3,887 runs and 362 wickets at an average of 22.81 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>. As a World Cup winning captain for Pakistan, he profoundly changed the persona of Pakistan cricket, instilling a "rock and roll" attitude of fast bowling and winning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:00">[11:35:00]</a>. He is also considered an underrated ODI player, with an average of 33.41 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00">[12:06:00]</a>.

*   **Sachin Tendulkar**
    [[great_batters_in_cricket_history | Sachin Tendulkar]] is recognized as one of the [[great_batters_in_cricket_history | greatest ODI players]] and Test players of all time, with a strong case for being the greatest batter ever, perhaps only surpassed by Bradman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>. His cultural impact on India is significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:00">[13:42:00]</a>. Tendulkar's incredible longevity saw him play 463 ODIs and 200 Test matches, scoring over 34,000 international runs and a record 100 centuries over a career spanning 24 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:43:00">[16:43:00]</a>.

*   **Viv Richards**
    [[great_batters_in_cricket_history | Viv Richards]] is arguably the [[great_batters_in_cricket_history | greatest ODI batter]] of all time and solidly ranks within the top 10 Test batters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:18:00">[15:18:00]</a>. His batting style was revolutionary, with unparalleled speed in Test cricket, and he is still considered among the top strike rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:32:00">[15:32:00]</a>. Richards is described as a "time traveler," far ahead of his time, who completely revolutionized the sport with his flamboyant and aggressive play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:35:00">[16:35:00]</a>.

*   **AB de Villiers**
    [[ab_de_villiers_discussing_cricketing_legends_and_their_strengths | AB de Villiers]] was a "pioneer" of 360-degree cricket, capable of scoring in all directions and excelling in various batting positions across formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:43:00">[17:43:00]</a>. He was versatile, able to play blockathons in Tests or aggressively bat the opposition out of the game, and even performed wicketkeeping and occasional bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:53:00">[17:53:00]</a>. His ODI record includes 9,577 runs at an average of 53.5 with a strike rate over 100, and in Tests, he scored 8,765 runs with 22 centuries at an average of 50.66 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:14:00">[18:14:00]</a>.

*   **Brian Lara**
    Brian Lara is considered the batting equivalent of Shane Warne and Muttiah Muralitharan in his era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:29:00">[20:29:00]</a>. Many left-handers who followed him emulated his style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:41:00">[20:41:00]</a>. Lara's brilliance was best appreciated by watching him in full flow, known for his flamboyance, high backlift, and ability to "murder" both pace and spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:39:00">[21:39:00]</a>. He achieved unique records, being the first man to register scores of 375, 400*, and 501 in first-class cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:32:00">[22:32:00]</a>.

*   **Wasim Akram**
    [[discussion_of_famous_odi_bowlers | Wasim Akram]] is regarded as a great fast bowler, excelling with both new and old balls and mastering reverse swing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:02:00">[23:02:00]</a>. He was also a handy batter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:17:00">[23:17:00]</a>. Akram took 916 wickets across formats (414 Tests, 502 ODIs) and was the record holder for most ODI wickets until Muralitharan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:44:00">[23:44:00]</a>. His ability to evolve, even shortening his run-up and changing his action while maintaining effectiveness, cemented his relevance throughout his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:07:00">[24:07:00]</a>.

*   **Jacques Kallis**
    Jacques Kallis is considered a strong contender for the third-best all-rounder of all time, after Sobers and Imran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:45:00">[26:45:00]</a>. In Test cricket, he averaged 55.37 across 166 games, scoring 13,289 runs, and in ODIs, he amassed 11,579 runs at over 44 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:55:00">[26:55:00]</a>. He also contributed significantly with the ball, taking 292 Test wickets and 273 ODI wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:20:00">[27:20:00]</a>.

*   **W.G. Grace**
    W.G. Grace is a pioneering figure in cricket history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:52:00">[29:52:00]</a>. His first-class record, especially before Test cricket became formalized, is exceptional, with years where he scored more centuries than the rest of first-class cricket combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:52:00">[30:52:00]</a>. Despite playing Test cricket while in his mid-to-late 30s and not taking it "seriously" due to his medical practice, he remained superior to his contemporaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:29:00">[30:29:00]</a>. In First-Class Cricket, where he dominated, he averaged 65 in 1868 when others averaged around 15, and continued to average highly over subsequent years (e.g., 57, 54, 78) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:37:00">[31:37:00]</a>. As a bowler, he took 289 first-class wickets at an average of 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:11:00">[32:11:00]</a>.

*   **Glenn McGrath**
    Glenn McGrath is recognized as one of the top 15 cricketers of all time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:18:00">[35:18:00]</a>.

A three-time ODI World Cup winner, he was known for his exceptional accuracy and ability to evolve as a bowler even as he lost pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:32:00">[35:32:00]</a>. He was so accurate that he could reportedly hit a coin on the pitch with every delivery, masterfully working over batters with his setups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:01:00">[37:01:00]</a>.

*   **Kumar Sangakkara**
    Kumar Sangakkara was a controversial last pick, but is recognized as a great Test batter and has the second-most overall runs in international cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:37:00">[39:37:00]</a>.

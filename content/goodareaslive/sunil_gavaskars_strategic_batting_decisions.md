[[historical_cricket_matches_featuring_sunil_gavaskar | Sunil Gavaskar]] once demonstrated a unique and remarkable batting strategy during a first-class knockout game between Mumbai and Karnataka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The match was played on a "ranked turner" pitch, which was significantly turning by the fourth or fifth day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Remarkable Display Against Spin

During the game, Karnataka's renowned left-arm spinner, Raghuram Bhat, who had also played one Test match for India, was causing significant trouble for the batters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Many batters were struggling to cope with his bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

According to the story, [[historical_cricket_matches_featuring_sunil_gavaskar | Sunil Gavaskar]] challenged his teammates:
> "Man you just have to play with the spin or you know if you think it's too hard I'll show you how actually easy it is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

To prove his point and demonstrate effective [[strategic_insights_on_test_cricket_batting | strategic batting]], Gavaskar decided to bat in an extraordinary manner:
*   He moved himself down the batting order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
*   He initially sent in a left-handed batter, who did not last long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   Gavaskar then proceeded to bat left-handed against Raghuram Bhat for six overs on the turning pitch and successfully survived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   Even more remarkably, at the other end of the pitch, he batted right-handed against an off-spinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This unique approach showcased his adaptability and [[sunil_gavaskars_unusual_batting_technique | unusual batting technique]] against different types of spin bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

Although Mumbai had already lost the game, which was a final, Karnataka sought an outright win against them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This incident highlights Gavaskar's leadership and his unconventional approach to [[strategy_and_decisionmaking_in_cricket | strategy and decision-making in cricket]], even in challenging match situations.

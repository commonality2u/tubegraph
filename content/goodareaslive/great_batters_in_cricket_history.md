Former Sri Lankan international cricketer Kumar Sangakkara, currently the Director of Cricket and Head Coach of Rajasthan Royals in the IPL, offers insights into what makes a great batter, drawing from his own career and observations of legendary players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Kumar Sangakkara's Batting Philosophy

Sangakkara describes himself as more "workmanlike" rather than a "special talent" like players such as [[historical_criketers_with_overlooked_achievements | Aravinda de Silva]], [[historical_criketers_with_overlooked_achievements | Sanath Jayasuriya]], or TM Dilshan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. His father, his primary coach, emphasized technical excellence over scoring runs, sometimes deeming a century "awful" and a 15-run innings "the best" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. However, Sangakkara realized that technique must be effective in delivering quantifiable performance, as talent and potential without measurable output are insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

He had to figure out his method after being called into the national side without even a first-class century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. He experimented extensively with his technique, changing his grip, stance, tap, trigger movements, and the height of his stance depending on conditions and how he felt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. This adaptability allowed him to navigate tough periods in an innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

Sangakkara learned that "timing" meant being in sync with the present moment, rather than trying to recreate past successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. He focused on understanding the daily dynamics of the game and allowing his body to fall into sync, acknowledging that nuances like sleep, bowler rhythm, pitch changes, or weather could alter conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. He also shifted focus from "trying not to get out" to "scoring runs" and being effective, accepting that dismissal is inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

Key aspects of his batting success include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>:
*   **Self-understanding**: Helped plan training and react to challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **Openness to change**: Knowing change is inevitable and a must for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.
*   **Focus on scoring runs**: Not protecting reputation or legacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Every day is a new day**: Approaching each innings as a fresh start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

His period of absolute best batting, making multiple centuries in the 2015 World Cup and scoring heavily at Surrey, was a culmination of knowledge, experience, and physical ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. He continued to tweak his game even at the end of his career due to the necessity to score runs and adapt to physical changes with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. He believes it's better to anticipate changes and adapt sooner than be forced to change when one's back is against the wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

Sangakkara is highly competitive and wanted to be recognized as one of the greats, initially aiming for 20 centuries, then pushing for 25, then 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.

### Wicket-keeping and Batting Average
Sangakkara believes that giving up wicket-keeping in Test cricket helped his batting average significantly due to the physical and mental toll of batting at number three after long periods of keeping in challenging conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>. While keeping helped him get into the side initially, the fatigue affected his batting performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>. Giving up the gloves forced him to focus entirely on his batting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>. However, he notes that keeping also provided a firsthand understanding of pitch behavior, which aided his batting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>.

## Insights on Other Batters

### [[historical_cricketers_with_overlooked_achievements | Aravinda de Silva]]
Sangakkara considers [[historical_cricketers_with_overlooked_achievements | Aravinda de Silva]] a "genius" with a personality similar to Brian Lara, needing inspiration and motivation to perform at his best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>. He suggests that if [[historical_cricketers_with_overlooked_achievements | Aravinda]] had played in a more motivated Sri Lankan side from the start, he could have scored 40+ centuries and 13,000-14,000 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>. Sangakkara recalls [[historical_cricketers_with_overlooked_achievements | Aravinda]]'s casual approach to club cricket when unmotivated, contrasted with his fierce determination and brilliance when he had something to prove, often scoring 150-200 runs in a blink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>. [[historical_cricketers_with_overlooked_achievements | Aravinda]]'s time at Kent in the mid-90s also showed this transformation, as he became "incredible" when the sun came out and he embraced his professional responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:33">[00:28:33]</a>. He made runs in New Zealand on green pitches when young and used his gloves and bat as a "second line of defense" to watch the ball effectively, even without a visor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17">[00:37:17]</a>.

### [[comparison_of_cricket_legends | Mahela Jayawardene]]
[[comparison_of_cricket_legends | Mahela Jayawardene]] is described as "absolutely gifted," with a "lazy elegance" and plenty of time at the crease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>. Technically correct, his "easy movement of that front shoulder" and early ball-seeing allowed him to have an "incredible" complete game against both pace and spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:58">[00:30:58]</a>. Like [[historical_cricketers_with_overlooked_achievements | Aravinda]], Brian Lara, Ricky Ponting, and Matthew Hayden, [[comparison_of_cricket_legends | Mahela]] always looked to impose himself on the game, taking risks to stay on top of the bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>. Sangakkara enjoyed batting with him and [[historical_criketers_with_overlooked_achievements | Tilakaratne Dilshan]] due to their mutual understanding and ability to feed off each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>. From [[comparison_of_cricket_legends | Mahela]], Sangakkara learned the "value of runs" and how easy it is to avoid dismissal when constantly putting pressure on the bowler, as well as developing a better relationship with risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:53">[00:32:53]</a>.

### [[historical_cricketers_with_overlooked_achievements | Thilan Samaraweera]]
[[historical_cricketers_with_overlooked_achievements | Thilan Samaraweera]] is characterized as a hard worker, similar to Sangakkara himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:21">[00:35:21]</a>. He was brilliant against spin and found a method against pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:26">[00:35:26]</a>. Mentally strong, he was often the easiest player to drop from the lineup, which fueled his determination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>. He scored a run-a-ball century on debut against India on a turning pitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:40">[00:35:40]</a>. His strength against spin involved wrist work, driving down the ground, and hitting against the spinâ€”a hallmark of a great spin player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>. Originally an off-spinner, he became one of Sri Lanka's best Test match players and a very handy ODI player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>.

### [[greatest_test_batters_of_all_time | Virender Sehwag]]
Watching [[greatest_test_batters_of_all_time | Virender Sehwag]] from behind the stumps was "devastating" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>. His mantra was simple: "see ball, hit ball" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>. Sehwag "never really cared about preserving his wicket, looking good or being consistent or technical"; he was there to score runs and instill fear in bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>. As an example of his unique approach, he scored a double century in Galle during a period when Ajantha Mendis and Muttiah Muralitharan were dominating India, while other great batters struggled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:52">[00:41:52]</a>. Sehwag often insisted on reaching his century with a four or a six, even if it meant taking a high risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:17]</a>. Despite constantly offering opportunities for dismissal, he was a match-winner who, if given an early reprieve, would punish the opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:51">[00:42:51]</a>.

### [[greatest_test_batters_of_all_time | Younis Khan]]
[[greatest_test_batters_of_all_time | Younis Khan]] was described as "very easy on the eye" and "really great against fast bowling and spin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">[00:44:27]</a>. His sweeping was "just amazing," and he easily adapted to the reverse sweep later in his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:32">[00:44:32]</a>. Sangakkara suggests that [[greatest_test_batters_of_all_time | Younis]] might have been similar to him in constantly "tinkering" with his game, making him harder to line up for bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>.

### [[greatest_test_batters_of_all_time | Sachin Tendulkar]]
[[greatest_test_batters_of_all_time | Sachin Tendulkar]] was "technically amazing" and adapted his stance throughout his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:35">[00:46:35]</a>. He was naturally superb against both pace and spin, "forward thinking," reading the game and opposition well, and capable of scoring runs on any pitch, anywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:57">[00:46:57]</a>. Sangakkara highlights his ability to understand what shots to play, often using only a few shots for much of an innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:23">[00:47:23]</a>. [[greatest_test_batters_of_all_time | Sachin]]'s greatest attributes were his passion for the game, thirst for runs, and incredible ability to withstand immense pressure from a billion fans constantly chanting his name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>. His 24-25 year career and 200 Test matches are a testament to his character, personality, ability, talent, steel, determination, and grit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:54">[00:47:54]</a>.

### [[best_test_cricket_allrounders_in_history | Jacques Kallis]]
[[best_test_cricket_allrounders_in_history | Jacques Kallis]] is praised for his all-round ability, with Sangakkara wondering "how he did it bowling so much and so well and then batting like he did" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:02">[00:50:02]</a>. Kallis produced an incredible volume of runs, described as "very workmanlike, almost like a machine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:15">[00:50:15]</a>. He was powerful and imposing yet very compact for a big man, possessing a unique method that he could consistently reproduce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>. Mentally very strong, Kallis performed incredibly well in any condition, batting at the crucial number three position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:04">[00:51:04]</a>. He was one of the first players Sangakkara saw to get outside off stump against off-spin and play everything as if it was off his pads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:22">[00:51:22]</a>. Cricketers universally hold Kallis in awe and speak of him with great respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:11">[00:52:11]</a>.

### [[greatest_test_batters_of_all_time | Matthew Hayden]]
Sangakkara believes [[greatest_test_batters_of_all_time | Matthew Hayden]]'s greatest strength was "upstairs" in his mind, and he viewed himself as a "gentle giant" who was also soft-spoken off the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:54">[00:52:54]</a>. Once he found his way into the side as an opener, he aimed to impose himself, score runs, and "show these bowlers whose boss" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:32">[00:53:32]</a>. Sangakkara points out that despite Hayden's brutal batting style, he thought deeply about the game, particularly his ability to sweep consistently against spin, which was "a very un-Australian thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:42">[00:53:42]</a>. He was so powerful and intimidating that short leg fielders sometimes wore chest pads under their helmets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:03">[00:54:03]</a>. Hayden prided himself on anticipating what bowlers would do and staying one step ahead of the opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:15">[00:54:15]</a>.

### [[greatest_test_batters_of_all_time | Brian Lara]]
Sangakkara aspired to bat like [[greatest_test_batters_of_all_time | Brian Lara]], who he says "just had everything," except perhaps a thirst for consistency, as he only wanted to win games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:07">[00:55:07]</a>. [[greatest_test_batters_of_all_time | Lara]] had an incredible ability to step up and dominate when challenged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:20">[00:55:20]</a>. Sangakkara witnessed him score 680 runs in three Tests against Sri Lanka with Muralitharan and Vaas in top form, yet the West Indies still lost 3-0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:27">[00:55:27]</a>. [[greatest_test_batters_of_all_time | Lara]]'s level of genius is hard to describe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:47">[00:55:47]</a>. He possessed a "swagger" on the field, and his batting was so good that Sangakkara felt "grateful to have watched him score runs against you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:30">[00:56:30]</a>. Despite coaches advising against it, his unique high backlift and flourish made him incredible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>. When [[greatest_test_batters_of_all_time | Lara]] made a statement, it created "world global headlines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:30">[00:57:30]</a>. He also possessed a great cricket brain, determination, and mental strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:47">[00:57:47]</a>.

## Evolution of Batting
Sangakkara believes that if he were to play in the current generation, he would bat with more freedom, understanding the value of entertainment in the sport and chasing wins aggressively in any format due to the influence of T20 cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>. He notes that players today play with "a lot more abandon, a lot more freedom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:32">[00:59:32]</a>.

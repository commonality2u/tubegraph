From: [[goodareaslive]] <br/> 

The "chasing obsession" has become deeply ingrained in the philosophy of [[player_roles_and_strategies_in_t20_cricket | T20 cricket]] teams over the past decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Since 2013, teams have opted to bat second more often than they have chosen to bat first after winning the toss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

While there is a slight advantage for chasing, with teams winning 53% of games when bowling first compared to 47% when batting first, this margin is often perceived as much larger by fans and potentially even players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Many fans believe the toss is the only thing that matters, estimating a winning percentage for chasing at around 70%, far higher than the actual 53% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. This strategy is largely influenced by analysts, with players backing their recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

## Comparison of International and Franchise T20 Cricket Strategies

There is a notable divergence in decision-making regarding the toss between international and franchise T20 teams:

*   **International Teams:** Since 2023, international teams occasionally opt to bat first, doing so about one-third of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   **Franchise Teams:** In contrast, franchise teams almost always opt to field first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. For example, in the Caribbean Premier League (CPL), teams choose to field first 85% of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Despite this, teams batting first in the CPL still win 50% of their games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

This difference may stem from the competitive balance; franchise leagues tend to have more "level" teams, whereas international cricket features more "mismatches" or "extreme kinds of teams" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

### Strategic Mindlessness

The widespread adoption of chasing as an automatic choice across both formats is often described as "mindless" and "unthinking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

*   **General Trend:** In 2022, teams won more games batting first, yet this had no impact on decision-making at the toss, highlighting a reluctance to deviate from the established norm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   **Lack of Correlation:** From 2017, when the fielding-first philosophy became particularly strong (around 75% of tosses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>), teams batting first still won 47% of games, indicating a lack of strong correlation between the toss decision and victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
*   **Optimal Strategy:** It is suggested that if a team truly believes in an advantage, they should pursue it 100% of the time, or if not, they shouldn't commit to it so heavily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. This points to a disconnect where teams are following a strategy without being entirely sure how to implement it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

### Impact of Weather Conditions

The impact of [[impact_of_t20_cricket_on_modern_bowling | dew]] is a major factor often cited for choosing to bowl first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. However, analysis suggests that dew doesn't always play as significant a role as perceived, with it sometimes appearing in the first innings or not at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. The 53-47 winning split suggests that neither dew nor the challenge of setting totals are as prohibitive as teams believe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

Teams should assess individual grounds, consult curators about dew, and consider other factors like temperature and rain forecasts, which are often overlooked in the automatic decision-making process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.

### Case Studies: Specific International Teams

*   **Pakistan:** Despite having a stronger team when setting totals and a deficiency in that area, Pakistan frequently opts to field first in bilateral T20s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. This decision hinders their preparation for T20 World Cups, where they cannot control the toss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. For instance, in 2024, they lost to the USA after being sent in to bat first by England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.
*   **Afghanistan:** This international side is an exception, opting to bat first more than 30% of the time, a strategy that aligns with their squad composition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. However, even this percentage could be higher given their strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.
*   **England:** From 2016 onwards, England opted to bat first only 6-7% of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. Between the start of 2017 and the end of 2021, they never opted to bat first once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>. This is despite winning over 50% of their games when they *did* bat first during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. This unwavering approach, even in conditions like Guyana where the pitch was known to slow down, suggests a feedback loop where they convince themselves their predominant strategy is the only winning one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.
*   **India:** While also often opting to bowl first automatically like England, India demonstrated adaptability in the 2024 T20 World Cup, making a "cricket decision" to bat first in Guyana and winning the final after batting first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.

### Implications for Tournament Preparation

For international teams, bilateral T20s are seen as meaningless compared to the T20 World Cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. Teams should use these opportunities to improve their weaknesses, such as batting first if that is a deficiency, rather than always optimizing for a win that has no impact on long-term goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. This approach would ensure both aspects of their game are ready for knockout matches where the toss cannot be predicted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.

### Future Considerations

As [[impact_of_ipl_scoring_trends | T20 scoring trends]] evolve, with teams now able to score 260-280 runs, the pressure of chasing these massive totals may change the dynamics of the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>. This could potentially lead to a shift in the perceived advantage of chasing or even prompt cricket authorities to consider rule changes, such as allowing the away team to decide whether to bat or bowl first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>.

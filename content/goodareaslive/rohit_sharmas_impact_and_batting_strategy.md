Rohit Sharma's performance in the Cricket World Cup has been described as the "Rohit Sharma of my dreams," fulfilling long-held expectations of his aggressive batting style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:48">[02:57:48]</a>. His approach in the semi-final against New Zealand was characterized by a clear intent for "carnage," aiming to beat them within the first 10 overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:48">[01:04:48]</a>.

## Batting Strategy

[[rohit_sharmas_batting_strategy_and_position_in_ipl | Rohit Sharma's batting strategy]] in this World Cup has been marked by an ultra-aggressive approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>. He has set an example for the team, demonstrating how he wants them to play, specifically by trying to score quicker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>. This contrasts with previous World Cups where Indian batters were perceived as playing a timid and conservative brand of cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>.

## Power Play Dominance

[[rohit_sharmas_performance_as_an_opener | Rohit Sharma]] holds the record for the most runs ever in a batting power play (first 10 overs) in World Cup history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. Historically, teams didn't score as quickly in the early overs, making his current performance stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

### Comparison to Other Legends
*   **Brendon McCullum (2015)**: Scored 308 runs at two runs a ball in the power play, considered "light years ahead of his time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.
*   **Matthew Hayden (2007)**: Made 254 runs in the tournament, though with no average as he never went out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>.

In this tournament, [[rohit_sharmas_performance_as_an_opener | Rohit Sharma]] and Shubman Gill, India's two openers, both score better than a run a ball in the first 10 overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>. [[rohit_sharmas_performance_as_an_opener | Rohit Sharma]] has had an "absolutely fantastic" World Cup, scoring at eight runs an over in the power play and averaging 88.5 with 354 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>. This places him uniquely between McCullum and Hayden in terms of impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.

## Impact on Team India

[[impact_of_captaincy_on_rohit_sharmas_career_and_performance | Rohit Sharma]] is seen as the "main difference" between India and other teams, primarily because of the pressure he exerts on the opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>. India's batting in the power play, led by [[rohit_sharmas_performance_for_mumbai_indians | Rohit Sharma]], boasts an average of 69 and a scoring rate of more than a run a ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>. This provides a "huge advantage" over other teams in every game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>.

### Intent and Comparison to Previous Tournaments

This demonstrates India's deliberate "intent" to score quicker, a strategy emphasized by [[comparison_of_rohit_sharmas_roles_for_mumbai_indians_and_india | Rohit Sharma]] to his team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>.

[[comparison_of_rohit_sharmas_roles_for_mumbai_indians_and_india | Rohit Sharma]] has transformed his game to become the player the team needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22:00">[15:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26:00">[15:26:00]</a>.

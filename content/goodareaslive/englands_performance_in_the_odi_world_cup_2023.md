England's campaign in the [[Cricket World Cup 2023 analysis | ODI World Cup 2023]] has been characterized by a notable decline in form and a questioning of their aggressive playing style. The team's overall performance has been perceived as lacking certainty and effectiveness, a stark contrast to their previous success [00:01:17].

## Overall Campaign Assessment

Despite perceptions of their attacking intent, England's play has been described as "not playing very well" [00:01:30]. Their approach has been an "illusion of attacking," with players like Ben Stokes "dead batting" the ball and Jonny Bairstow playing like a man distracted [00:01:45], [00:02:04]. The team has been in a state of confusion throughout the tournament, lacking clear direction [00:02:18].

Compared to other teams, Sri Lanka and even lesser-ranked sides like the Netherlands and Bangladesh appear to have performed better or at least wondered how England managed to lose to them [00:38:25], [00:38:32]. The general sentiment is that England has lacked "fight" and "answers" due to a widespread dip in player form across the squad [00:43:11], [00:44:15].

Nasser Hussain pointed out that there isn't a "better squad out there" for England [00:34:16]. Key players like Harry Brook have not been "Difference Makers" [00:34:52], and Liam Livingstone's strong form from before the tournament has vanished [00:34:55]. The team is seen as "aging out" [00:51:04]. Many of their successful players, including Joe Root, Eoin Morgan, Ben Stokes, Jonny Bairstow, Jos Buttler, Alex Hales, Jason Roy, Dawid Malan, and Moeen Ali, developed in the Pro40 Cricket era (before 2011-2012), a format that no longer exists [00:49:47]. Only Reece Topley and Adil Rashid are considered to be performing at their expected level [00:33:39], with David Willey showing occasional good bowling [00:34:02].

## Batting Performance

England's batting has shown significant issues in [[cricket_statistics_and_player_performances_in_world_cup_2023 | various statistical categories]].

### Shot Rotation and Defensive Play

England has averaged only 24 runs per wicket when attempting to rotate the strike, a figure far below the typical 50-60 runs expected in ODI cricket [00:19:50], [00:19:56]. In contrast, teams like India and South Africa combined average 473 runs when rotating the strike [00:20:26]. This suggests England is not effectively getting off strike [00:20:07].

Furthermore, England has been notably high on the list for wickets lost to defensive shots in this World Cup [00:20:48]. This contradicts the popular narrative of their "over-attacking" style, indicating they are not only defending more but also doing so poorly [00:20:57], [00:21:05].

### Individual Dismissals and Shot Selection

The [[analysis_of_ind_vs_eng_odi_match_in_cwc2023 | match against Sri Lanka]] highlighted specific batting failures:

*   **Dawid Malan:** Dismissed by Angelo Mathews, Malan was trying to guide a "slow but good ball" down to third man. While not an overly attacking shot, the ball nipped away more than anticipated [00:23:36].
*   **Jonny Bairstow:** His dismissal was described as a "half attempt" shot, trying to force an attacking play from a pre-determined decision on a ball that was neither full, short, nor wide [00:24:50], [00:25:05].
*   **Jos Buttler:** Jos Buttler's vulnerability to balls outside his eye line on a length outside off stump was exploited, even in Indian conditions [00:21:48], [00:22:29]. His dismissal showed him trying to drive a wide length ball, getting a thick edge [00:26:09], [00:27:06]. This was not considered "over attacking" [00:27:17].
*   **Liam Livingstone:** Pitched a foot outside off stump, the ball darted back in violently, hitting the top of leg stump. Livingstone may have pre-decided to attack a ball that turned out to be better than he assumed [00:27:47], [00:28:18].
*   **Moeen Ali:** Dismissed by a "rank" short ball from Angelo Mathews at ~75 mph [00:30:06], [00:30:14]. This was seen as a "wishy-washy half attempt shot," indicating poor form and a lack of conviction [00:29:36], [00:29:47].
*   **Chris Woakes:** Played a shot to a wide, full ball outside off stump that typically gets slashed away for runs. While he may not have fully committed, it's a shot that often succeeds [00:30:33], [00:31:10].

Overall, the dismissals were not primarily due to recklessness, but rather a combination of "half shots," and players failing to execute their usual attacking plays, or being out of form [00:32:30].

## Running Between Wickets

England's running between wickets has been highlighted as problematic, contributing to their woes [00:13:38].

*   **Joe Root Run Out:** In the match against Sri Lanka, Joe Root was run out due to a miscommunication and his stuttering on the run [00:14:31]. The ball sat up perfectly for the fielder, and the stumps were dramatically dislodged by Kusal Mendis [00:14:26], [00:14:59].
*   **Adil Rashid Run Out:** Adil Rashid was run out after following through and walking down the crease, showing a lack of focus. Kusal Mendis quickly reacted, seeing Rashid out of his crease and throwing down the stumps [00:17:37], [00:18:36]. Despite Rashid's experience as a "proper player" with 10 first-class hundreds, this was an error that "absolutely did not need to happen" [00:18:51], [00:18:58].

These run-outs suggest fundamental errors in communication and focus rather than an aggressive, yet failed, strategy [00:19:31].

## Comparisons and Future Outlook

The current [[Englands performance in the ODI World Cup 2023 | England World Cup campaign]] is seen as more frustrating than their 2015 campaign, as they expected to perform better after winning a recent T20 World Cup [00:41:33], [00:41:56]. The team's decision to pivot towards T20s due to two T20 World Cups has had consequences for their ODI performance [00:41:23].

There is a concern that this "golden generation" of English cricketers, who dominated in Pro40 Cricket, is aging out, and there isn't the same level of talent coming through in the younger generation [00:49:47], [00:50:36].

Joe Root's role has been essential to England's batting, similar to the importance of Steve Smith for [[Australias cricket strategy and performance in ODI World Cup 2023 | Australia]] or Virat Kohli for [[Indian cricket team performance in CWC 2023 | India]] [00:51:31]. Root, Eoin Morgan, and Ben Stokes formed a crucial "middle overs machine" in previous successful campaigns, scoring quickly and selflessly, with Root and Stokes offering bowling talent, and Morgan providing captaincy [00:52:02], [00:52:20]. Their absence or lack of form (Root not playing enough ODIs, Stokes not playing enough ODIs, Morgan commentating) is a significant issue for the team [00:52:50].

The issues facing England in this World Cup are complex, ranging from a lack of bowling depth to a collective dip in batting form, making it a challenging situation for the team to address [00:51:12]. The performance patterns suggest that the team is grappling with more than just poor execution of an aggressive strategy; there's a deeper issue of form and potentially a generational shift [00:32:27], [00:32:50].

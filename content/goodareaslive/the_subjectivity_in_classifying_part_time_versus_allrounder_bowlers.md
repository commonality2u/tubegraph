From: [[goodareaslive]] <br/> 
The classification of a bowler as "part-time" versus an "all-rounder" or even a "fifth bowler" in cricket is highly subjective and lacks a universally agreed-upon definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### Defining Part-Time Bowlers
The challenge in precisely defining a part-time bowler is significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. One attempt in ODI cricket suggested that averaging more than five overs per game might qualify a player as a bowler, but this included players like Darren Lehmann and Viv Richards, who are not typically considered all-rounders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. The distinction can further blur between a part-time and an occasional bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Cricket discussions, such as those found in articles like King Cricket or old forums, frequently grapple with this exact ambiguity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Ultimately, classifying players in this category often relies on subjective interpretation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

### Ambiguity with All-Rounders
A core aspect of this subjectivity arises when distinguishing between true all-rounders and part-time bowlers. Some players' career statistics might appear "part-time," but this could be due to external factors, such as injuries affecting their bowling careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

Players like Steve Waugh were initially selected for their bowling prowess, but later injury issues caused their bowling numbers to reflect a part-time role, even though he was a "fantastic bowler" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Similarly, Hansie Cronje, despite his capabilities, was often the sixth bowling option for South Africa due to the abundance of other all-rounders in his team like Shaun Pollock and Jacques Kallis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

The discussion also highlights a difference between an "all-rounder who wasn't very good at bowling" and a "part-timer who was made to bowl a lot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. This distinction often comes down to whether a player was originally selected for their all-round abilities or if their bowling was merely a supplemental skill.

### Notable Cases and Examples

*   **[[notable_part_time_bowlers_like_sachin_tendulkar_and_carl_hooper | Sachin Tendulkar]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>:
    *   His classification is debated; while his Test record (46 wickets at 54 average) was "poor," his ODI record (154 wickets at 44 average, 5.1 economy) was seen as "handy" for picking up wickets and breaking partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
    *   He was never consistently a team's fifth bowler but could bowl various styles, including medium pace, off-spin, and leg-spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. His T20I record is peculiar, with 1 wicket in 15 deliveries at an average of 12 and an economy of 4.8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

*   **Michael Bevan** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>:
    *   A "fascinating" case, as he sometimes played Test cricket specifically for his bowling, despite "actively fighting the urge to bowl" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
    *   He took 29 Test wickets at 24.31 (including a 10-wicket haul) but only 36 ODI wickets in 232 matches at 46.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. His unique left-arm leg-spin was bowled at an unusual pace, sometimes resembling the speed of Tiger O'Reilly or Chandra Sekar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

*   **[[notable_part_time_bowlers_like_sachin_tendulkar_and_carl_hooper | Carl Hooper]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>:
    *   He had "admirable" statistics with 114 Test wickets at 49.42 and 193 ODI wickets at 36.05 with an economy of 4.36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
    *   Despite these numbers, his bowling action suggested a lack of interest in the "craft," but he was a "natural athlete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. He's considered a part-timer "in spirit" who was often "made to bowl a lot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

*   **Mohammad Hafeez** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>:
    *   His inclusion as a part-timer is debatable due to his higher wicket count: 53 Test wickets at 35, 139 ODI wickets at 28.84, and 61 T20I wickets at 22.75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.
    *   He was a third spinner alongside Saeed Ajmal and Shahid Afridi during a phase where he bowled frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. Some argue he was an all-rounder who wasn't particularly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

*   **Sanath Jayasuriya** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>:
    *   Despite his significant wicket tally (third most for Sri Lanka at retirement), he is deemed *not* a part-timer because he was originally selected as a bowler who later developed his batting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.

*   **Doug Walters** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>:
    *   A "blast from the past" pick, he took 49 wickets in 74 Tests at an impressive average of 29 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.
    *   He was known for taking wickets quickly when conditions favored him but often "didn't even want to continue to bowl" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. His infrequent use (bowling in 72 of 74 Test innings and 10 of 28 ODI innings) supports his part-time status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.

*   **Michael Clarke** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>:
    *   Had 31 wickets in 115 Tests and 57 in 245 ODIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>.
    *   Remembered for match-winning performances like 6/9 in India, which might inflate the perception of his bowling frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>. His back issues later limited his bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>. He possessed a good loop and curve that looked like they would spin but often went straight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>.

*   **Aravinda de Silva** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>:
    *   Considered a "true" part-time Sri Lankan bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:43">[00:25:43]</a>.
    *   He took 29 wickets in 58 Test innings and 106 wickets in 156 ODI innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>. His impactful performances, particularly in the 1996 World Cup, influenced the perception of his bowling abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>.

*   **Simon Katich** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>:
    *   Regarded by some as the "best test part-time bowler of all time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:49">[00:27:49]</a>.
    *   He took 21 wickets in 56 Tests at an average of 30, but only bowled in 25 innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>. He "hated bowling" and had to be "dragged to the crease" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:25">[00:28:25]</a>. He never bowled in ODIs or T20Is, making him a "proper part-timer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>.

*   **Nathan Astle** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>:
    *   A military medium-pacer with 51 wickets in 81 Tests at 42.16 and 99 wickets in 223 ODIs at 38.47 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>. His T20I record is 4 wickets in 4 games at an average of 12.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">[00:30:15]</a>.

*   **Craig McMillan** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>:
    *   Compared to Nathan Astle, he is seen as more "quintessentially part-time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>.
    *   He believed he should have been a new-ball bowler despite only bowling around 125 km/h <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>. His record includes 28 wickets in 55 Tests at 44.96 and 49 wickets in 197 ODIs at 35 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:29">[00:37:29]</a>.

*   **Chris Gayle** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:19">[00:33:19]</a>:
    *   Continues the West Indian tradition of batters bowling a lot due to a lack of specialist spinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a>.
    *   His stats include 73 wickets in 103 Tests at 42.73, 167 wickets in 301 ODIs at 35.48, and 20 wickets in 79 T20Is at 22 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:22">[00:33:22]</a>. He was never picked for his bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:21">[00:34:21]</a>.

*   **Andrew Symonds** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:46">[00:38:46]</a>:
    *   Debated as an all-rounder vs. part-timer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>. He bowled both seam and spin, effectively acting as two different types of part-timers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:32">[00:39:32]</a>.
    *   His international record of 24 Test wickets in 41 innings and 133 ODI wickets in 158 innings at averages over 37, suggests a part-time role despite extensive domestic bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:34">[00:41:34]</a>.

*   **Charlotte Edwards** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>:
    *   Described as "one of the worst part-timers" purely aesthetically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01">[00:44:01]</a>, yet had a "pretty decent" ODI record of 54 wickets in 51 innings at an average of 21 and an economy of 4.3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:36">[00:43:36]</a>. Her Test record was 12 wickets in 20 innings at 48 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a>.

*   **[[analysis_of_joe_root_as_a_modern_part_time_bowler | Joe Root]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:58">[00:45:58]</a>:
    *   Consistently argued *not* to be an all-rounder, but rather a "really good sixth bowler" or part-timer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:05">[00:46:05]</a>.
    *   His Test average is 45.36 (71 wickets in 152 Tests) and his ODI average is 61.85 (28 wickets in 177 ODIs), indicating he is "not very good at taking wickets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:37">[00:46:37]</a>. He is known for his clever variations like the carrom ball, leg-spin, and off-spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:42">[00:47:42]</a>.

*   **Yuvraj Singh** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>:
    *   His limited overs performances, including being crucial to India's World Cup win, bolster his case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:11">[00:49:11]</a>.
    *   His Test record is poor (9 wickets in 40 Tests at 60.77), but his ODI record is impressive (111 wickets in 304 ODIs at 38.68) and his T20I record is strong (28 wickets at 17.82) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:02">[00:49:02]</a>. He is considered one of the few part-timers who potentially had the talent to be a frontline bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:07">[00:50:07]</a>.

Other players mentioned in the subjective discussion of part-timers include:
*   Darren Lehmann (strong part-time record) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>

*   Glenn Phillips (career ongoing, could become an all-rounder) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:42">[00:51:42]</a>
*   Sourav Ganguly (good ODI record, poor Test average) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:49">[00:52:49]</a>
*   Viv Richards (averaged over 61 in Tests) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:56">[00:52:56]</a>

*   Hamilton Masakadza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:06">[00:54:06]</a>
*   Travis Head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:18">[00:54:18]</a>
*   Mudasir Nazar and Asif Iqbal (possibly all-rounders who bowled less due to team composition) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>
*   Virender Sehwag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:48">[00:55:48]</a>
*   Russell Arnold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>
*   Steve Tikolo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:08">[00:56:08]</a>
*   Greg Chappell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:33">[00:56:33]</a>

*   Mark Waugh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:04">[00:57:04]</a>
*   Mark Butcher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:10">[00:57:10]</a>
*   Jeremy Coney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:42">[00:57:42]</a>
*   Kane Williamson (ruled ineligible due to bowling action issues) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:43">[00:58:43]</a>.

The challenge of classifying these players highlights that a single statistical benchmark cannot capture the nuance of their roles, performance, and team context, making it an inherently subjective exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:02">[00:58:02]</a>.

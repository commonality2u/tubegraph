From: [[goodareaslive]] <br/> 

Sri Lanka entered the tournament facing significant challenges, including a "ton of injuries" and opting for a "very young lineup" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. They also played on pitches that were beneficial to batsmen, making it difficult for their bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Bowling Performance
Initially, Sri Lanka's bowling unit struggled significantly. Over their first three games, their bowlers averaged around 75 runs per wicket with an economy rate of 7.38 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This placed them alongside teams like England, [[Pakistans cricket strategy and performance issues | Pakistan]], and Bangladesh in terms of poor bowling performance, averaging 46.53 runs per wicket and being the most expensive team at 6.44 runs per over across the tournament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

### Turnaround
Despite the rough start, Sri Lanka showed a "hell of a turnaround" in their bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. In their last two games, their bowling average improved dramatically to 24 runs per wicket, with an economy rate of 4.92 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. This improvement was attributed to:
*   Bowling on pitches that were more helpful to their bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   Bringing in "a lot more experienced Bowlers," including older players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   Improved lengths and more movement off the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

In a recent match, they successfully "dried up the boundaries" from overs 5.4 to 14.1, contributing to the lowest-ever first innings total at Chinnaswamy stadium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

## Angelo Mathews' Impact
Angelo Mathews, despite being past his peak career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a> and not part of Sri Lanka's initial World Cup plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>, was brought into the squad as a replacement for Pathirana, who was injured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. He had not bowled in an ODI since 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>, but made an immediate impact against England, taking two wickets and contributing to a run-out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. His performance was unexpected, with one commentator likening his bowling to "dibbly dobly Bowlers" and calling him an "absolute genius at the craft" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

Mathews was not a regular feature in Sri Lanka's ODI lineup between the 2019 and 2023 World Cups, playing only 10 out of 56 matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

## Batting Performance
Sri Lanka's power play batting has been a strength, ranking as the second fastest batting team in the power play, only behind [[Indias batting and bowling strategies | India]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. This aggressive approach, notably influenced by Kusal Mendis, has also seen them maintain a respectable average, ranking fourth overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

### Key Batsmen
*   **Kusal Mendis**: Exploded in the early part of the World Cup, benefiting from good batting wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. His form, however, "stalled" after the initial innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.
*   **Pathum Nissanka**: Has been in "really good form" during the World Cup, averaging 38 with a strike rate of 84 in the World Cup cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.
*   **Sadeera Samarawickrama**: Played 16 out of 17 games in 2023, making a late decision to bring him in for the World Cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. He gained significant experience in a short period through the World Cup qualifiers and Asia Cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

## Overall Assessment
While their recent performances have been good, particularly against England and the Netherlands, there is caution against overstating their improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. The wins might be partially attributed to weaker opposition, and the team is still not at its full strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:13">[00:38:13]</a>. Some commentators believe that Sri Lanka is showing signs of being a "better team" than others like Bangladesh or the Netherlands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:25">[00:38:25]</a>. They are considered to still have a chance to qualify for the playoffs due to their remaining fixtures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:13">[00:57:13]</a>.

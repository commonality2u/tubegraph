Fan culture in [[cricket_and_player_performances | cricket]] has evolved significantly, particularly with the rise of franchise leagues like the Indian Premier League (IPL). While the passion of fans can be infectious, it has also led to intense rivalries and, at times, unsavory behavior, prompting discussions about the need for greater [[empathy_in_cricket_commentary_and_analysis | empathy]] and safety in the sport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:06">[03:06:06]</a>.

## Intense Rivalries and Unsavory Incidents

The match between Chennai Super Kings (CSK) and Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) highlighted the extreme nature of modern fan rivalries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:02">[03:54:02]</a>. Following RCB's home victory, instances of fan clashes and inappropriate conduct were observed:
*   Mocking opposing team players as their bus left the stadium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:15">[04:17:15]</a>.
*   Physical altercations between rival fans, including CSK and RCB supporters who were local to Bangalore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:28">[04:28:28]</a>.
*   Heckling of women, which was deemed "unsavory" and "in bad taste" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.
*   Fans displaying white t-shirts with black lines, referencing CSK's two-year ban, depicting players in jail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:05">[04:05:05]</a>. This level of intensity is seen as going "beyond sport" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Concern for Safety
> There is a significant concern when fans "don't feel safe at the stadium" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. This issue draws parallels to the "hooliganism" seen in football (soccer), where it took considerable time to address and elements still persist, including racism and sexism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.

## The Power of Passion

Despite the negative aspects, the passion of fans is a vital and positive force in [[cricket_media_and_storytelling | cricket]].
*   The RCB fanbase is considered the "most full-on" in the IPL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:25">[03:55:25]</a>. Their enthusiastic embrace of the RCB women's team victory was particularly noteworthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.
*   This intense fan loyalty demonstrates that the sport has transcended mere marketing and public relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. Unlike newer leagues like The Hundred, the IPL has cultivated a deep-seated fan connection, with supporters genuinely invested in their teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.
*   The growth of this passion since the IPL's inception has transformed it into a rivalry focused on team identity, moving beyond just the celebrity or "Bollywood" aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.

## Role of Sport in Society

Sport serves as a "conduit to get out all the crap" from people's lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. It functions as a replacement for warfare, where the satisfaction of one's community being stronger or smarter is channeled through sporting victories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. Historically, sporting clubs like Manchester City and Manchester United were formed to provide a structured environment for teenagers involved in street crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>.

While sport allows for the release of passion, it must remain accessible and safe for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. The increasing toxicity in fan behavior, where passions become "life and death" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>, is a concern that [[cricket_and_player_performances | cricket]] has not traditionally faced at this level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.

## Evolution of Fan Loyalty

In franchise [[cricket_and_player_performances | cricket]], fan loyalty is shifting towards local teams, similar to how fans follow clubs in other sports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>. This contrasts with traditional national or international team affiliations.
*   Teams like Mumbai Indians, RCB, and CSK are noted for having the strongest fan bases and being the most successful business-wise in the IPL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>.
*   There are teams that people "love to hate," such as Mumbai Indians, RCB, and CSK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>.
*   The "choking" narrative, similar to South Africa's reputation in World Cups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:00">[11:50:00]</a>, is often applied to RCB, with fans expecting them to lose despite strong performances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:00">[11:59:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Franchise Loyalty vs. Player Loyalty
> Unlike football, where star players typically remain with one franchise, [[cricket_and_player_performances | cricket]] players frequently move between teams across different leagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>. This fluidity challenges the notion of unwavering fan loyalty to specific players within a team.

While the passion and intensity of fans are seen as great for the sport, there's a strong sentiment that it should not lead to physical altercations or unsafe environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. The focus should be on celebrating the game, not on turning rivalries into hostile encounters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

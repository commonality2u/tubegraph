## Creating a Current T20 World XI/XII

The 29th episode of the Crick Pics podcast centered on selecting the best current T20 World 11 (later expanded to a World 12). The primary criterion for selection was current form, with past records not being a factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. The selection process followed a snake-style draft, with each participant getting four picks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.

## Top Picks and Their Qualities

### Jasprit Bumrah
Jasprit Bumrah was the unanimous first pick, consistently chosen in previous shows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. He is considered the best all-format cricketer in contemporary cricket, peaking in T20s after injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. He had a stellar IPL and has been performing exceptionally in the T20 World Cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. Bumrah is described as unplayable, possessing a never-ending bag of tricks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>, capable of bowling in all phases, bowling dry, and being an outright wicket-taker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. His unique angle of delivery contributes to his success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.

### Travis Head
Travis Head was selected as an opener due to his exceptional current form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. He has evolved into a "new kind of Beast" with a mentality to hit from ball one, as seen in the IPL for Sunrisers Hyderabad and for Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. His approach of "g[unning] it as hard as you can" and not overthinking leads to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>. Head is also highlighted as a big-game player, having been Man of the Match in the ODI World Cup Final and the World Test Championship Final <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>.

### Heinrich Klaasen
Heinrich Klaasen is regarded as possibly the best batter in the world in the middle order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>. He has made a massive impact on South Africa's performance, making no target safe with his ability to "go berserk" in the middle and later overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>. Klaasen is an "absolute monster versus spin," considered "as elite as elite gets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>. He has developed a new shot (the back-foot straight pull) with a wide arc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>. His strike rates are quicker than the average batter across all phases, and he consistently makes a lot of runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:12:00]</a>. He has "mastered the unmasterable art of staying in for ages whilst hammering everything," operating at strike rates of 180 while not getting out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>. He is seen as a "cheat code" due to his anomalous performance metrics, comparable to Viv Richards in ODIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:00">[12:24:00]</a>.

### Kuldeep Yadav
Kuldeep Yadav was picked as a bowler, specifically a wrist spinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:22:00">[14:22:00]</a>. He is seen as a "massive wicket-taking option" and one of the best spinners in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:08:00">[15:08:00]</a>. His ability to provide immense control for a left-arm wrist spinner is noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26:00">[16:26:00]</a>.

### Suryakumar Yadav (SKY)
Suryakumar Yadav is recognized for having "disrupted the game" and "changed T20 cricket" with his 360-degree play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:37:00">[17:37:00]</a>. His style is "exotic" and dissimilar to other 360-degree players like AB de Villiers or Jos Buttler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:53:00">[17:53:00]</a>. Length does not matter to him, and he recently proved his pedigree on tough batting conditions by scoring a match-winning half-century against the USA in New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:58:00">[17:58:00]</a>. He is one of the most devastating ball strikers in the modern game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:20:00">[18:20:00]</a>.

### Matheesha Pathirana
Matheesha Pathirana is identified as a "gun bowler" and the best strike bowler currently in white ball cricket, second only to Jasprit Bumrah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:11:00">[22:11:00]</a>. His delivery comes from an "awful angle" and has an "outlier" release point, making him difficult to face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:48:00">[22:48:00]</a>. He gets many bowled dismissals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:52:00">[22:52:00]</a>. Despite being very young, his current form is "really really good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:17:00">[23:17:00]</a>, and he was unplayable in a recent game against the Netherlands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:48:00">[23:48:00]</a>. He clocks 150 km/h consistently, has a slow one, a bouncer, and a full skill set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:11:00">[25:11:00]</a>.

### Andre Russell
Andre Russell is an all-rounder who is "still going strong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:12:00">[26:12:00]</a>. He is experienced with the ball, capable of bowling effective short balls in the middle overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:17:00">[26:17:00]</a>. While not considered a death bowler, he can get wickets by inducing catches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:38:00">[26:38:00]</a>. He remains a "gun fielder" and is "ludicrous with the bat," known for hitting the ball extremely hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:05:00">[27:05:00]</a>. He can adapt his game, as shown by a recent 30 off 17 without a six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:15:00">[27:15:00]</a>. Russell is described as almost the blueprint for an all-round T20 cricketer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:47:00">[27:47:00]</a>.

### Jos Buttler
Jos Buttler is seen as a versatile opener, capable of playing through different gears based on game situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:06:00">[30:06:00]</a>. His ability to perform both anchor and aggressive roles makes him difficult to overlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:19:00">[31:19:00]</a>. He is a strong candidate for captaincy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:10:00">[30:10:00]</a>. He excels at ramps, scoops, and has a "killer reverse sweep" that is second nature to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:35:00">[30:35:00]</a>. Buttler is experienced and not easily bogged down by conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:44:00">[30:44:00]</a>.

### Nicholas Pooran
Nicholas Pooran is considered, behind Heinrich Klaasen, possibly the best striker of the ball currently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:30:00">[32:30:00]</a>. He is also a wicketkeeper, providing replacement options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:35:00">[32:35:00]</a>. His left-handed option in the middle order is important for matchups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:12:00">[33:12:00]</a>. He can be used at the top of the order or as a finisher, and once he starts hitting, he doesn't stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:42:00">[34:42:00]</a>.

### Rashid Khan
Rashid Khan is a highly effective leg spinner, known for being consistently good for a long time with hardly any dips in form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:08:00">[35:08:00]</a>. His fielding is highlighted as a significant but often overlooked aspect of his game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:05:00">[36:05:00]</a>. He is considered by some to be the best ever wrist spinner in T20 cricket, taking 4 for 7 against New Zealand in a recent T20 World Cup match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:13:00">[36:13:00]</a>. As a batter, he is explosive and unorthodox, capable of clearing the boundary easily, and can even bat at number seven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:19:00">[35:19:00]</a>. He offers flexibility in bowling, able to bowl in any phase, including the power play or at the death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:25:00">[37:25:00]</a>.

### Trent Boult
Trent Boult is selected as a new ball bowler, specifically a left-arm seamer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:44:00">[38:44:00]</a>. Despite New Zealand's early exit from the T20 World Cup, his bowling in those games was "literally unplayable," with amazing returns and low runs conceded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:51:00">[38:51:00]</a>. He is known for getting the ball to hoop (swing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:09:00">[39:09:00]</a> and possesses experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:29:00">[39:29:00]</a>. Boult is considered an "absolute gun at getting a wicket in the first over," an incredible skill in T20 cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:11:00">[41:11:00]</a>.

### David Miller
David Miller's inclusion is justified by his current form, playing one of the best innings of the T20 World Cup on the tough New York pitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:02:00">[43:02:00]</a>. He is capable of staying in when the team is in trouble and adapting his game to tough conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:59:00">[42:59:00]</a>.

## Discussion on Player Inclusions/Exclusions

### Sunil Narine
Sunil Narine was considered but deemed ineligible as he has not made himself available for the West Indies national team despite his ludicrous IPL form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:50:00">[20:50:00]</a>.

### Glenn Maxwell
Glenn Maxwell, though a favorite player, was excluded due to his "appalling form," averaging seven in the IPL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:40:00">[21:40:00]</a>. He would have been a first pick a few months prior, given his 50-over World Cup performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:01:00">[22:01:00]</a>.

### Virat Kohli
Virat Kohli was acknowledged for his good IPL performance and exceptional fielding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:24:00">[44:24:00]</a>. However, his "atrocious" performance in the T20 World Cup, particularly scoring five runs in three games in New York, made it difficult to pick him ahead of the chosen top three batters (Head, Buttler, Sky) on current form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:27:00">[44:27:00]</a>.

### Wanindu Hasaranga
Wanindu Hasaranga was mentioned as a potential leg-spinner option, but his batting form in the T20 World Cup was poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:30:00">[41:30:00]</a>.

### Glenn Phillips
Glenn Phillips was a name considered for the 12th man, but David Miller's current form was deemed superior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:59:00">[46:59:00]</a>.

### Sikandar Raza
Sikandar Raza was considered as a good all-rounder option due to his off-spinning and batting contributions in recent years. However, his disadvantage was Zimbabwe not participating in the current T20 World Cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:11:00">[47:11:00]</a>.

### Mustafizur Rahman (Fizz)
Mustafizur Rahman was mentioned as a potential bowler pick due to his good form in the last couple of months, strong IPL performance, and ability to be difficult to score off on slow wickets due to his unique wrist action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:36:00">[49:36:00]</a>.

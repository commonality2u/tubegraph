## Overview of Pitch Conditions and Wickets

In recent Test matches, a high number of wickets have fallen, sometimes as many as 17 in a day, on pitches that appear suitable for batting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">00:00:01</a>. This phenomenon isn't attributed to traditional factors like seaming, swinging, unusual bounce, or specific spin direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">00:00:36</a>. Instead, it's often described as a "random pattern of wickets" where players get out in their own unique ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">00:00:43</a>. A recurring pattern sees batters coming to the crease, having a brief look, and then quickly departing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">00:00:52</a>.

The conditions can be characterized by a "new ball wicket" or "hard ball wicket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">00:01:04</a>. For instance, in one match, Bangladesh lost too many early wickets, preventing the ball from softening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">00:01:13</a>. Batting in India often becomes easier around the 40-over mark, when the ball starts to soften <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">00:09:00</a>. The period between 20 and 40 overs is crucial for batting in India, as the SG ball reacts differently in that phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">00:10:14</a>. Success depends on navigating this period; runs are available if a team can get through it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">00:10:35</a>.

### Jasprit Bumrah's Exceptional Performance

Jasprit Bumrah demonstrates remarkable versatility, being a "completely different bowler in the West" compared to playing at home in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">00:20:07</a>. This highlights his "ability to evolve and adapt within a situation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">00:20:19</a>.

*   **Home vs. Away**: At home, Bumrah is not considered a great new-ball bowler in India, possibly due to the SG ball favoring conventional swing bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">00:20:27</a>. However, with the old ball, especially in other parts of the world, he averages 18.7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">00:21:08</a>. This skill with the old ball may stem from his background in tape-ball and rubber-ball cricket, where players learn to manipulate the ball differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">00:21:12</a>.
*   **Wicket-Taking Ability**: In India, from overs 21 to 40, when conditions are hard for batting, Bumrah is at his best manipulating the old SG ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">00:22:21</a>. He takes many wickets during this phase and often bowls to the tail-enders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">00:22:11</a>.
*   **Statistical Dominance**: Bumrah's Test average is 20.4 after 30 Tests, which is significantly better than other Indian fast bowlers like Kapil Dev and Mohammed Shami at the same stage of their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">00:14:41</a>. His bowling average of 20.5 is among the best in Test cricket for bowlers with a minimum of 150 wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">00:16:01</a>. His unique bowling action allows him to gain an extra 50 centimeters over a standard bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">00:18:58</a>. He's likened to a combination of Malinga and Vernon Philander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">00:19:10</a>.
*   **Strategy**: Bumrah consistently hits specific areas, especially targeting the top of off stump to batters like Travis Head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">00:24:49</a>. He also has clear plans for bowling to both right-handers and left-handers, even with bouncers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">00:26:14</a>.

### Other Indian Bowlers

*   **Mohammed Siraj and Akash Deep**: Their performances, especially in the second and third seam spots, are "incredibly important" given Mohammed Shami's injury history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">00:13:16</a>. Siraj demonstrates clear plans when bowling to left-handers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">00:26:37</a>.
*   **Spinners - Ashwin and Jadeja**: They have "mastered the ability of just like not playing shots until the opposition tries anything" and putting pressure back on when they realize it's not in their favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">00:11:32</a>. Ashwin often experiments with fuller and wider lines against right-handers, while Jadeja maintains consistent length around off stump against right-handers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">00:27:22</a>. Jadeja's natural advantage against right-handers allows him to consistently land the ball in an optimal area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">00:27:54</a>. Ashwin also shows a beautiful split in pace, slowing down when needed and going up, which is crucial for a spinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">00:31:13</a>. Jadeja bowls with a more metronomic pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">00:31:30</a>.

### Bangladeshi Bowlers

*   **Hassan Mahmud**: He shows a "real pattern" and is an accurate bowler when bowling to right-handers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:3:22">00:3:22</a>. However, against left-handers, he seems unsure of his strategy and struggles to consistently hit a spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">00:03:33</a>.
*   **Taskin Ahmed**: While his lengths can be "spasmodic," he has a clear line for right-handers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">00:03:51</a>. Against left-handers, his plan is unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">00:03:59</a>.
*   **Mahedi Hasan**: As an off-spinner, he is more effective against left-handers, consistently landing the ball in the desired area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">00:04:40</a>. He is less sure when bowling to right-handers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">00:04:57</a>. His high control percentage when batting later in the innings is due to the ball softening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">00:12:42</a>.
*   **Shakib Al Hasan**: He has struggled with line and length in the current series, which is a concern for Bangladesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">00:05:14</a>.

### Batting Performances

*   **Indian Batters**: Rishabh Pant, Yashasvi Jaiswal, and K.R. played crucial innings by ensuring no further wickets fell during a critical period, allowing the ball to soften <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">00:08:20</a>. This partnership was key to India's innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">00:10:07</a>.
*   **Bangladesh Batters**: The majority of their runs came from the middle order, especially as the ball softened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">00:10:52</a>. However, no one in the top or middle order could stay in long enough to capitalize on the softer ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">00:10:58</a>.
*   **Virat Kohli**: His perceived struggles against Bangladesh in Tests are likely an anomaly, possibly linked to playing on slow pitches in Bangladesh, as his record against them in India is strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:34">00:56:34</a>. He prefers the ball coming onto the bat more quickly, which is why he excels in Australia and South Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:04">00:57:04</a>.
*   **Shubman Gill**: He has a known weakness against fuller balls coming into the stumps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">00:46:00</a>. Professional batters, like Gill, learn to minimize their flaws, often by attacking when bowlers miss their marks, turning potential weaknesses into strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:17">00:47:17</a>.
*   **Travis Head**: His strength is attacking deliveries slightly off target, either too straight or too wide of off stump, which can make it hard for bowlers to maintain consistent pressure despite knowing his weakness (top of off stump) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:43">00:48:43</a>. His ability to score quickly is transformative for a team, but it comes with inherent risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">01:05:01</a>.

### Understanding Batters' Awareness

It's a common belief among cricketers that batters always know when they've edged the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:33">00:36:33</a>. However, technology like DRS has shown numerous instances where top-level international players were convinced they hadn't hit the ball, only for replays to prove otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">00:37:01</a>. This suggests batters "don't always know when they've hit it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:59">00:37:59</a>, possibly due to factors like the density of modern bats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">00:38:37</a>.

### [[cricketing_roles_and_player_performance_assessment | Cricketing Roles and Player Performance Assessment]]

The discussion around [[player_performance_analysis_in_test_cricket | player performance analysis in Test cricket]] often goes beyond just overall averages. Factors like "match factor" (pitch conditions, batting position) and performance against different types of teams are considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:11">00:41:11</a>. For example, a player's average can be tanked by a few bad years at the end of a career, as seen with Gordon Greenidge or Ricky Ponting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">00:40:42</a>.

The role of a player like Ravindra Jadeja, who is excellent at blocking good balls and attacking bad ones when the ball is soft, is best suited for middle-to-lower order positions (e.g., number six or seven) rather than higher up (e.g., number three or four) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">00:52:51</a>. Pushing him higher would expose him to the harder new ball, which does not suit his current skillset, potentially reducing his batting average significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:03">00:55:03</a>. While there might be specific match situations to use a player like Jadeja or Chris Woakes up the order as "pinch blockers," it's not a permanent solution for their role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">00:54:47</a>.

## [[impact_of_limited_test_matches_on_player_selection | Player Potential]]

The Indian team faces selection dilemmas, particularly regarding spinners for overseas tours like Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:36">00:49:36</a>. While Ravindra Jadeja is considered an "automatic selection" due to his batting prowess, the choice between Ashwin, Kuldeep, and Axar Patel for the second spinner slot is complex, as all have valid claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:41">00:50:41</a>. The concern over the fifth bowler is often overstated, as the main three or four bowlers typically do most of the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:09">00:52:09</a>.

The potential of young batters like Shubman Gill and Travis Head, who are currently considered "S-level batters" and could become "worldwide greats," is high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:14">01:02:14</a>. Their development hinges on their ability to understand and overcome their individual weaknesses, similar to how Travis Head evolved after initially struggling against specific bowling strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:47">01:02:47</a>.

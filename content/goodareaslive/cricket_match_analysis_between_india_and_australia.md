This article provides an [[cricket_analysis_and_commentary_on_the_match | analysis]] of a cricket match between India and Australia, which served as a "perfect spar before a final" for India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:48">[01:40:48]</a>. Australia did not have enough "weapons" to compete with India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:09">[01:42:09]</a>. Despite not being at their best, India won because Australia was not a "great team" in this particular match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:39">[00:58:39]</a>. Australia's key players — Head, Maxwell, Dores, and Zampa — did not perform as needed for a win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:17">[00:46:17]</a>.

## Match Overview

India's strategy involved ensuring their bowlers didn't lose control, dropping a "socially acceptable amount of catches," and rotating the strike in a comfortable chase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:47">[01:09:47]</a>. India anticipated losing about four to seven wickets in the chase, which is where they ultimately ended up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:17">[01:30:17]</a>. Australia was a "very, very flawed" side, and India, even without Jasprit Bumrah, was significantly better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:37">[02:15:37]</a>. This match highlighted India's superior capabilities, regardless of the playing conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:48">[02:08:48]</a>.

## Player Performance Analysis

### Virat Kohli
Virat Kohli is considered the best chaser in ODI history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:08">[03:13:08]</a>. The pitch and bowling attack were "perfectly set up" for Kohli to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:26">[04:00:26]</a>. He scored well in the mid-wicket area and Australia struggled to keep him off strike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:03">[04:34:03]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Scoring Analysis
> Kohli's strike rate against spin was around 90, suggesting he played more defensively against pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:43">[05:29:43]</a>. His dot ball percentage was 33%, which is considered "really, really high" for ODI cricket, especially in a chase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:30">[05:51:30]</a>. He didn't get many runs from twos, possibly avoiding risky run-outs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:05">[06:07:05]</a>. Kohli's ability to hit sixes noticeably jumps up in a chase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:20">[06:36:20]</a>. He is generally better at hitting boundaries in a chase compared to the first innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:13">[07:12:13]</a>.

### Steve Smith
Australia struggled when Travis Head was out, leading to them getting "stuck" and losing wickets when trying to attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:15">[07:49:15]</a>. Smith's innings was characterized by hitting the ball often to long-on, which is unusual for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:16">[08:28:16]</a>. He played "forced shots" to get boundaries when he wasn't batting as he wanted, often getting stuck before playing risky shots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:46">[08:49:46]</a>. Smith doesn't score much straight down the ground, unlike players such as Shubman Gill or Mitchell Marsh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:19">[09:04:19]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Scoring Analysis
> Smith was "too slow for too long," putting pressure on the non-striker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:04">[09:33:04]</a>. His strike rate was slow against pace bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:05">[10:21:05]</a>. However, he batted "cleverly" against Kuldeep Yadav, preventing him from settling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:27">[10:46:27]</a>. Despite this, he couldn't get runs off other bowlers like Ravindra Jadeja or Axar Patel, making him "so slow" against them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:38">[11:12:38]</a>. Smith is generally "brilliant" at manipulating the field against spin, with 133% better singles and 35% better twos and threes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:08">[11:43:08]</a>. He has struggled to score at a good rate against quick bowlers in the last couple of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:30">[12:13:30]</a>.

Smith's ODI career has been "interesting," as he is often forgotten compared to other Australian greats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:38:09">[12:38:09]</a>. While not among the "frontline players" like Mark Waugh or Adam Gilchrist, he is in a respectable class of Australian batsmen with over 3,000 ODI runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:06">[12:50:06]</a>.

### Alex Carey
Alex Carey's recent performance in ODI cricket has been "very good," with him being an "active" player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:58">[13:46:58]</a>. He understood the need to increase the scoring rate, especially with Smith's slow batting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:09">[14:17:09]</a>. Carey's batting is heavily dependent on deep mid-wicket, and he frequently uses sweeps and reverse sweeps to access this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:07">[14:31:07]</a>. He delivered a "really good innings" that Australia needed at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:05">[14:55:05]</a>. Against spin, he's primarily a boundary hitter, and against pace, he's a strike manipulator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:18:23">[15:18:23]</a>. He is described as a "busy player" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:39:46">[15:39:46]</a>.

### Travis Head
India adopted an interesting strategy with Travis Head, bringing Kuldeep Yadav on early in the power play, a rare occurrence for Kuldeep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:59:10">[15:59:10]</a>. This tactic was likely due to Head's potential weakness against balls spinning away from him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:49:15">[16:49:15]</a>. Kuldeep's ability to bowl effectively in the power play and through the death overs showcases his "incredible flexibility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:15:06">[17:15:06]</a>.

### India's Batting Depth
India's batting lineup is incredibly talented. Shubman Gill is poised to be "one of the best that has ever done it" if ODI cricket continues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:44:03">[17:44:03]</a>. The lineup includes Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, Ravindra Jadeja, and KL Rahul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:23">[18:00:23]</a>. KL Rahul's "Zulu numbers" are slightly better than Sourav Ganguly's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:14:26">[18:14:26]</a>.

### Shreyas Iyer
Shreyas Iyer has a "well-rounded" scoring map, hitting pretty much everywhere on the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:30:19">[18:30:19]</a>. He is currently "so automatic" that he is unlikely to be dismissed for less than 35 runs unless India loses early wickets, he gets run out, or a fluke occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:55:03">[18:55:03]</a>. Iyer's unique technique against spinner Cooper Connelly, involving "kicking his back foot out like a drunken mule," was designed to confuse the bowler and prevent him from consistently landing the ball on the spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:14:04">[19:14:04]</a>. This shows his high-level technical skills and tactical thinking against spin bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:24:34">[19:24:34]</a>.

### KL Rahul
KL Rahul is a "professional" who knows what to do in various situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:40:24">[23:40:24]</a>. He is considered an "ideal batter to come in at that stage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:47:19">[23:47:19]</a>. While his technique is "limited," his scoring rate suggests he might be underestimated, as he takes many risks and is a very busy player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:21:04">[24:21:04]</a>. He plays like a "90s wicket-keeper" but slightly better, constantly looking for ways to score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:47:33">[24:47:33]</a>. He is not considered a particularly good player of spin, but is a "thorough professional" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:54:12">[24:54:12]</a>.

## Fielding and Bowling Analysis

Australia "couldn't afford to drop any catches" due to their lack of strike bowlers and lower score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:32:02">[20:32:02]</a>. They needed to take every chance in this kind of game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:35:36">[20:35:36]</a>.

Australia's bowling lineup, consisting of Dores and Zampa as the only genuine strike bowlers, lacked other options. Sangha is a T20 strike bowler but lacks a good ODI ratio, while Ellis, Maxwell, and Cooper Connelly are defensive bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:53:11">[20:53:11]</a>. Australia needed to score above par, which led to risks taken by players like Smith and regular wicket losses that ultimately cost them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:30:26">[21:30:26]</a>. An inexperienced bowling lineup meant India only had to wait for one mistake to capitalize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:57:31">[21:57:31]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Comparison of Bowling Lineups
> A full-strength Australian bowling lineup "might have defended this total," but this particular attack was not adequate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:12:47">[22:12:47]</a>. Australia was expected to struggle against a strong team like India throughout the tournament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:18:31">[22:18:31]</a>.

## Competitive Dynamics
The Australian team, despite missing an opening batter, still has a "pretty good batting lineup" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:28:44">[26:28:44]</a>. They have chased high totals previously, such as 350 against England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:53:16">[26:53:16]</a>. While they were missing a key element (strike bowling) in this match, their overall talent suggests it's not a "mentality thing" that hinders them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:54:57">[25:54:57]</a>.

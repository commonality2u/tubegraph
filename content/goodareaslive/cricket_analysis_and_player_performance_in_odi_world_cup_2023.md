This article provides an in-depth analysis of team and player performances during the [[Cricket World Cup 2023 analysis | 2023 Cricket World Cup]], focusing on the round-robin stage. The discussion covers team strategies, individual player statistics, and the evolving nature of cricket.

## Tournament Overview and India's Performance
The 2023 World Cup has demonstrated a high level of competition, with the depth of talent being greater than in previous tournaments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:55">[00:46:55]</a>. Notably, the [[Indian cricket team performance in CWC 2023 | Indian cricket team]] has maintained an undefeated record in the tournament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, lacking any obvious flaws compared to other strong teams like [[Australias cricket strategy and performance in ODI World Cup 2023 | Australia]] or South Africa, which had their own respective issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:46">[00:38:46]</a>.

### Indian Batting Performance
A significant point of discussion coming into the World Cup was [[Indian cricket teams challenges and strategies in ODI World Cup 2023 | India's number four batting position]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. In the 2019 World Cup, India's number fours averaged just under 25, which was remarkably low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. However, in the 2023 World Cup, this average improved significantly to almost 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, with a strike rate close to a run a ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. This improvement, attributed to players like Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul, has taken pressure off India's top three batters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

*   **KL Rahul (Number Five):** His role is considered a "hinge point," providing extra batting when needed and occasionally attacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. While not always making big scores, he has delivered under pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. His performances indicate he has played enough cricket and the ball is coming off his bat well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **Shreyas Iyer (Number Four):** After a slow start to the tournament, he has performed well, especially in the knockout stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. His ability to handle the short ball, a previous challenge, seems to be improving through continued exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:39">[00:50:39]</a>.

#### Virat Kohli's Batting and Bowling Analysis
Virat Kohli's batting technique against spin, specifically left-arm finger spin, has been a subject of analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. It is suggested that changes in pitch conditions favoring spinners in Test matches influenced his technique, leading to a diminished performance against left-arm finger spin across all formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. Historically, he was better at scoring against left-arm finger spin than off-spin, which is rare for a right-handed batter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. However, since early 2020, his average against left-arm finger spin in all international cricket has dropped significantly, while his performance against off-spin has remained relatively stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

Virat Kohli's part-time bowling is described as "weird" and unique, akin to a platypus of bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. He bowls leg-cutters by rolling his fingers over the top of the ball at a spinner's pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. His action involves bowling over the top of his head, causing the ball to drift down leg side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>. This unusual action, combined with the slow pace and drift, makes him difficult for batters to face as they lack prior experience with such peculiarities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. He is considered a "perfect eighth bowler" for situational use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>.

### Netherlands' Performance
The Netherlands team, despite facing stronger opponents like India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, demonstrated resilience in the tournament.

*   **Bowling:** Roelof van der Merwe is highlighted as a very clever defensive bowler who has adapted to keep economies down, despite not having the same "juice" in his action as he once did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>. He now serves best as a second spinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>. Bas de Leede and Logan van Beek, while having high economies due to being used out of position, have taken a "bucket of wickets" and "stood up so many times for Dutch Cricket" respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>. Bas de Leede now holds the record for most wickets by a Dutch player in a World Cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>, and the de Leede family contributes significantly to Dutch wickets in World Cups (18.1%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>.
*   **Batting:** The Netherlands had a surprisingly strong performance in the batting power play against India, achieving their second-best innings despite historically struggling in this phase throughout the tournament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:18">[00:30:18]</a>. Max O'Dowd and Colin Ackermann showed professional pride in scoring runs against top bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>.

## General [[Cricket statistics and player performances in World Cup 2023 | Cricket analysis and player performances in ODI World Cup 2023]]
The discussion also touched upon broader trends and specific aspects of cricket.

### Evolution of Batting
Modern batting emphasizes technique, strength, and new training methods, leading to more sixes being hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:46">[00:33:46]</a>. The T20 format and "Bazball" (referencing England's aggressive Test strategy) have influenced batters to think differently, leading to a broader range of players, including "nuggety" or "skinny guys," hitting big shots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>.

### Impact of Injuries
Injuries, such as Hardik Pandya's, can significantly alter team dynamics, as seen with Mohammed Shami's entry into the Indian team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:35">[00:36:35]</a>. Historical examples of "helpful injuries" in World Cups include Jason Gillespie and Brad Hogg in 2003, and Shane Warne's drug ban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:42">[00:36:42]</a>.

### The Decline of "Dibbly Dobblers"
The era of "dibbly dobbler" bowlers (slower, medium-pace part-timers) has largely faded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>. Teams realized these bowlers didn't provide a consistent advantage, and bowling speeds have significantly increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>. Modern-day "dibbly dobblers" like Marcus Stoinis bowl at higher speeds (80 mph) and must employ various tactics to be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:41">[00:45:41]</a>.

### [[Analysis of fielding and bowling strategies in ODI cricket during the World Cup 2023 | Fielding Analysis]]
Fielding is not an "easy" skill for all players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:57">[00:51:57]</a>. Some bowlers, particularly those who are "natural" bowlers or started playing organized cricket later in life, may struggle with fielding due to less developed all-around skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:11">[00:53:11]</a>. While bad fielders can be made "reasonable," natural talent plays a significant role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>. Bowlers generally spend more time in deep fielding positions, limiting their development in catching positions, which contributes to this disparity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:49">[00:56:49]</a>.

## Conclusion
The 2023 World Cup has been a highly competitive tournament, showcasing individual brilliance and tactical adaptations.

Pakistan's bowling and fielding efforts played a significant role in their surprising defeat to the USA in the World Cup, a game described as one of the biggest upsets in cricket history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:21">[02:18:21]</a>. Despite having a formidable pace attack, issues with consistency, fielding, and a lack of effective spin options contributed to their downfall.

## Initial Bowling Performance and USA's Start
When Pakistan began their bowling innings, they struggled to find their rhythm, sometimes appearing to chase wickets without a clear strategy for the pitch conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:11:47">[0:11:47]</a>. This allowed the USA to ease into their chase, scoring runs without needing to force the pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:12:09">[0:12:09]</a>. The USA batters, including Steven Taylor, faced Pakistan's key pacers like Shaheen Afridi, Mohammad Amir, and Naseem Shah and managed to get themselves set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:12:41">[0:12:41]</a>. While Naseem Shah did appear to change the momentum slightly, contributing to Pakistan fighting back and getting both openers out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:12:49">[0:12:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:14:09">[0:14:09]</a>, crucial moments still went the USA's way, such as an edge not carrying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:13:03">[0:13:03]</a>.

## Impact of Reverse Swing
The ball change in the middle of the innings proved to be a significant moment, as Pakistan's bowlers managed to get the ball to reverse almost instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:14:21">[0:14:21]</a>. While the reverse swing was more of a "gentle fade" than a violent movement, facing bowlers delivering at 85-90 mph with reverse swing created immense pressure for the USA batters, who were unaccustomed to such conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:14:47">[0:14:47]</a>. This allowed Pakistan's pacers to build pressure through dot balls and singles, bringing them back into a mathematically favorable position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:15:34">[0:15:34]</a>.

## Fielding and Wides: Key Detriments
Despite the bowlers' efforts to build pressure, Pakistan's fielding and excessive wides undermined their advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:15:04">[0:15:04]</a>. Pakistan bowled seven more wides than the USA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:15:11">[0:15:11]</a>. These extras, combined with fielding errors, allowed the USA to stay in the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:15:46">[0:15:46]</a>. A notable example was Shahid Afridi dropping Aaron Jones, who then went on to hit a six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:17:53">[0:17:53]</a>.

## Spin Bowling Weakness
A recurring [[challenges_faced_by_pakistans_bowling_attack | weakness]] for Pakistan over the past few World Cups has been their spin bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:16:47">[0:16:47]</a>. Shadab Khan bowled three overs for 27 runs, and Iftikhar Ahmed bowled one over for 10 runs, indicating they were not economical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:17:09">[0:17:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:17:12">[0:17:12]</a>. The absence of a consistently economical spinner like Imad Wasim might have been felt, as such a bowler could have helped lockdown parts of the game and increased pressure on the USA to take risks, potentially leading to more wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:17:17">[0:17:17]</a>. This limitation contributed to [[pakistans_bowling_challenges_in_the_world_cup | Pakistan's bowling challenges in the World Cup]].

## The Super Over Catastrophe
The Super Over highlighted significant issues in Pakistan's bowling and fielding execution. Mohammad Amir, tasked with bowling, struggled to nail his full and wide deliveries, resulting in wides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:22:52">[0:22:52]</a>. Mohammad Rizwan, the wicket-keeper, also struggled to collect these wide deliveries, leading to extra runs that were effectively "worth double" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:22:57">[0:22:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:23:01">[0:23:01]</a>. The umpire's calls on line-ball wides also seemed to go against Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:23:13">[0:23:13]</a>.

A "shambolic" moment occurred when Mohammad Rizwan attempted to throw the ball back to Mohammad Amir, but it went over Amir's head, resulting in an additional run because the USA batters were out of their crease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:23:33">[0:23:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:23:41">[0:23:41]</a>. This poor execution meant the USA scored 18 runs in the Super Over with only one boundary, mainly due to wides and misfields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:23:47">[0:23:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:24:02">[0:24:02]</a>.

## Comparison with USA's Super Over Performance
In contrast, USA's bowler, Saurabh Netravalkar, executed his plan better, keeping the ball on the right side of the wide line. Their captain and wicket-keeper, Monank Patel, cleanly took the balls, which was a significant difference compared to Rizwan's struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:25:08">[0:25:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:25:13">[0:25:13]</a>. Ultimately, Netravalkar's last ball was better executed than Haris Rauf's, demonstrating a crucial difference in composure and execution under pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:25:36">[0:25:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:25:53">[0:25:53]</a>. This highlights how Pakistan's [[pakistans_cricket_strategy_and_performance_issues | cricket strategy and performance issues]] were exposed.

## The "Anti-Quadrat Card Naim" Theory
The commentator introduces the "Quadrāt Card Naim" theory from Pakistani cricket, which suggests that things magically come together for Pakistan in World Cups regardless of their form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:26:50">[0:26:50]</a>. However, this match, particularly a strange incident in the Pakistan innings where two runs were taken off their total due to a complex rule about the ball being "dead," is posited as the "anti-Quadrāt Card Naim" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:28:15">[0:28:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:29:31">[0:29:31]</a>. The fact that the game was tied, and Pakistan effectively lost runs due to this obscure rule, combined with their Super Over mishaps, contributed to their defeat. This bizarre sequence of events, influenced by arcane cricket laws, potentially prevented a miraculous escape for Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:29:48">[0:29:48]</a>.

Overall, Pakistan's bowling and fielding, despite moments of brilliance, were marred by inconsistency, poor execution in crucial moments, and a lack of effective spin, ultimately costing them the match against an underdog USA team.

## [[role_of_mohammed_shami_in_indias_odi_strategy | Role in India's ODI Strategy]]

[[role_of_mohammed_shami_in_indias_odi_strategy | Muhammad Shami]] is a crucial part of India's bowling attack. His presence offers the option to "rip through the top orders" of opposing teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:54">[00:40:54]</a>. India's strategy often involves only two specialist seam bowlers, making [[role_of_bowlers_like_muhammad_shami_and_their_impact | Shami]]'s role even more vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. While there are discussions about other bowlers like Arshdeep Singh and Harshit Rana, [[role_of_bowlers_like_muhammad_shami_and_their_impact | Shami]]'s ability to take wickets, even if his economy rate is higher at the death, makes him a valuable asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. He fits the modern template of a strong, hit-the-wicket bowler who can generate inconsistency from the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.

Despite being injured often and [[bumrahs_performance_in_the_t20_world_cup | Bumrah]]'s prominence, [[muhammad_shamis_bowling_performance | Shami]]'s talent and record are often overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>.

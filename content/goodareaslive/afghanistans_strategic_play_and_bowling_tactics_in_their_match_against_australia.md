In their World Cup 2023 match against Australia, [[Afghanistans tactical decisions and execution in the World Cup | Afghanistan]] initially adopted a strategy of chipping the ball around during their batting innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. They managed to cash in towards the end, almost reaching a total of 300 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Bowling Strategy

[[Differences in cricket strategy between Afghanistan and England | Afghanistan's]] primary bowling strategy was to take as many wickets as possible with their spin bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. However, it was their quick bowlers who started exceptionally well, before the spinners became more involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Seam Bowling Performance

[[Australias team composition and match strategy | Afghanistan]] entered the match with an extra spin bowler, which placed additional pressure on their seamer Naveen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">[00:33:17]</a>. Despite this, Naveen delivered a "magnificent" ball to dismiss Travis Head, which angled in and tailed away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>. He followed this with a "double strike" by dismissing Mitch Marsh, showcasing his ability to create a difficult angle with the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:34:44]</a>. These early wickets were crucial for [[Afghanistans cricket performance in Champions Trophy | Afghanistan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>.

Omarzai, functioning as a backup seamer or all-rounder, showed promising raw talent with the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a>. He bowled a "really good ball" to David Warner that swung back in a long way with a late trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>. Omarzai also delivered a ball to Josh Inglis that hit the seam and moved away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>. As a "sixth bowling option" or second seamer, Omarzai possesses the ability to swing the ball at a decent pace, making him a "fantastically interesting cricketer" for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:25">[00:37:25]</a>.

### Spin Bowling and Fielding Challenges

While [[Australias cricket strategy and performance in ODI World Cup 2023 | Afghanistan's]] spin bowlers were anticipated to be key, the match highlighted some fielding deficiencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Glenn Maxwell was dropped multiple times, which allowed him to capitalize and build his innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. There was also a controversial DRS decision involving Maxwell that bounced over the stumps, which could have seen him walk off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Mujeeb Ur Rahman, positioned at backward short leg, was noted for dropping catches in that specific position, raising questions about fielder placement against players who frequently sweep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:38">[00:59:38]</a>.

## Captaincy and Game Management

Captain Hashmatullah Shahidi's tactical decisions came under scrutiny in hindsight, particularly regarding bowling changes as Maxwell's innings progressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a>. Despite the early wickets from the quicks, the commentary team believed that [[Australias performance and challenges in the World Cup 2023 match against Afghanistan | Afghanistan]] had a good chance of winning the game, which was primarily due to their early bowling performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:25">[00:40:25]</a>. However, the extraordinary nature of Glenn Maxwell's innings created immense pressure, leading to tactical errors and a "shell-shocked" response from the fielding side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:32">[00:47:32]</a>. It is argued that such rare and dominant individual performances often lead to the opposition making tactical errors due to the overwhelming pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:27">[00:55:27]</a>.

Ibrahim Zadran's century for [[Indias batting and bowling strategies | Afghanistan]] in the first innings was a significant achievement, marking the country's first World Cup century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:57">[00:40:57]</a>. His composed and "classy" innings provided the foundation that put [[Indias bowling strategies and performance | Afghanistan]] in a strong position to win the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:32">[00:39:32]</a>.

Ultimately, despite a strong start from their seamers and a notable batting performance from Zadran, [[Australias challenges and strategies in Test cricket | Afghanistan]] was unable to close out the match, primarily due to Maxwell's individual brilliance and their own fielding errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:21">[00:55:21]</a>.

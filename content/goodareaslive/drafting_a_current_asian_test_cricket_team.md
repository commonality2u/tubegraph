The Crick Picks podcast, in its 49th episode, featured hosts Baram Kazi (@De mango on Twitter), Estelle Vasu (@Estelle vasu the number one on Twitter), and Jared Kimber, undertaking the task of drafting a [[current_asian_test_cricket_team | current Asian Test cricket team]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. The challenge was to select a top five for a generic cricket category in a snake-style draft, specifically combining to draft a full team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. The key rule for this episode was that "current form really matters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

## Discussion and Reflections

The hosts noted several [[factors_influencing_current_test_cricket_outcomes | factors influencing current test cricket outcomes]] based on their draft:
*   **Indian Dominance**: Baram expressed concern about the number of Indians selected, noting he picked two in his first two picks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>, and later that there were four Indians and one Sri Lankan after a few rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>.
*   **Challenges in Top Order and Seam Bowling**: There was a perceived scarcity of [[top_asian_test_cricket_bowlers_and_batters | top-order players]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:47:00">[22:47:00]</a> and seam bowlers outside of India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:50:00">[22:50:00]</a>.
*   **Middle Order Strength Overlap**: Bangladesh's strength, particularly in the middle order, often overlaps with India's strengths, making [[selection_criteria_for_cricket_teams | selection]] difficult for other Asian nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:50:00">[22:50:00]</a>. This highlights [[challenges_in_selecting_current_test_players_from_different_nations | challenges in selecting current test players from different nations]] due to positional competition.
*   **Current Form vs. Overall Record**: The discussion around Shubman Gill and Ravichandran Ashwin highlighted the ambiguity of "current form," with Ashwin having just had a "worst ever series" but a man-of-the-match performance previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:45:00">[23:45:00]</a>.

The hosts invited listeners to share their own [[selection_criteria_for_cricket_teams | team selections]] and ideas for future Crick Picks episodes via Discord, Twitter, or YouTube comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:21:00">[24:21:00]</a>.

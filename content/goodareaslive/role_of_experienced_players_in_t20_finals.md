In the T20 World Cup 2024 final, the importance of experienced players was evident.

## Contrast and Resilience
While less experienced players like Axar Patel and Shivam Dube also contributed significantly in the final, their performances sometimes highlighted the need for more consistent boundary-hitting, which experienced players might provide under pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:39">[02:20:39]</a>. South Africa's struggle with their lower-order batting, particularly at the number seven and eight positions, exposed a weakness that experienced players in those roles could have mitigated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:32">[01:03:32]</a>.

Ultimately, India's victory demonstrated that while individual moments of brilliance from various players are important, the composure and strategic understanding brought by experienced players are invaluable in navigating the fine margins of a T20 World Cup final <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:26">[01:26:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:10">[01:31:10]</a>.

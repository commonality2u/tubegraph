[[Virat Kohli and his performance in ODI cricket | Virat Kohli]] is a prominent batter in ODI cricket, known for his strategic approach and record-breaking performances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

## Batting Strategy

In a recent match, [[Virat Kohli and his performance in ODI cricket | Kohli]] adopted an anchor role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. His approach to batting showed a unique pattern:
*   He started his innings "pretty quick," with his strike rate well over a run a ball in the first 10 overs, significantly ahead of his normal career strike rate at the beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.
*   He then slowed down considerably in the middle overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. This strategic slowdown was likely influenced by:
    *   His belief that a score of 280 would be more than sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>.
    *   The early cushion of runs provided by [[Rohit Sharmas impact and batting strategy | Rohit Sharma]] at the start of the innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>.
    *   The team's desire to avoid a collapse and ensure they reached the 35-over mark without losing too many wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.
    *   The opposition, South Africa, notoriously struggling with chases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a> and [[Indias bowling strategies and performance | India's world-class bowling attack]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>.
    *   The pitch becoming trickier and the ball starting to spin more as it got older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>, particularly suiting finger spinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

### Playing Against Spin
[[Virat Kohli and his performance in ODI cricket | Kohli's]] preference for playing against spin has evolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. He used to "love the ball spinning away" but no longer does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>. This change is attributed to adaptations in his technique when playing on more spin-friendly pitches in India, especially during Test matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>. Historically, he preferred to free his arms and play shots from mid-on to backward point, which is easier when the ball spins away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.

Against Keshav Maharaj, [[Virat Kohlis chasing record and techniques | Kohli]] was particularly cautious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. Databases suggest he attacked as little as 6% of the balls he faced from Maharaj <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>. In contrast, he was more aggressive against pace bowlers like Marco Jansen and Kagiso Rabada, and part-time spinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.

## Records and Milestones

### ODI Hundreds
[[Virat Kohli and his performance in ODI cricket | Kohli]] has achieved the feat of equaling the most hundreds of any player in One Day International (ODI) cricket history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>. It is widely expected that he will surpass Sachin Tendulkar's record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>.
*   **Comparison to Sachin Tendulkar**: [[Virat Kohli and his performance in ODI cricket | Kohli]] reached this milestone in 277 innings, significantly fewer than Tendulkar's 462 innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>. However, the game of cricket has evolved, with more hundreds being scored now due to players becoming much better at scoring fast without being dismissed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>. [[Virat Kohli and his performance in ODI cricket | Kohli]] can maintain a strike rate of 85-90 without taking significant risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>.

### World Cup Performances
[[Virat Kohli and his performance in ODI cricket | Kohli's]] performance in World Cups has shown a progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>:
*   **2011**: Batted at number four and was quite young <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>.
*   **2015**: Played in Australia and New Zealand, pitches he typically loves. Surprisingly, he did not convert into bigger scores despite it being a high-scoring tournament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:00">[11:50:00]</a>. This was considered his "peak" era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13:00]</a>.
*   **2019**: Did not convert starts into bigger scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>.
*   **Current World Cup**: He is on track to be the leading run-scorer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>, finally having a "mega World Cup" that aligns with his talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:00">[12:27:00]</a>.

## Addressing Criticisms and Slump

During a previous slump, theories about [[Virat Kohlis retirement and legacy | Kohli's]] performance included an unsubstantiated claim of "age fraud" or a natural decline in talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>. However, a more plausible explanation was that he was "overworked emotionally," focusing more on other things rather than just cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>. The impact of spin-friendly pitches in India on his Test cricket batting also played a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>.

Regarding his 49th hundred, some questioned whether his innings was "selfish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:15:00">[34:15:00]</a>. This perspective is largely dismissed when considering the context of the game:
*   The pitch became more difficult, and the ball started spinning more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:54:00">[34:54:00]</a>.
*   He was factoring in the strength of [[Indias batting and bowling strategies | India's bowling attack]] and the opposition's weakness in chasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:08:00">[35:08:00]</a>.
*   With Mohammad Shami batting at number eight, [[Strategic Insights on Test Cricket Batting | Kohli]] likely prioritized not losing more wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:32:00">[35:32:00]</a>.
*   His decision to play slower was not necessarily selfish, but a tactical choice to consolidate the innings and ensure a competitive total, especially with the ball softening and conditions changing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:55:00">[49:55:00]</a>.

## Overall Impact

[[Virat Kohlis chasing statistics and strategies | Kohli]] remains a crucial player, capable of influencing the game with his strategic batting and ability to adapt to game situations and pitch conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:17:00">[36:17:00]</a>.

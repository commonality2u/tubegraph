Pakistan's cricket team is currently experiencing what has been described as its "lowest ebb" in its storied history, characterized by consistent poor performance and a lack of mental and physical fortitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:55">[09:21:55]</a>. The team, once known for its mercurial and galvanizing nature, is now seen as consistently poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:39">[09:37:39]</a>.

## Performance Issues
Pakistan recently suffered a record-shattering loss to England in the Multan Test, losing by an innings and 47 runs after posting 556 in their first innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:07">[08:23:07]</a>. No team in 147 years of Test cricket had ever lost by an innings after scoring 500+ runs in their first innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:01">[08:27:01]</a>.

The team is on an 11-match winless streak at home in Test matches, their worst-ever home streak, which includes four draws and seven losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:07">[08:39:07]</a>. Their last home Test win was against [[challenges_faced_by_south_africa_cricket_team | South Africa]] in February 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:34">[08:58:34]</a>. Shan Masood, as captain, has presided over six consecutive Test losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:35">[09:16:35]</a>.

### Batting Concerns
[[challenges_faced_by_pakistans_batting_lineup | Pakistan's batting lineup]] has shown significant issues. The team has become overly reliant on Babar Azam, and when he fails, the entire lineup tends to collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:15">[12:12:15]</a>. Babar Azam has gone 18 Test innings without a 50+ (or even 40+) score, which is unacceptable for a player of his caliber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:04">[11:37:04]</a>. His dismissals have been described as "really poor" and highlight technical issues he needs to address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:14:42">[18:14:42]</a>.

The team exhibited "tired shots" and appeared "mentally and physically toast" during the third innings against England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>. Despite scoring 556 in the first innings at 3.7 runs per over, they were out-batted by England, who scored 823 runs at 5.5 runs per over in similar time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:08:00">[43:08:00]</a>. Surprisingly, Pakistan hit more sixes (11) than England (5) despite their lower overall score and slower run rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:32:00">[44:32:00]</a>.

Notable individual batting performances and collapses include:
*   **Abdullah Shafique:** Scored 102 in the first innings but was dismissed for a "lazy shot" on the first ball of the second innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:59:16">[15:59:16]</a>.
*   **Saud Shakeel:** Scored 4 and 25, with one dismissal called the "worst shot" in a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:18:00">[16:18:00]</a>. He got out to spin twice, despite being considered excellent against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:57:00">[19:57:00]</a>.
*   **Shan Masood:** Scored 151 in the first innings, playing a "ruthless" and "Bazball-like" innings at a strike rate of 85 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:20:00">[17:20:00]</a>. However, his second innings dismissal (11 runs) was "appalling," especially as captain, having been dropped twice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:45:00">[17:45:00]</a>.
*   **Mohammad Rizwan:** Scored 10 runs in two innings, including a duck, but is generally seen as a fighter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:03:00">[19:03:00]</a>.
*   **Salman Ali Agha:** Was the only player who "stood up," scoring an unbeaten 104 and 63 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:11:00">[19:11:00]</a>.
*   **Aamer Jamal:** Scored an unbeaten 55 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:23:00">[19:23:00]</a>.

Pakistan's third-innings collapses are a recurring issue, losing for 115 in Sydney after scoring 300+ in the first innings, and having two collapses against [[challenges_for_bangladeshs_cricket_team | Bangladesh]] (172 and 146) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:00">[14:43:00]</a>.

### Bowling Concerns
[[challenges_faced_by_pakistans_bowling_attack | Pakistan's bowling]] has also been a major contributor to their decline. They took only seven wickets in England's 150-over innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:02:59">[0:02:59]</a>, while England's Jack Leach alone took seven wickets in the match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:40">[04:29:40]</a>. In their 11 winless home Tests, Pakistan has averaged just over 12 wickets per game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:41">[01:14:41]</a>.

During the Multan Test, six Pakistani bowlers conceded more than 100 runs, leveling a record held by Zimbabwe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:47">[01:14:47]</a>.
*   **Tactical Flaws:** Captain Shan Masood was criticized for setting negative lines, with bowlers like Abrar Ahmed bowling outside leg stump to well-set batsmen like Harry Brook and Joe Root, making it impossible to take wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:50:00">[21:50:00]</a>. He also delayed taking the second new ball by 5.2 overs, despite no purchase from the old ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:23:00">[22:23:00]</a>.
*   **Workload Management:** Naseem Shah was over-bowled (31 overs) despite being injury-prone and England being close to declaring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:37:00">[22:37:00]</a>. This highlights a broader issue of poor workload management, which has impacted bowlers like Shaheen Shah Afridi, whose speeds are down and lateral movement is reduced due to being rushed back from injury and playing too much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:13:00">[26:13:00]</a>. Haris Rauf also broke down in a previous Test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:48:00">[26:48:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Spinners:** Pakistan has a serious "death of spinners" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:45:00">[37:45:00]</a>. Abrar Ahmed, once seen as a future leader of the spin attack, has been found out, injured frequently, and kept on the bench <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:37:00">[37:37:00]</a>. Other options like Nauman Ali and Zahid Mahmood are deemed insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>.

### Fielding Lapses
Both teams exhibited poor fielding, with nine dropped catches in the match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:57:00">[47:57:00]</a>. Pakistan had "very obvious" drops, including Babar Azam dropping Joe Root and Saud Shakeel dropping a chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:33:00">[46:33:00]</a>. Even the outfield conditions were poor, leading to increased fatigue for fielders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:54:00">[37:54:00]</a>.

## Pitch Conditions
Pakistan's strategy of preparing flat decks at home, particularly against England's "Bazball" approach, has backfired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:59:00">[29:59:00]</a>. The Multan pitch was described as a "terrible, terrible excuse of a cricket pitch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>. It remained "rock hard" like a day one pitch on day three, with no wear and tear or footmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:24:00">[31:24:00]</a>.

Despite initial reports of a "green top," experts knew it was impossible to produce one in Multan's blistering heat, and any initial "purchase" would quickly flatten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:37:00">[30:37:00]</a>. A surface where 450 runs are "under par" is considered "unfit for Test Cricket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:28:00">[32:28:20]</a>. This poor pitch preparation undermined their home advantage, unlike [[challenges_for_bangladeshs_cricket_team | Bangladesh]], who effectively use spin-friendly pitches in white-ball cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:48:00">[33:48:00]</a>. It appears Pakistan does not know what type of pitches suit them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:30:00">[34:30:00]</a>.

## Structural and Management Issues
The core problems for Pakistan cricket run deeper than just on-field performance, stemming from [[management_and_structural_issues_within_pakistan_cricket | administrative and structural issues]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:18:00">[23:18:00]</a>.
*   **Board Instability:** The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is characterized by volatility and instability, with frequent changes in leadership and a lack of continuity in domestic structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:22:00">[23:22:00]</a>. An example given is a player being "installed, sacked, and reinstalled as Captain without a game taking place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:09:00">[24:09:00]</a>.
*   **Incompetence and Mediocrity:** There is a "fair bit of mediocrity and incompetence at play" within the management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:27:00">[23:27:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Process:** The team lacks structured processes for injury management and workload management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:32:00">[23:32:00]</a>.
*   **Odd Appointments:** The appointment of a former umpire, Aleem Dar, as a selector has been questioned, as it is unprecedented in cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:20">[01:21:20]</a>.

These deep-rooted issues mean that a mere change in captaincy will not solve Pakistan's problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:08:00">[23:08:00]</a>. The challenges faced by Pakistan cricket are seen as a reflection of the country's economic and political turmoil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:00">[09:59:00]</a>.

## Opportunities and Potential Solutions
Despite the grim outlook, some areas for potential improvement or consideration were mentioned:
*   **Domestic Structure:** The domestic circuit in Pakistan is reportedly using the Dukes ball, which could potentially improve pacers' skills in different conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:45">[01:15:45]</a>.
*   **Learning from Opponents:** England's approach of consistently trying to take wickets, even in unfavorable conditions, by setting attacking fields and thinking tactically, offers a contrast to Pakistan's methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:34:00">[24:34:00]</a>.
*   **Pace Generation:** The team needs to prioritize managing the workloads of young, injury-prone pacers like Naseem Shah to prevent career-shortening injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:46">[01:17:46]</a>.
*   **Patience with Batsmen:** While some batsmen like Abdullah Shafique are "standard deviation kings" with high scores and terrible failures, this suggests potential that needs to be nurtured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:12">[01:14:12]</a>.
*   **Strategic Pitch Preparation:** Instead of flat decks, a "sticky surface" could potentially pose more challenges for an attacking team like England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:53:00">[30:53:00]</a>.
*   **Return of Test Cricket 'Flavor':** The hope exists that Pakistan cricket, alongside West Indian cricket, can regain its "flavor" that added much to Test cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:11">[01:11:11]</a>.

The current state of Pakistan cricket raises concerns about its relevance, with the team facing the brink of irrelevancy if it cannot consistently take 20 wickets in Test matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:49">[01:15:49]</a>.

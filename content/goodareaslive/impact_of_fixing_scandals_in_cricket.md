Cricket has been marred by numerous fixing scandals throughout its history, leading to severe consequences for individuals and the sport's reputation. These incidents involve players manipulating aspects of a game for financial gain, rather than to win, and often lead to bans, jail time, and a lasting stain on their careers and the game itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.

## Notable Fixing Scandals and Their Impact

### Salman Butt
Salman Butt, a former Pakistan Test captain, was involved in a major spot-fixing scandal at Lord's, where his fast bowlers delivered deliberate no-balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:43">[02:24:43]</a>. This occurred despite precedents set by match-fixing scandals in the 1990s and early 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. Butt served jail time for his involvement, which was described as a "biggest heartbreak" in cricket for some fans due to its off-field nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. He has never truly apologized for his actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a> and once asserted that cricket is "not that serious" and similar to wrestling where faking is allowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. The ICC was reportedly aware of his suspicious activities, including an "extraordinary number of phones," even before the scandal broke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

### Hansie Cronje
Hansie Cronje, former captain of South Africa, was found to have engaged in [[famous_matchfixing_cases_in_cricket_history | match-fixing]], allegedly for incentives like a leather jacket for his wife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>. His actions corrupted younger players and significantly tarnished the goodwill surrounding South African cricket's return to international play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>. Cronje's "unfortunate love of money" was apparent to many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>, and his willingness to force results in Test matches was seen as "grimy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>.

### Marlon Samuels
Marlon Samuels of the West Indies faced multiple bans for corruption. He was first banned for two years in 2008 for leaking information to an Indian bookie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:42:00">[14:42:00]</a>. After returning to win two T20 World Cups, he was banned again for six years recently for corruption in the T10 league in Abu Dhabi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:56:00">[14:56:00]</a>. This repeated offense effectively tarnished his legacy and image, as the previous ban had largely been forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:20:00">[15:20:00]</a>.

### Mohammad Asif
Mohammad Asif, a highly talented Pakistani bowler known for his unique skills like the wobble ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>, also had a tragic career marked by multiple controversies. Beyond his involvement in the spot-fixing scandal with Salman Butt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:00:00">[29:00:00]</a>, Asif was banned for nandrolone (a performance-enhancing drug) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:04:00">[29:04:00]</a> and was caught with opioids at Dubai airport, leading to a ban from playing in the UAE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:08:00">[29:08:00]</a>. He was also known to play club cricket high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:21:00">[29:21:00]</a>. His career is seen as a "tragedy" given his potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:40:00">[29:40:00]</a>.

### Lou Vincent
New Zealand's Lou Vincent was involved in significant fixing within the county cricket circuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:25:00">[31:25:00]</a>. Although there were earlier instances where he was caught with a bookie that were reportedly "brushed under the rug" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:15:00">[31:15:16]</a>, he eventually came clean, which was seen as an act of bravery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:30:00">[31:30:00]</a>. His involvement was particularly disappointing as New Zealand is often associated with the "Spirit of Cricket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:10:00">[32:10:00]</a>.

### Mohammad Azharuddin
Mohammad Azharuddin, a former Indian captain, was also implicated in [[famous_matchfixing_cases_in_cricket_history | match-fixing]] during the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:50:00">[33:50:00]</a>. Although his case was considered more complicated than some others, as it was not "100% proven" and his ban was later overturned, his career was effectively ruined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:02:00">[34:02:00]</a>. He had a reputation as a good guy and captain, making his lifetime ban particularly impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:09:00">[35:09:00]</a>.

### Shane Warne
Shane Warne, one of cricket's greatest players, faced controversies that affected his reputation. He was implicated in giving information to bookies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:25:00">[21:25:00]</a> and received a one-year suspension for using a masking agent, which is a drug offense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:14:00">[21:14:00]</a>. Despite these incidents, his overall public reputation often remains largely untarnished, frequently excused as "it's just Warney" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:35:00">[21:35:00]</a>.

> [!INFO] Other Individuals Mentioned in Fixing Scandals
> The podcast mentions a "long list of Pakistanis" involved in fixing, including Nazir Jamshed (described as a "mastermind" behind local fixing who served jail time) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:01:00">[31:01:00]</a>, Danish Kaneria (who fixed in county cricket) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:57:00">[30:57:00]</a>, Muhammad Amir, Shajil Khan, and Saleem Malik (who apologized 20 years later) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:42:00">[31:42:00]</a>. Wasim Akram is also mentioned in the context of the Qayyum Report, though the judge reportedly "liked Wasim Akram" and his involvement was not proven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:54:00">[35:54:00]</a>.

## Broader Impact
These scandals highlight a pattern of players putting money ahead of pride and ethical conduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>. The prevalence of fixing, particularly in the 1990s, suggests a widespread issue where "everyone was kind of doing it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:40:00">[35:40:00]</a>. The ICC has also been criticized for actions perceived as manipulating tournament structures, such as ensuring India and Pakistan are always in the same groups for commercial reasons, which is metaphorically described as "gerrymandering the leagues" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:14:00">[33:14:00]</a>.

The discussion differentiates fixing scandals from other forms of [[Crickets biggest cheats and scandals | cheating]] like [[Ball tampering incidents in cricket | ball tampering]] (e.g., Sandpapergate or Shahid Afridi biting the ball) or [[Controversial decisions and news in international cricket | fake catches]] (e.g., Rashid Latif) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>. While other forms of cheating involve manipulating the game on the field to gain a competitive advantage, fixing specifically involves manipulating outcomes for financial gain, directly undermining the integrity and competitive spirit of the sport.

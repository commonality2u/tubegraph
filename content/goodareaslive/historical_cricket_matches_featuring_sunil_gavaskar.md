A notable incident in [[analysis_of_historical_cricket_matches_and_records | historical cricket matches]] involves [[Sunil Gavaskars unusual batting technique | Sunil Gavaskar]] during a first-class knockout game between Mumbai and Karnataka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This particular match was a final <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>, played on a "ranked turner" pitch that was turning significantly by the fourth or fifth day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## An Unusual Batting Display

During the match, Raguram But, a renowned left-arm spinner for Karnataka who had also played one Test match for India, was bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Many Mumbai batters struggled against Raguramut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. According to an [[interesting_cricket_player_anecdotes_and_stories | anecdote]], Gavaskar, also known as Sunny, approached the struggling batters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. He advised them to "play with the spin" and offered to demonstrate how easy it was if they found it too difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

In a remarkable display of [[sunil_gavaskars_strategic_batting_decisions | strategic batting decisions]], Gavaskar went out to bat and faced Raguramut for six overs. What made this particularly unusual was that he batted left-handed on the turning pitch and survived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The story further details that Gavaskar had initially moved himself down the batting order, putting a left-handed player in ahead of him who did not last long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. He spent considerable time off the field discussing whether he should indeed bat left-handed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

Despite Mumbai having already lost the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>, Karnataka sought an outright win against Mumbai, reflecting the rivalry between the teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:08">[01:01:08]</a>. Even more remarkably, Gavaskar batted left-handed at one end of the pitch and then switched to batting right-handed at the other end, where an off-spinner was bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:16">[01:01:16]</a>.

Bowlers play a pivotal role in ICC tournaments, with their performance often determining a team's success or failure. The 2023 World Cup showcased how crucial bowling strategies and individual brilliance can be, from exploiting conditions to handling pressure.

## Pace Bowling Dominance

The World Cup highlighted the significance of pace bowlers, particularly those who can make an impact with both the new and old ball.

### Exploiting Conditions: Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood
Australia's [[impact_of_strategic_bowling_in_t20_cricket | Mitchell Starc]] and [[role_of_bowlers_like_muhammad_shami_and_their_impact | Josh Hazlewood]] delivered a "proper throwback bowling effort" in the semi-final against South Africa, reminiscent of their past World Cup performances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. The Kolkata clouds helped [[impact_of_strategic_bowling_in_t20_cricket | Starc]] swing the ball for an extended period, which he hadn't done for a while <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:40:00">[16:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47:00">[16:47:00]</a>. The ball remarkably stayed intact and swung for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>. [[impact_of_strategic_bowling_in_t20_cricket | Starc]]'s return to form gives Australia confidence, especially since they will need new ball wickets against India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:08:00">[17:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:17:00">[17:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:32:00">[17:32:00]</a>.

### India's Spearhead: Mohammed Shami
[[role_of_bowlers_like_muhammad_shami_and_their_impact | Mohammed Shami]] emerged as India's main strike force, taking 7 for 57 in the semi-final <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:17:00">[54:17:00]</a>. He secured 23 wickets in the World Cup at an average of 9, with a strike rate better than once every 11 deliveries, which is "insane" in World Cup history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:21:00">[54:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:23:00">[54:23:00]</a>. He also became the quickest to 54 World Cup wickets in 17 innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:31:00">[54:31:00]</a>. Initially on the bench, [[role_of_bowlers_like_muhammad_shami_and_their_impact | Shami]]'s inclusion came after Hardik Pandya's injury, enabling India to play a more attacking five-bowler strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:26:00">[56:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:51:00">[56:51:00]</a>. His success is partly attributed to [[role_of_bowlers_like_muhammad_shami_and_their_impact | Jasprit Bumrah]] building pressure, allowing [[role_of_bowlers_like_muhammad_shami_and_their_impact | Shami]] to be an even bigger strike force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:57:00">[58:57:00]</a>. [[role_of_bowlers_like_muhammad_shami_and_their_impact | Shami]]'s ability to get movement from the first change, even with slightly older balls, sets him apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:14:00">[58:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:30:00">[58:30:00]</a>. He is considered India's best-ever strike force in ODI cricket, boasting the best strike rate in ODI history for bowlers with a minimum of 120 wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:41:00">[54:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:51:00">[54:51:00]</a>.

### Breakthrough Talent: Gerald Coetzee
Gerald Coetzee was a standout "breakout star" in the World Cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>. He was one of four bowlers to take 20 wickets, with his bowling average of 19.8 being the best among non-Indian bowlers, and his strike rate second only to [[role_of_bowlers_like_muhammad_shami_and_their_impact | Mohammed Shami]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:16:00">[19:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:25:00">[19:25:00]</a>. His performance filled a void left by Anrich Nortje's injury and form issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:41:00">[19:41:00]</a>. Coetzee bowls fast, hits the middle of the pitch, and instills fear in batters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:05:00">[20:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:07:00">[20:07:00]</a>. He demonstrated a mix of short deliveries and Yorkers, setting up batters effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:26:00">[22:26:00]</a>.

## Spin Bowling's Strategic Role

Spinners also played a crucial strategic role, sometimes unexpectedly.

### Unexpected Spin: Travis Head
[[Role and Impact of Part Time Bowlers in Cricket | Travis Head]], primarily a batter, delivered a "double-head strike" that was unexpected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>. His spin angle was surprisingly greater than that of [[role_of_bowlers_like_muhammad_shami_and_their_impact | Adam Zampa]] and [[impact_of_strategic_bowling_in_t20_cricket | Glenn Maxwell]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.

### Rising Spin Talent: Keshav Maharaj and Kuldeep Yadav
[[Role of bowlers in recent T20 matches | Keshav Maharaj]] of South Africa impressed throughout the tournament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:42:00">[22:42:00]</a>. His success was comparable to [[Role of bowlers in recent T20 matches | Kuldeep Yadav]] of India, with almost identical numbers in the World Cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:47:00">[22:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:52:00">[22:52:00]</a>. [[Role of bowlers in recent T20 matches | Kuldeep]] slightly edged [[Role of bowlers in recent T20 matches | Maharaj]] on average (24.something), while [[Role of bowlers in recent T20 matches | Maharaj]] had a better economy rate (both around four) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:55:00">[22:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:03:00">[23:03:00]</a>. [[Role of bowlers in recent T20 matches | Kuldeep]] beats [[Role of bowlers in recent T20 matches | Maharaj]] in strike rate by about one point (34 vs. 35) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:06:00">[23:06:00]</a>. [[Role of bowlers in recent T20 matches | Maharaj]] has made a remarkable transition from a red-ball specialist to a successful white-ball bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:26:00">[23:26:00]</a>.

The discussion also touched on the nuances of spin bowling:
*   Wrist spinners (like [[Role of bowlers in recent T20 matches | Kuldeep Yadav]]) generally have an advantage over finger spinners as they impart more "over spin" on the ball, causing it to drop quicker and bounce higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:50:00">[52:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:00:00">[53:00:00]</a>.
*   The scarcity of left-arm wrist spinners (less than 1% of professional deliveries) makes them inherently harder for batters to face due to unfamiliar angles and different hand positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:56:00">[50:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:44:00">[51:44:00]</a>.

## Team Bowling Strategies

Teams adopted diverse bowling strategies, adapting to match situations and conditions.

### Australia's Aggressive Approach
Australia maintained an aggressive bowling approach early in the South Africa semi-final, with [[impact_of_strategic_bowling_in_t20_cricket | Starc]] and [[role_of_bowlers_like_muhammad_shami_and_their_impact | Hazlewood]] bowling long spells to go for the kill, unlike other teams that might have changed tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>.

### India's Flexible Bowling Unit
India's decision to play three quicks (Bumrah, Siraj, Shami) in their home conditions, where teams usually favor three spinners, showed a brave and effective strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:15:00">[56:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:19:00">[56:19:00]</a>. This paid off, creating high pressure and allowing their main strike bowlers to thrive.

### South Africa's Mid-Innings Struggles
South Africa's reliance on [[role_of_bowlers_in_recent_t20_matches | Marco Jansen]] for early wickets proved unsustainable, as he experienced "regression to mean" in later games, showing weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>. The team's overall bowling was good, but they missed an option like Anrich Nortje to pull things back and offer variety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:35:00">[21:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:41:00">[21:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:47:00">[21:47:00]</a>. The decision to bring in [[Role and Impact of Part Time Bowlers in Cricket | Aiden Markram]] to bowl in the powerplay, while unconventional, worked in taking a key wicket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:43:00">[24:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:10:00">[25:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:40:00">[25:40:00]</a>.

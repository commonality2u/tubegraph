Day 2 of the 1st Test between India and England saw India score very easily for much of the day, though they did cough up wickets unexpectedly at times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. England, despite taking an early wicket, ended the day "flapping like a fish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. India exceeded the par score of 400 quite easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## England's Bowling Performance

England's bowling on Day 2 was criticized as if the concept was new to them, with confusion between full tossers and half-trackers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. They also had no reviews left, making it impossible to rectify decisions that went against them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Their day was described as "medium terrible" primarily because India kept giving them wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

The percentage of spin long hops bowled by England was around 3.5%, compared to India's just under 2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>. England bowled 18 full tosses with their spinners, while India bowled six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. Regarding short balls, England bowled 22, compared to India's two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>. India bowled on a good length almost 70% of the time, whereas England hovered around 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>. This indicates England struggled significantly with their lengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>.

### Joe Root's Bowling

Joe Root started the bowling for England on Day 2 and took a wicket almost immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. This was the second-most overs he has ever bowled in a Test innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>. He looked the most threatening and in control among England's bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>. Root bowls well against left-handers, averaging over 60 against right-handers generally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. In Asia, his performance against right-handers improves significantly, and he's even better against left-handers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.

### Jack Leach's Performance

Jack Leach, who hadn't played for seven months, bowled like someone who hadn't played in seven months, facing hamstring, knee, and back problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. He never bowled more than a seven-over spell and had many short, sharp spells, despite having a good economy rate of 2.16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. Leach was accurate in a way other bowlers weren't, maintaining pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. He bowled the same amount of overs as Tom Hartley, about 20 overs short of what would be expected in a normal innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>. His best ball didn't look particularly good, and he didn't bowl any full tosses or short balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>.

### Mark Wood's Performance

Mark Wood had a good first spell, getting Indian batsmen hopping around, and KL Rahul seemed put off by his short ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>. He also achieved reverse swing later in the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:14">[00:31:14]</a>. England wanted a bowler who could occasionally bowl short and reverse the ball on this surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>.

## India's Batting and Dismissals

India scored very easily throughout the day but surprisingly lost wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Several Indian batsmen, including Shubman Gill, KL Rahul, Shreyas Iyer, and Yashasvi Jaiswal, gave away very big scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. Analysis of dismissals showed that India played a significant part in all of them, as none were from unplayable deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.

### Ravindra Jadeja's Batting

Ravindra Jadeja's batting was notable for its "rough gear changes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Before Tea:** His strike rate was 66, largely due to attacking left-arm finger spinners and capitalising on bad bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   **After Tea:** He focused on staying in when England improved their lines and lengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

Jadeja has evolved as a batter, moving from a young triple-centurion to a sloggy lower-order player, and is now considered a genuine number six, or even five, batsman for India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. His batting position at home since 2008 has primarily been at number six, though he batted at number four once and number five a couple of times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. He was formerly a handy number eight, but moving up the order to number six provides significant flexibility, allowing the team to include extra spinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

From 2013-2017, his home batting average was 32, which was sub-optimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. However, his average has improved to 57 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. While he has a good strike rate against left-arm finger spin, he is slower but hard to dismiss against off-spin and seam bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. On Day 2, he attacked early, putting England under pressure, then pulled back when England bowled better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

### Analysis of India's Wickets

*   **Rohit Sharma:** Dismissed trying to hit a short ball from Jack Leach straight up in the air, having come down the wicket prematurely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   **Yashasvi Jaiswal:** Caught out trying to put pressure on Joe Root, hitting the ball in an error that suggested his hand completely rotated, possibly after hitting the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Shubman Gill:** Flicked a full ball on his pads into the air to short mid-wicket, giving Tom Hartley his first wicket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. The ball was too close to him to attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
*   **Shreyas Iyer:** Dismissed trying to slog sweep a fine ball just outside off stump that came back onto the stumps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. He didn't get the desired connection on a half-tracker from Tom Hartley, spooning it to deep mid-wicket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   **KL Rahul:** Attempted to hit a half-tracker from Tom Hartley for a big shot, but found deep mid-wicket instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. He made several errors when Root bowled around the wicket, including an edge that went past the keeper and a leading edge to a ball outside leg stump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.
*   **KS Bharat:** Out sweeping to Joe Root. The off-spinner pitched in a good area and straightened to hit the stumps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Hawkeye indicated the ball was very low and barely going to hit the stumps after hitting his knee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
*   **Ravichandran Ashwin (run-out):** Ashwin pushed a ball on the offside and immediately looked for a run. He took off violently, but Jadeja was slow to get going, despite Ashwin making the call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Jadeja spent too much time looking at the fielder (Tom Hartley, a left-hander) rather than reacting to the call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. Jadeja then decided not to take the run, by which time Ashwin was halfway down the wicket. Ashwin would have easily made the single, but Jadeja was on his way back and got run out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. The irony was that Jadeja is often involved in run-outs due to his left-handedness, and here, a left-handed fielder caused the confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

## Pitch Conditions

The pitch was described as a "beautiful pitch" that kept everyone interested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>. It was considered an outstanding cricket wicket on Day 1, with good spin, pace, and bounce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>. On Day 2, it was a little slower, and the pace for seamers went out of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>. This type of pitch, which is not already cracked or dusty, doesn't necessarily get worse as sessions pass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:29">[00:41:29]</a>.

## England's Overrate

England's slow overrate was a significant issue on Day 2, as they were going at about 13 overs an hour early on and never caught up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:59">[00:29:59]</a>. This contributed to England losing 19 points due to slow overrate in the World Test Championship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:25">[00:29:25]</a>. Some observers noted that Western teams in Asia sometimes try to conserve energy, which can lead to flat performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:36">[00:30:36]</a>.

## Batting Order and Player Development

The discussion included the idea of adapting player roles based on conditions:
*   **Shubman Gill:** Has performed very well in Australia but not particularly well in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>. He struggles to rotate the strike in Test Cricket but is very good at it in ODI and T20 cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>. There is a suggestion to potentially move him down the order, similar to Virat Kohli's early career, to ease pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>.
*   **Shreyas Iyer:** Has been very good in Asian conditions but struggled when the ball moves laterally in seam bowling conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>.

The idea is to use players where their strengths lie while developing their weaknesses, similar to how bowlers are managed in different conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>. India's current batting order is considered a bit "wet" due to younger players who haven't yet proven themselves as much as experienced players like Cheteshwar Pujara or Ajinkya Rahane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>.

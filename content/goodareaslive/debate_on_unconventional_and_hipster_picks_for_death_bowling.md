In a recent episode of the CrickPiC podcast, a discussion revolved around drafting the top five bowlers to defend 10 runs in the final over of any cricket match. While some traditional, high-performing choices were made, the conversation also delved into "unconventional" and "hipster" picks, highlighting different approaches and player attributes valuable for high-pressure death bowling scenarios.

## Top Traditional Picks (Context)

The initial selections set a high bar for death bowling prowess:
*   **Jasprit Bumrah** was the unanimous first pick, praised as the best defensive bowler ever seen, capable of making 10 runs feel like "too many" to defend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>.
*   **Lasith Malinga** followed, recognized for his decorated history in [[bowler_performances_and_strategies | bowling death overs]], offering a full range of deliveries including slower balls, fast yorkers, and bouncers. His "peak" was even considered potentially better than Bumrah's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:01">[03:26:01]</a>.
*   **Wasim Akram** was the third pick, admired for his ability to bowl effectively at the death throughout his career, from his early quick pace to later deliveries bowled "off like five pacers." His skill in reversing the old ball made him a formidable choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:01">[04:53:01]</a>.

## Unconventional and Hipster Selections

The debate truly ignited with picks that challenged conventional wisdom or leaned on historical, often underestimated, performances.

### Chaminda Vaas
Estelle Vasudevan's choice of **Chaminda Vaas** was immediately tagged as an "unconventional" left-armer pick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:01">[07:11:01]</a>. Vaas was acknowledged for managing to defend difficult totals, notably defending 8 runs against Australia in the early 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:01">[07:45:01]</a>. He was described as "underestimated," possessing skills like reverse swing and effective yorkers, becoming more skillful with age even as his pace decreased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:01">[08:03:01]</a>.

### Spinners in Death Overs
The discussion then shifted to the rare inclusion of spinners for death overs, highlighting a significant "unconventional" approach.

*   **Rashid Khan** was the first spinner chosen, considered unique for his ability to bowl effectively in any phase of a T20 game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:01">[09:18:01]</a>. His confidence, difficulty to hit for boundaries, and high wicket-taking probability despite potentially wet conditions were cited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:01">[09:29:01]</a>.
*   **Saqlain Mushtaq** was described as a "hipster pick" from the 90s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:35:01">[22:35:01]</a>. He regularly bowled at the death for Pakistan in ODI cricket, and his *doosra* was virtually unreadable by batsmen of his era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:51:01">[22:51:01]</a>. His ability as an off-spinner to turn the ball both ways made him a significant threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:57:01">[23:57:01]</a>.
*   **Sunil Narine** was identified as another obvious, yet "unconventional," spinner for death overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:54:01">[24:54:01]</a>. An anecdote was shared about an analyst discovering that off-spinners at the death, particularly Narine, were incredibly difficult to hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:01:01">[25:01:01]</a>. Narine's ability to spin it both ways, combined with a knuckle ball, made him excellent at bowling for singles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:36:01">[25:36:01]</a>. His economy rates are notably low, often producing figures like 1/24 in T20s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:36:01">[26:36:01]</a>.

### Historical Pace Bowlers and Modern Specialists

*   **Joel Garner**, nicknamed "Big Bird," was highlighted for his almost unplayable economy rate, particularly in the 1979 World Cup final where he made it "just over" for England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:01">[11:42:01]</a>. He was considered a bowler batsmen would "block out" due to the impossibility of scoring off him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:01">[13:39:01]</a>. His economy rate in the last two overs of ODI games was 5.00 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:35:01">[41:35:01]</a>.
*   **Umar Gul** was selected as a "platinum death over bowler" from the early days of T20 cricket (late 2000s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:59:01">[14:59:01]</a>. He was known for bowling reverse swinging yorkers "at will" and being a significant wicket-taker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:17:01">[15:17:01]</a>.
*   **Dwayne Bravo** was chosen for his mastery of slow balls and variations, making him difficult to score off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:11:01">[17:11:01]</a>. Despite being considered "probably the worst bowler on this list by considerable margin," he was "the most likely to go" and bowl the final over, having made his career as a death bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:46:01">[17:46:01]</a>. He has bowled the last over in 62 T20 innings, with an economy of 8.4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:25:01">[32:25:01]</a>.
*   **Jess Jonassen**, a woman spinner, was deemed an "incredible" wicket-taking option at the death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:06:01">[19:06:01]</a>. She has bowled the second-most balls at the death by a woman, with a bowling average of 12 and an economy of 8 in the last two overs of T20s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:15:01">[20:15:01]</a>. Her low arm action and ability to consistently bowl yorkers as a spinner are unique strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:05:01">[21:05:01]</a>.
*   **Curtly Ambrose** ("Little Bird") was mentioned alongside Garner, suggested as being on a similar level as a death bowler despite West Indies' lack of World Cup wins during his era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:22:01">[27:22:01]</a>. His intimidating presence and perceived ability to limit batsmen to very few runs were emphasized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:29:01">[28:29:01]</a>.
*   **Chris Jordan** was a "customary Pakistan pick," chosen for his full death bowling skill set: deceptive pace (regularly clocking 145 km/h), killer slow ones, and accurate yorkers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:37:01">[29:37:01]</a>. Despite occasional expensive spells, he is seen as a game-winner at the death, with a T20 economy rate of 9.5 when bowling the 20th over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:15:01">[31:15:01]</a>.
*   **Alfonso Thomas** was cited as a "real hipster pick," an early T20 specialist death bowler, "a better version of Chris Jordan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:46:01">[36:46:01]</a>. He had an impressive economy rate of 7.43 bowling the 19th and 20th overs in the second innings of T20s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:32:01">[38:32:01]</a>.
*   **Jade Dernbach** was another "hipster pick" who, despite being "remembered as a bad bowler," had an economy of 7.51 when bowling the 19th and 20th overs in the second innings 34 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:51:01">[38:51:01]</a>.

### Overall Considerations
The discussion on [[attributes_of_successful_death_bowlers_in_cricket | successful death bowlers]] revealed a preference for [[bowler_performances_and_strategies | bowlers]] who not only contain runs but are also potent wicket-takers. The [[evolution_of_bowling_techniques_and_challenges_in_modern_cricket | challenges faced by unconventional bowlers]] like spinners in modern cricket, particularly with dew, were acknowledged but ultimately overcome by the unique skills of players like Rashid Khan and Sunil Narine. The panelists noted the difficulty in finding a large pool of consistently trustworthy death bowlers, with many top picks coming from eras before T20 cricket, where games less frequently came down to the final over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:54:01">[39:54:01]</a>.

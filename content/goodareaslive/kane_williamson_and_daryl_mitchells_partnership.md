In the World Cup semi-final, [[new_zealands_batting_performance_and_strategy | Kane Williamson]] and [[daryl_mitchells_batting_techniques_against_spin | Daryl Mitchell]] formed a crucial partnership for New Zealand against India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Despite India's strong start with the ball, their collaboration provided a significant challenge to the Indian bowling attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Match Context and Partnership Genesis
India, having won the toss, started aggressively, aiming to dominate New Zealand within the first 10 overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. New Zealand faced early pressure, with the ball moving more under lights at Wankhede <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Although India's new ball performance wasn't consistently strong, Mohammad Shami's wicket-taking prowess was evident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. It was after these early breakthroughs that Williamson and Mitchell came together at the crease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. India even dropped [[kane_williamsons_performance_against_south_africa | Kane Williamson]] at one point, offering New Zealand a lifeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Performance and Impact
The partnership was crucial in New Zealand's chase of India's formidable score. The commentators noted that there were moments during their stand when [[daryl_mitchells_batting_techniques_against_spin | Daryl Mitchell]], with Williamson at the other end, seemed capable of achieving the challenging target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This stand showcased the [[role_of_partnerships_in_cricket | role of partnerships in cricket]], providing stability and attacking intent in a high-pressure situation. Both teams had middle-order players capable of making runs, but New Zealand lacked a player who could apply the same kind of aggressive pressure that India's openers, particularly Rohit Sharma, did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

### Daryl Mitchell's Outstanding Effort
[[daryl_mitchells_batting_techniques_against_spin | Daryl Mitchell]] was lauded for his "absolutely outstanding" performance, playing until he was physically exhausted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>. Indian bowlers targeted him by bowling wide outside off stump, forcing him to over-hit the ball due to his fatigue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>. Mitchell is known for his strength hitting down the ground, a trait that very few players possess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a>. This tactic by India, though appearing unusual, aimed to counter his primary scoring zones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>. His consistency is remarkable, having scored over 1000 runs since his ODI debut in March 2021, often batting lower in the order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>. He's described as a "late blooming cricketer who knows his game has completely tailored it to how modern Cricket is played" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>. His adaptability, whether conquering Test Cricket, opening in a T20 World Cup, or bowling at the death, makes him a "fascinating cricketer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>.

### Kane Williamson's Resilient Return
[[kane_williamsons_performance_against_south_africa | Kane Williamson]] is regarded as a "folk hero in cricket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>. He made a miraculous return to the World Cup after an ACL tear, returning in six months instead of the typical nine to twelve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. Despite then suffering a broken thumb, he played with additional padding, leading to jokes about his Wolverine-like healing abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>. While his scoring rate was somewhat slower, putting pressure on Mitchell, he nevertheless "set his team up in a way that they at least had a chance of winning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>. At one point when he came to the crease, New Zealand's winning odds were 60 to 1, which he helped bring down to around 8 to 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>.

Ultimately, once Williamson was dismissed, the chase became significantly more difficult for New Zealand, with Mitchell left to continue largely on his own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

England secured a record-shattering victory against Pakistan in the Multan Test match, a performance that highlighted a significant shift in Test cricket strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. This win was particularly remarkable as England achieved it without key experienced bowlers like James Anderson, Ollie Robinson, and Mark Wood, and captain Ben Stokes was also absent from the match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. The team demonstrated an unprecedented ability to win Test matches even after conceding over 500 runs in the first innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.

## Match Context and England's Approach

England's previous tour of Pakistan saw them make a statement in Rawalpindi by scoring over 500 runs on Day 1, setting the tone for that series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. The strategy then was a very basic "whacking everything" approach that proved effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. This time in Multan, the statement was "far bigger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. The current England team, under the "Bazball" philosophy, appears unfazed if opponents score large totals, even 550 or more in the first innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. This fearless approach has been pivotal in their recent successes.

## England's Dominant Performance

### Batting Prowess
England posted a colossal 823 for 7 in 150 overs before declaring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:06:00">[43:06:00]</a>. This total stands as the fourth-highest in Test cricket history and the highest score in the 21st century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:03:00">[56:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:12:00">[56:12:00]</a>. Notably, England scored 267 more runs than Pakistan despite batting for almost the same number of overs (150 vs. Pakistan's 149) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:01:00">[43:01:00]</a>. Their innings, scoring at 5.5 runs per over, is an outlier on historical scatter plots of Test innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:35:00">[43:35:00]</a>. Despite their aggressive reputation, England hit only five sixes compared to Pakistan's eleven, indicating a focus on consistent scoring rather than just boundary-hitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:21:00">[44:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:51:00">[44:51:00]</a>. England's strategy also involved tiring out the Pakistani fielders by focusing on ones and twos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:20:00">[28:20:00]</a>.

### Key Batting Partnerships and Individual Records
The partnership between Joe Root and Harry Brook was particularly devastating, accumulating 454 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:21:00">[56:21:00]</a>. This stands as:
*   The fourth-largest partnership ever for any wicket in Test history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:26:00">[56:26:00]</a>.
*   The largest fourth-wicket partnership in Test history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:28:00">[56:28:00]</a>.
*   The largest partnership for England ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:31:00">[56:31:00]</a>.
*   The largest partnership Pakistan has ever conceded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:36:00">[56:36:00]</a>.

#### Joe Root's Milestones
Joe Root's phenomenal 262 runs marked his highest Test score in his career spanning over a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:11">[01:04:11]</a>. During this innings, he surpassed Alastair Cook to become England's highest-ever run-scorer in Test cricket and is now the fifth-highest run-scorer in the history of Test cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:19">[01:04:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:24">[01:04:24]</a>. He also completed 20,000 international runs for England and now has 35 Test centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:36">[01:04:36]</a>. Since 2021, Root has scored 18 centuries, which is more than the combined total of Steve Smith, Virat Kohli, and Kane Williamson (17) during the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:42">[01:04:42]</a>. His fitness and dedication are highlighted by him batting for 136 overs after fielding for 149 overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:46">[01:05:46]</a>. Root is considered arguably the greatest Test batter in contemporary cricket due to his mastery of Test match tempo and consistent strike rotation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:28">[01:07:28]</a>.

#### Harry Brook's Triple Century
Harry Brook, the Player of the Match, scored an unbeaten 317 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:08">[00:58:08]</a>, becoming the second player in history to score a triple century after their maiden double century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:13">[00:58:13]</a>. He is the sixth Englishman to achieve a triple century in Test cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:27">[00:58:27]</a>. Brook holds an incredible record in Pakistan, having scored a century in each of his last three innings there, and he is the non-Pakistani batter with the most centuries in Pakistan, achieving this in just six innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:39">[00:58:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:46">[00:58:46]</a>. His 317 surpassed Virender Sehwag's 309 as the highest score in Multan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:56">[00:58:56]</a>. Harry Brook's diverse shot-making ability, including charging down the track for sixes, tennis-forehand swats, and drives, positions him for potential greatness in Test cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:24">[00:59:24]</a>.

### Bowling Performance
Despite a seemingly inexperienced bowling attack, England managed to take 19 wickets for the win, which was enough because Pakistan's Abrar Ahmed was in the hospital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>. Jack Leach was a standout, taking seven wickets in the match (three in the first innings and four for 30 in the second), matching the total wickets taken by Pakistan's entire team in their second bowling innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. The English bowlers, despite lacking the experience of Anderson or the pace of Wood, focused on an attacking mindset and constantly sought wickets, a key difference from their opponents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:34:00">[24:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:07">[01:19:07]</a>.

## Pakistan's Struggles

Pakistan suffered a historic innings defeat, losing by an innings and 47 runs after posting 556 runs in their first innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>. This is the first time in 147 years of Test cricket that a team has lost by an innings after scoring over 500 in their first innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>. This defeat extended Pakistan's winless streak at home to 11 Test matches, their worst ever streak, with 7 losses and 4 draws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>. Their last home Test win was in February 2021 against South Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59:00">[08:59:00]</a>.

### Batting Collapse and Key Players
Pakistan's third innings saw a collective mental and physical collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>, scoring at an alarming rate of four runs an over on a pitch described as a "road" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:00">[13:18:00]</a>.
*   **Babar Azam:** Despite being considered a top batter, he is in a prolonged slump, having gone 18 Test innings without a 50-plus score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:07">[01:08:07]</a>. His dismissals often show technical issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:42">[01:18:42]</a>.
*   **Shan Masood (Captain):** Scored a brilliant 151 in the first innings at a high strike rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:30">[01:16:30]</a>. However, his second innings dismissal (caught while giving catching practice on 11) was heavily criticized, especially given his captaincy role and the need to save the match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:53">[01:17:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:58">[01:17:58]</a>.
*   **Abdullah Shafique:** Scored a century (102) in the first innings but was dismissed lazily on the first ball in the second innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:05">[01:16:05]</a>.
*   **Saud Shakeel:** Got out to spin twice, which is considered unacceptable for a batter supposedly excellent against spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:57">[01:18:57]</a>.
*   **Salman Agha:** Stood out with an unbeaten 104 and 63, showing resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:11">[01:19:11]</a>.
*   **Ahmed Jamal:** Scored an unbeaten 55, surprisingly leading the way when senior batters failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:23">[01:19:23]</a>.

### Bowling and Fielding Deficiencies
Pakistan's bowlers struggled significantly, taking only seven wickets in England's 150-over innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:15">[01:14:15]</a>. Six Pakistani bowlers conceded over 100 runs, a record they now share with Zimbabwe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:49">[01:14:49]</a>. The bowling strategy was criticized for negative lines, particularly bowling outside leg stump to well-set batters like Harry Brook and Joe Root, effectively not attempting to take wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:59">[02:19:59]</a>. Captain Shan Masood's decision-making, such as delaying the second new ball by 5.2 overs when the old ball offered no purchase, was also questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.

Pakistan's fielding was also poor, with several dropped catches, including two costly ones off Joe Root (by Babar Azam) and Saud Shakeel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:28:00">[46:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:43:00">[46:43:00]</a>.

### Pitch Controversy
The pitch at Multan was a major talking point. Despite initial reports of a green top, it was described as a "rock hard" highway or "autobahn" with no wear and tear even on Day 3, leading to dull cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">[01:13:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:39">[01:19:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:39">[01:31:39]</a>. Preparing such a flat deck against an aggressive English side was seen as a "death wish" and a significant planning error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:59">[01:11:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:10">[01:12:10]</a>. A Test match surface where 450 runs are considered "under par" is deemed unfit for Test cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:29">[01:13:29]</a>.

## Broader Implications for Pakistan Cricket

This defeat plunged Pakistan cricket into what is described as its "lowest ebb" in its storied history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>. Historically, Pakistan was known as a mercurial team capable of galvanizing and beating anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>. However, this team is now consistently poor, physically and mentally incapable of fighting back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>. The decline of Pakistan cricket is seen as paralleling the nation's economic and political turmoil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. The team lacks dependable Test batsmen and quality spinners that were hallmarks of past eras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:47">[01:10:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:54">[01:10:54]</a>.

The issues extend beyond individual performances to administrative volatility, incompetence within the board, lack of continuity in domestic structures, and poor injury/workload management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. The absence of a strong spin attack is a critical concern, with no clear replacements for currently struggling or injured spinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:10">[01:15:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:42">[01:17:42]</a>. The over-bowling of fast bowlers like Naseem Shah and Shaheen Afridi, who are injury-prone, further exacerbates the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

The win in Multan further solidified the impact of [[Englands Bowling Performance and Strategy | Bazball]] on Test cricket, demonstrating that teams can no longer solely play for a draw and must adopt a more attacking mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:56:00">[54:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:00:00">[55:00:00]</a>. The current state of Pakistan cricket, in contrast, suggests a team struggling to adapt to modern Test cricket demands and risks becoming irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:49">[01:15:49]</a>.

The rivalry between India and Pakistan in One Day International (ODI) World Cups is a highly anticipated fixture in the cricket world, often seen as "the mother of all games" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>. Tournament organizers often ensure these teams play at least once, with tournaments sometimes "rigged" for this fixture due to its broadcast appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>. As of October 2023, India holds an 8-0 unbeaten streak against Pakistan in ODI World Cups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>.

## Early World Cups: A Surprising Absence
Despite the current hype, India and Pakistan did not play each other in the first four editions of the ODI World Cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. This was unexpected, especially for the 1987 World Cup, which was co-hosted by India and Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. During this period, the International Cricket Council (ICC) was less developed, and match-rigging for big fixtures like [[India vs Pakistan match analysis|India vs Pakistan]] was not yet common practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.

At the time, Pakistan was considered the superior limited-overs side prior to 1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>. From the 1975 and 1979 World Cups, India's performance was notably poor, while Pakistan likely had more professional one-day cricketers due to their participation in Kerry Packer's World Series Cricket and County Cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>. Even in the 1983 and 1987 tournaments, which featured a round-robin format with teams playing twice, Pakistan would have had ample opportunities to secure wins against India, given they were generally the better team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:06]</a>.

## Key World Cup Encounters
While [[key_matches_between_india_and_pakistan_in_world_cup_history|key matches between India and Pakistan in World Cup history]] have generally favoured India, several stand out:

### 1992 World Cup (Sydney)
The first World Cup encounter between India and Pakistan occurred in 1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>. India batted first, scoring 217 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>. Pakistan, despite being a strong limited-overs outfit at the time and eventually winning the tournament, failed to chase down the target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>. This was considered a "dumb luck" win for India, as Pakistan was capable of chasing similar totals against stronger teams like New Zealand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>.

### 1996 World Cup (Bangalore)
A quarter-final match in Bangalore saw India set a formidable total of 287 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>. This total, equivalent to 350-360 in contemporary cricket, was largely boosted by Ajay Jadeja's quick runs towards the end of the innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>. Pakistan started aggressively, reaching 84 for no loss after 10 overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[00:10:00]</a>. However, the dismissal of Saeed Anwar and a controversial moment involving Aamer Sohail and Venkatesh Prasad led to a collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>. Prasad's dismissal of Sohail, following an exchange of words, became a memorable part of World Cup lore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>. Venkatesh Prasad continued to be a notable performer against Pakistan, taking a five-wicket haul in the 1999 World Cup match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:00">[11:33:00]</a>.

### 1999 World Cup (Old Trafford)
In 1999, India again batted first and scored 228, which Pakistan failed to chase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>. Similar to 1992, Pakistan was a strong ODI team but couldn't secure the win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>.

### 2003 World Cup (Centurion)
The 2003 World Cup match marked a significant [[evolution_of_india_and_pakistans_cricket_teams_over_the_years|change of guard]] in the [[comparative analysis of india and pakistan cricket teams|comparative analysis of India and Pakistan cricket teams]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:00">[12:15:00]</a>. Prior to this, Pakistan was generally considered the superior limited-overs side in World Cup cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>. From 2000 onwards, [[indias_dominance_in_odi_cricket|India's Dominance in ODI Cricket]] with its batting strength began to emerge, while Pakistan's batting started to decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>.

Pakistan's aging team, including Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis who were past their prime, played in this match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>. Sachin Tendulkar's 98-run innings, famously featuring a six over third man off Shoaib Akhtar, was a defining moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:30:00">[12:30:00]</a>. This victory at Centurion is seen as a turning point that "catapulted" Indian cricket towards future success, laying the "template of modern-day India" in terms of confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>. Pakistan, once rich in all-rounders, became a "shadow of the team they once used to be" by 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:37:00">[15:37:00]</a>.

### 2007 World Cup: No Encounter
Both India and Pakistan were knocked out early in the 2007 World Cup, failing to progress beyond the group stage. Pakistan lost to Ireland, and India was eliminated by Bangladesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:14:00">[16:14:00]</a>. This meant there was no match between the two rivals in this tournament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09:00">[16:09:00]</a>.

### 2011 World Cup (Mohali)
The semi-final in Mohali was arguably the most high-profile ODI World Cup match between the two teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:04:00">[19:04:00]</a>. Pakistan, despite losing key players to spot-fixing the previous year, made it to the semi-final <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:26:00">[17:26:00]</a>. The game was marked by Sachin Tendulkar being dropped four times, and a controversial DRS LBW decision that went in his favour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:40:00">[17:40:00]</a>. Despite India's 260-run target, Pakistan failed to chase it, intensifying discussions around "fixing PTSD" among fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:41:00">[18:41:00]</a>. Wahab Riaz's five-wicket haul was a highlight for Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:16:00">[19:16:00]</a>.

## Post-2011 Era and the "Hoodoo"
The pattern of India winning continued in 2015 and 2019, with India often scoring 300+ and Pakistan failing to cross 240 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:13:00">[21:13:00]</a>. Six of Pakistan's eight World Cup losses against India have come while chasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:09:00">[21:09:00]</a>.

### Pressure vs. Skill Disparity
The debate often revolves around whether Pakistan's losses are due to nerves and pressure, or a fundamental difference in team strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:27:00">[21:27:00]</a>. Some argue that the increased frequency of their encounters in the 1990s and early 2000s might have mitigated pressure, but since 2007, they play less often, increasing the stakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:51:00">[21:51:00]</a>.

*   **Skill Disparity:** It is suggested that India, being a stronger batting team, sets high totals, while Pakistan, primarily a bowling team, struggles to chase them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:28:00">[22:28:00]</a>. This disparity in batting lineups has been significant since 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:52:00">[22:52:00]</a>.
*   **Pressure:** The "nerves thing" is a common fan explanation, especially given Pakistan's track record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:27:00">[21:27:00]</a>. However, Pakistan has broken the "hoodoo" in T20 World Cups, winning in Dubai in 2021 by chasing successfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:07:00">[25:07:00]</a>. This complicates the pressure narrative, suggesting a combination of "dumb luck" and India's batting prowess in nullifying Pakistan's bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:33:00">[25:33:00]</a>.

### The Role of T20 World Cups
The 2007 T20 World Cup final between India and Pakistan was a significant moment, bringing the rivalry to a new level of media attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:34:00">[19:34:00]</a>. Pakistan's win over India in the 2021 T20 World Cup in Dubai marked their first World Cup victory against India in any format, ending a long-standing streak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:07:00">[25:07:00]</a>. However, India won the 2022 T20 World Cup encounter at the MCG due to an incredible innings by Virat Kohli, despite Pakistan being in a strong position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:30:00">[26:30:00]</a>.

## The Future of the Rivalry in ODIs
With discussions about the potential scrapping of the ODI World Cup, there's uncertainty if Pakistan will ever get the chance to break their unbeaten streak against India in the format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:28:00">[28:28:00]</a>. For long-time fans, especially those who remember the 1992 World Cup, this "negativity" could remain forever if the format diminishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:02:00">[29:02:00]</a>.

The rivalry is deeply ingrained in the culture of both nations, fueled by nationalism and political tensions, making it "more than a game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:55:00">[32:55:00]</a>. While the hype can sometimes be annoying, the way both countries consume and celebrate this fixture is unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:17:00">[34:17:00]</a>. Despite India's refusal to play bilateral series with Pakistan due to political reasons, there's a strong desire from the BCCI to play, driven by potential financial gains and national energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:52:00">[34:52:00]</a>.

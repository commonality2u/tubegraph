Glenn Maxwell has faced significant criticism regarding his performances in the Indian Premier League (IPL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Despite being recognized as an "incredible talent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, concerns have been raised about his approach and consistency within the tournament.

## Perceived Lack of Professionalism

A major point of contention is the perception that Maxwell treats the IPL as a "vacation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. There have been "terrible stories" alleging a severe "lack or the absence of professionalism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This issue is not unique to his IPL appearances, as concerns about his professionalism were also noted during his time in Australian cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. For some, his conduct in the IPL goes "beyond professionalism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Underperformance Despite High Earnings

There is widespread disbelief that a player of Maxwell's potential has "pulled the rug" over the IPL and its [[maxwells_impact_on_ipl_franchises | franchises]] for a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. He has reportedly earned "more than a million dollars almost every year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a> yet "hasn't come up to scratch or lived up to his potential" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a> during this period.

## General Sentiment and Reputation

Maxwell is not "the most liked individual in [[maxwells_reputation_in_indian_cricket | Indian cricket]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. It has been suggested that personal issues might influence public statements about him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. However, the criticism is not limited to specific individuals, as many observers feel they have "equal things to kind of say about Maxi" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

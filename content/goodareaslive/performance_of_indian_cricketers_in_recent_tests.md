The overthrows podcast discusses [[Indias performance and strategies in recent Test matches | India's dominant performance]] in sweeping Bangladesh 2-0 in the Test series at home, winning a match in Kanpur in practically two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Unwinnable Test Turned Around
India secured a remarkable victory in the Test match against Bangladesh, despite the odds being stacked against them. At the end of day three, Bangladesh's score stood at 107 for three wickets, with no play possible on the second and third days due to rain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. The match seemed unwinnable for India at the start of day four, yet they managed to secure the win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. This quick turnaround highlights how much [[Cricket and player performances | cricket]] has transformed, with one team demonstrating a willingness to score at an extraordinary rate of eight runs per over, even before their primary batting innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

## Displaying Killer Instinct and Aggression
Unlike older Indian teams, this squad, led by Rohit Sharma, showed a strong "killer instinct" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. After bowling out Bangladesh, India scored 50 runs in just three overs, setting a record for the fastest 50 in Test [[Cricket and player performances | cricket]] history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>. They continued to break records, achieving the fastest team 100, 150, 200, and 250 runs, playing with a "vengeance" that reinforces their status as the most dominant Test team of the current era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>.

India's approach was highly result-oriented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>, marking what feels like "the start of a new era" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>. They declared their innings with a lead of only 50-odd runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>, aiming to maximize time to bowl Bangladesh out twice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>. This strategy of declaring early to bowl during the last hour of the day is a traditional tactic, offering two opportunities with the new ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>. Bangladesh ultimately finished the day with a deficit of 26 runs and two wickets down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>.

## Player Performances

### Batting
Excluding Rishabh Pant and Ravindra Jadeja, all Indian batters in the top seven in the second innings of this Test struck at better than a run a ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>.

*   **Yashasvi Jaiswal:** The Player of the Match, Jaiswal, scored 72 off 51 balls in the first innings and 51 off 45 balls in the second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>. He has now amassed a 50-plus score in each of his last seven Tests, approaching the record of eight held by Kusal Mendis and Babar Azam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>. Jaiswal is considered a "prodigy for the ages" with his stock continually rising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:00">[11:04:00]</a>. He averaged 48 with the bat in the series, scoring three half-centuries in four innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a>. Expectations are high for his performance in the upcoming Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia on bouncy tracks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a>.
*   **KL Rahul:** Rahul scored a rapid 68 runs off 43 balls in India's first innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>. Despite public criticism, Rahul is valued by the team for his versatility, being able to bat in various positions, block when needed, bat normally, or go "absolutely ballistic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:37:00">[14:37:00]</a>. His performances in the series demonstrated this range, from a 12-run innings off 10 overs to this aggressive knock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:00">[15:05:00]</a>.

### Bowling
*   **Ravichandran Ashwin:** Named Player of the Series, largely due to his game-saving century and a six in the last innings in Chennai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:50:00">[17:50:00]</a>. In this Test, Ashwin took five wickets, including three for 50 in the third innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:01:00">[18:01:00]</a>. He now holds 11 Player of the Series awards in his career, matching Muttiah Muralitharan's record, but achieving it in 43 series compared to Muralitharan's 61 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:07:00">[18:07:00]</a>. Ashwin is considered a "once-in-a-generation cricketer" for India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:23:00">[18:23:00]</a>.
*   **Ravindra Jadeja:** Jadeja took four wickets in this game, with three for 34 in the third innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:23:00">[23:23:00]</a>. He has become the 11th cricketer in Test [[Cricket and player performances | cricket]] history to score more than 3,000 runs and take a minimum of 300 wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:28:00">[23:28:00]</a>. He is only the third Indian to reach this milestone, alongside Kapil Dev and Ravichandran Ashwin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:37:00">[23:37:00]</a>. The presence of both Ashwin and Jadeja in the same team is seen as a luxury, making India a formidable side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:24:00">[24:24:00]</a>.
*   **Jasprit Bumrah:** Despite initial uncertainty about his inclusion, Bumrah played and took three for 50 and three for 17 in the game, ending with six wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:30:00">[27:30:00]</a>. He now has 170 wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:49:00">[27:49:00]</a>. Only one bowler in Test [[Cricket and player performances | cricket]] history with over 100 wickets has a lower average than Bumrah: Sid Barnes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:01:00">[28:01:00]</a>. Bumrah's bowling style, including his off-spinners at high speeds, draws comparisons to Barnes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:11:00">[28:11:00]</a>. If his fitness holds, he is projected to cross 200 wickets by the end of the upcoming Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:24:00">[28:24:00]</a>. The conversation about whether he can maintain a bowling average under 20 is ongoing and statistically possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:57:00">[29:57:00]</a>. His legacy is considered safe if he reaches 200 wickets with an average in the low 20s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:16:00">[31:16:00]</a>, and at 170 wickets, he is already in conversations with all-time great bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:38:00">[31:38:00]</a>. He is widely considered [[Comparison of fast bowlers in Indian cricket | India's greatest ever fast bowler]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:19:00">[32:19:00]</a>.

## Venue and Conditions
The venue, Kanpur, became a major topic of discussion due to drainage issues, with standing water on the ground despite full covers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:00:00">[50:00:00]</a>. This prompted calls for India to adopt a model similar to Sri Lanka's sand-based grounds or to establish five major Test centers as suggested by Virat Kohli in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:23:00">[50:23:00]</a>. The Board of Control for [[Cricket and player performances | Cricket]] in India (BCCI) is criticized for not addressing these infrastructural issues in regional venues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:44:00">[51:44:00]</a>. While players desire the best facilities, there is a debate about whether to restrict Test matches to major grounds or spread [[Cricket and player performances | cricket]] wide, subsidizing regional venues to ensure international quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:50:00">[52:50:00]</a>.

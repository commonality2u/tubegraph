India secured a dominant 4-1 series victory against England, showcasing a strategic approach that adapted to various match conditions and player availability. Even with a second-string lineup, India proved to be the superior team in almost every aspect of the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.

## Overall Approach and Pitch Conditions

India demonstrated a clear preference for playing on fair, even pitches, believing that the better team should prevail in such conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>. This strategy minimizes "fluky results" that might occur on highly difficult wickets, as seen in past matches against England or Australia in Pune and Delhi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>. The pitches throughout the series were described as "absolutely sensational" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:13]</a>.

While India largely provided flat wickets in this series, there's a possibility they might still prepare "ragging games" against teams they anticipate will struggle on such surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>. This allows their spinners, such as Ravichandran Ashwin, Kuldeep Yadav, or Ravindra Jadeja, to avoid bowling excessive overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a>. The ideal scenario for India would involve a combination of both types of wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>.

Initially, [[Englands cricket strategy under basball | Bazball]] tactics might have influenced India's thinking, with Ashwin even stating a match was level despite India's strong position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:46">[00:37:46]</a>. However, as the series progressed, India "kind of sat back and let England do their own thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a> and became more relaxed once they "worked out what to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:03">[00:38:03]</a>. India capitalized on nearly every key moment, leading to a fair 4-1 result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>. Even when India made mistakes, their overall superiority meant these errors didn't significantly impact the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>.

India's bowling attack showcased depth and adaptability, particularly in the spin department.

### Spin Bowling Selection

The selection of spinners appears to be evolving. [[Indias bowling strategy and selection in ODIs | Kuldeep Yadav]] is now considered ahead of Axar Patel in Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:15">[00:39:15]</a>. The combination of a wrist-spinner like Kuldeep and a finger-spinner like Ashwin makes more sense for overseas tours than relying on two finger-spinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>. Kuldeep's ability to spin the ball in the opposite direction to Ashwin is a distinct advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:12">[00:40:12]</a>.

This strategy might also benefit Ashwin by allowing him to rest from every game, potentially prolonging his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>. India's management may communicate with Ashwin about specific wickets or series where his expertise as a "holding spinner" would be most valuable, especially in places like New Zealand or South Africa, or when Jadeja is unavailable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:37">[00:40:37]</a>.

For future tours, particularly to Australia, the ideal spin combination would involve Ashwin and Kuldeep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:54">[01:03:54]</a>. Ashwin has proven to be a consistent threat in Australia, while Kuldeep's bowling excels against the tail and when the wicket offers assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:54">[01:03:54]</a>. However, this pairing might complicate the batting lineup, as it could mean sacrificing the batting, fielding, and bowling contributions of Ravindra Jadeja <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:15">[01:04:15]</a>. Jadeja's utility, especially in the first innings, can be a factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:38">[01:04:38]</a>. The likely approach is to field Jadeja, Kuldeep, and three seamers, even if it means risking a weaker number eight or nine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:46">[01:04:46]</a>. Alternatively, including a player like Shardul Thakur or Hardik Pandya at number eight could provide balance, with Hardik's bowling being particularly well-suited for Australian conditions, alongside his superior batting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>.

### Jasprit Bumrah's Impact

Jasprit Bumrah's performance stood out, taking 19 wickets at an average of 16.89 and a strike rate of 32.7 in the series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:0:42">[01:0:42]</a>. His exceptional skill was evident, and it's speculated he would have excelled even further on a pitch with more grass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:1:52">[01:1:52]</a>.

## Player Performance and [[Indias aggressive Test cricket strategies | Adaptability]]

India showed remarkable resilience. Despite being "rocked early," they managed to "brush the dirt off their shoulders" and perform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The team achieved this with several key players absent, including Virat Kohli (on paternal duties), Axar Patel (dropped), and a lineup featuring a backup to their backup keeper and several seamers who had only played one Test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

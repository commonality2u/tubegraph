The recently concluded Champions Trophy 2023 saw India defeat New Zealand comfortably by four wickets with an over to spare in the final <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:14">[02:53:14]</a>. This victory marked India's second back-to-back limited overs ICC trophy within months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:52">[03:13:52]</a>. Over the last 18 months across three ICC tournaments, India has only lost a solitary game – the Travis Head game – and arguably should have won all three without a single defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:35">[03:19:35]</a>. Despite their dominance, the tournament itself was subject to significant criticism and controversy.

## Champions Trophy: A "Nonsense" Tournament

The tournament was described as "nonsense" by many, having been canceled three times and ultimately not being played entirely in the country it was originally scheduled for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:30">[05:00:30]</a>. One team reportedly refused to participate, and the vast majority of games were not particularly good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:05">[05:11:05]</a>. Despite the favored team (India) winning, people remained angry due to how the tournament unfolded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:06">[05:24:06]</a>. It was called "so stupid" and something that almost "broke Cricket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:27">[05:41:27]</a>.

While some suggested an asterisk should be placed next to India's title, it was argued that the Indian cricketers themselves do not deserve such a mark, as they were genuinely the best team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:05">[06:01:05]</a>. India would have been favorites in most places globally, except perhaps on extremely pace-friendly tracks or ridiculous rank turners like Sri Lankan surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>.

## Hosting Controversies and Political Influence

The primary controversy stemmed from the tournament's hosting. It was originally planned to be held in Pakistan, but India refused to travel there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:05">[05:04:05]</a>, leading to the tournament being moved to Dubai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:05">[07:07:05]</a>. This refusal is seen less as a commercial issue and more as a political one, where India "flexes its muscle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:27:00">[52:27:00]</a>. While India-Pakistan games are "commercial gold" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:22:53">[52:22:53]</a>, and other Indian sports teams do tour Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:44:00">[52:44:00]</a>, cricket remains affected by geopolitical considerations more than any other major sport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:00">[12:36:00]</a>.

The hosts note that in the past, other teams like England, New Zealand, and Australia have refused to play World Cup games in certain venues and forfeited, with the ICC accepting their decision without "bending over backwards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:01:00">[53:01:00]</a>. This suggests that the ICC's decision regarding the Champions Trophy was a financial one, driven by India's market power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:42:00">[53:42:00]</a>.

### Fixed Fixtures and Player Exploitation
A long-standing criticism of international cricket tournaments is the practice of "fixing" fixtures, where matches like Australia vs. England, India vs. Pakistan, and other key matchups are pre-arranged. This is considered a form of corruption within cricket, which is often shrugged off as "that's how Cricket is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>.

The extensive travel schedule for the Indian team during the 2023 World Cup in India, which saw them travel "a lap and a half of India" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:52:00">[11:52:00]</a>, is also linked to commercial interests, as broadcasters want India to play everywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>. It's argued that Indian players are exploited by the setup, as their success is tainted by political and administrative decisions that have nothing to do with their performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>.

### Toss Controversies
A conspiracy theory during the 2023 World Cup claimed that tosses were fixed for India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:26:00">[20:26:00]</a>. This was amplified by the fact that India lost 15 consecutive tosses, with Rohit Sharma losing 12 in a row, equaling Brian Lara's record. The probability of this happening is stated to be 0.003% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:05:00">[20:05:00]</a>.

### Broader Issues in Cricket Administration
Cricket is described as a "broken sport" with roots in colonialism, remaining inequitable even after the 2007 financial shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>. The constant presence of officials like Jay Shah on screen during broadcasts is highlighted as not helping the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:44:00">[19:44:00]</a>. This visible influence contributes to public sentiment that can't be easily changed, leading to this Champions Trophy being remembered for "all the wrong reasons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>.

The situation has reached a "breaking point" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a> where not just hardcore fans, but also casual cricket and sports fans are expressing anger. This is problematic for cricket, as it relies on drawing in the casual viewer, not just the dedicated fans who will watch regardless of the issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>.

Concerns extend to the [[challenges_and_political_issues_in_international_cricket|ICC]]'s role and the BCCI's immense power, influenced by the Indian government. The discussion emphasizes that many different entities — the ICC, BCCI, and political parties — have a stake in the Indian cricket team, leading to a complex web of motivations, including political, ego-driven, and valid security concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:50:00">[57:50:00]</a>. This confluence means "everyone wants a piece of this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:07:00">[58:07:00]</a>.

The historical context of cricket administration is noted, with reminders that cricket was not perfectly run even when England and Australia were at the helm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. However, the shift in power, particularly after India's 1983 World Cup win, changed the dynamic, moving from a general love of cricket to a focus on the Indian team itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:21">[01:17:21]</a>.

## Impact on Team Performance

Despite the off-field issues, the Indian team's performance has been exceptional. They were the best team and deserved their victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:05">[06:05:05]</a>. The team is considered one of the best white-ball teams seen, possibly India's greatest ever white-ball side (2023-2025) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:27:00">[13:27:00]</a>. Their depth is immense, with top players like Shubman Gill (No. 1 ODI batter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:46:00">[14:46:00]</a>, Rohit Sharma (transformed himself) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:49:00">[14:49:00]</a>, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, and KL Rahul. They have a luxurious batting lineup extending to number eight, including all-rounders like Ravindra Jadeja and Hardik Pandya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:59:00">[14:59:00]</a>. Their bowling attack is also versatile, with spinners like Varun and Kuldeep who are hard to pick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:00">[15:01:00]</a>.

The transformation of Rohit Sharma, often referred to as "Rohit 3.0," is highlighted. He changed from an accumulator to an aggressive opener, with his power play strike rate jumping from below 76 (2015-2019) to over 115 (2020 onwards) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:24:00">[42:24:00]</a>. This sacrifice of personal runs for the team's betterment exemplifies his leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:54:00">[42:54:00]</a>. Rohit's captaincy decisions, like bringing on Varun and Kuldeep early in the final, were crucial in securing wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:11:00">[43:11:00]</a>.

The article contrasts India's deep lineup with other teams, noting that players not in India's squad, like Yashasvi Jaiswal, would be automatic selections for most other teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:20:00">[15:20:00]</a>. This depth means India has six frontline bowling options and eight batters, making them incredibly difficult to beat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:09:00">[19:09:00]</a>.

## The Future of Tournaments
The discussion touches upon the potential for future tournament structures, like an annual circuit with various "Opens" (Caribbean, African, Asian, Australian) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:49">[01:18:49]</a>, or a Wimbledon-style T20 tournament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:43">[01:18:43]</a> with promotion/relegation. However, it's acknowledged that such ideal solutions are unlikely to happen due to existing power structures and financial interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:25">[01:22:25]</a>.

The conversation concludes with the acknowledgement that India is the best limited overs side, and Indian fans should revel in their team's glory, while also keeping an open mind about the broader issues impacting the sport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:17">[01:27:17]</a>.

[[Rohit Sharmas batting strategy and position in IPL | Rohit Sharma]] was bowled by Ben Stokes with his first comeback ball since July last year, seemingly playing for the narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. There was a claim that he could be facing similar problems as Shuan Gill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Test Opener Performance Analysis

Discussions have focused on where [[Rohit Sharmas batting strategy and position in IPL | Rohit Sharma]] fits among Test openers with a minimum of 1,000 runs in the last five years, and whether he is the best opener in that period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Currently, he averages exactly the same as Usman Khawaja but has scored a couple hundred extra runs, with Dimuth Karunaratne just ahead of both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

What makes [[Rohit Sharmas batting strategy and position in IPL | Rohit Sharma]]'s performance remarkable is that he was not a full-time opener throughout his career, similar to Khawaja <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Translating to an opening role later in one's career is a challenging task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Furthermore, he had struggled in Test Cricket as a middle-order batter before becoming an opener <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Considering the "ragging sideways" Indian wickets and challenges faced during away tours, his last five years as an opener have been "magnificent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### Middle-Order vs. Opening Statistics

When [[Rohit Sharmas batting strategy and position in IPL | Rohit Sharma]] batted in the middle order, he averaged 39 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. This was during a batting era where the match average for the top six players in games he played was around 41 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Batting in Test Cricket has become significantly harder since then <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. The match average for top six players in games he has played has dropped to 33 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. In this tougher period, as an opener, he averages 17 runs more than other top six players, which is considered a "ridiculous record" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

His performance as a middle-order batter showed a stark difference between home and away matches: he averaged 85 at home but only 26 away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. As an opener, this disparity is much more level and solid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>, averaging 54 at home and 43 away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

### Home Series Performance (2019-2024)

His home series performances between 2019 and 2024 include:
*   Average of 132 against South Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.
*   Average of 13 against Bangladesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   Solid averages of 40, 40, and 30 against Sri Lanka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   Average of 57 against England last time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   Overall home average of 54 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

His strike rate and conversion rate are also important, as he consistently makes hundreds on tough wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. 11 of his 12 centuries have resulted in an India win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

### Performance Against Spin vs. Pace

As an opener, [[Rohit Sharmas batting strategy and position in IPL | Rohit Sharma]] averages almost exactly the same against pace and spin at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. However, away from home, he averages lower against spin than against pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. This is interesting because playing spin outside Asia requires a different skill set due to factors like increased bounce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

### Record by Country

His record as an opener by country shows low averages in Australia and South Africa, but these are from only a handful of matches (two in each) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. He has also not played much in the West Indies but has performed "absolutely crushing" there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. His average of 30-35 as an opener in England is considered "fantastic" in most eras, especially his own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. He has had no problems opening at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

### Match Factor and Age

Compared to other top six batters in the same games, [[Rohit Sharmas batting strategy and position in IPL | Rohit Sharma]] performs 41% better in England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a> and 64% better in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. He is seen as one of the Indian batters, alongside Rishabh Pant, who has truly mastered this new era of Indian wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

Regarding his age, [[Rohit Sharmas batting strategy and position in IPL | Rohit Sharma]] is among the players with the most international hundreds after the age of 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

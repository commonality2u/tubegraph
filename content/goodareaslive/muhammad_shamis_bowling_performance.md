[[muhammad_shamis_performance_in_cricket | Muhammad Shami]] has been a standout performer for [[indias_bowling_performance_in_the_test | India's bowling performance]] in the World Cup, with wickets seemingly "following him around" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:53">[01:43:53]</a>. His exceptional form has been a recurring theme, as he's been noted for taking "a million wickets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a> in the tournament.

## Semi-Final Impact
In the semi-final against New Zealand, [[muhammad_shamis_performance_in_cricket | Muhammad Shami's]] early two wickets were crucial. They "certainly made it a lot easier and put some pressure back on New Zealand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:06">[01:20:06]</a>. While [[indias_bowling_performance_in_the_test | India]] wasn't "particularly good with a new ball" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a> overall, Shami was a notable exception, demonstrating his effectiveness from the start.

## Power Play Dominance
Shami plays a significant [[role_of_bowlers_like_muhammad_shami_and_their_impact | role of bowlers like Muhammad Shami and their impact]] in [[indias_bowling_performance_in_the_test | India's bowling performance]] during the power play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. Unlike some bowlers who have to take "huge punts" to get wickets, Indian bowlers, including Shami, can "bowl defensively and take wickets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.

### Historical Power Play Records
[[muhammad_shamis_performance_in_cricket | Muhammad Shami]]'s performance places him among the best in World Cup history for power play bowling.
He currently holds the lowest bowling average in the power play (minimum five wickets and 60 balls) in any World Cup ever, averaging 6.62 runs per wicket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08">[01:13:08]</a>. This is remarkable, especially considering he's "not getting first use of the ball" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a> in every match, meaning he isn't always using the brand new ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.

Comparing him to other top power play bowlers of all time in a World Cup:
*   Shaun Pollock (2003) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>
*   Jason Gillespie (2003) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>
*   Glenn McGrath (2007) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>
While these bowlers generally had lower runs per over, Shami's era is much faster scoring, and he's more of a strike bowler compared to their more defensive approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

[[indias_bowling_performance_in_the_test | India]] as a team also boasts an impressive average of 20 in the power play this World Cup, which is a "huge advantage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.

## Bowling Technique
[[muhammad_shamis_performance_in_cricket | Muhammad Shami]] possesses unique skills, particularly his "natural wobble on his swinging balls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. This allows him to give himself "three bites to the cherry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>, as his deliveries can sometimes swing, sometimes get conventional seam, and sometimes get wobble ball seam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. This multi-faceted approach makes him incredibly effective, even if some of these outcomes might be accidental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

Compared to other top bowlers like [[jasprit_bumrahs_unique_bowling_techniques | Jasprit Bumrah]] and Siraj, who excel with wobble balls or conventional seam, Shami offers a different challenge. [[jasprit_bumrahs_unique_bowling_techniques | Bumrah]] is noted for his skill in extracting movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>, and Siraj for his "incredible wobble ball" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. The Indian bowlers collectively have the "ability to move the ball sideways" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a> better than many others.

## Underrated Status
While [[muhammad_shamis_performance_in_cricket | Muhammad Shami]] has had periods where he "looked better than his record" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a> in Test cricket or struggled in the IPL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>, his current form, particularly in ODIs, is undeniable. He now boasts a strike rate that is "above Mitchell Starc" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>, making it difficult to understand why he wasn't always a first-choice player for [[role_of_mohammed_shami_in_indias_odi_strategy | India's ODI strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>. However, it's acknowledged that he has "developed certain aspects of his game later on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a> and is "unquestionably way better bowler now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a> than in previous World Cups.

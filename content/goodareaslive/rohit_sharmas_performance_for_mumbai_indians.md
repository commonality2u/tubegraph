Rohit Sharma's performance for [[mumbai_indians_performance_analysis | Mumbai Indians]] in the IPL has been described as "blowing hot and cold," with more "cold than hot" for a while <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. There is a notable [[comparison_of_rohit_sharmas_roles_for_mumbai_indians_and_india | difference in his batting approach]] when playing for Mumbai compared to his performances for India in T20s and ODIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## Batting Strategy and Impact

For India, Rohit Sharma made a conscious decision to adopt an aggressive "big swinging" strategy, aiming to "smash the ball" and thereby influencing the white-ball cricket approach of the entire team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This contrasts with his IPL approach for Mumbai, where he often appears more cautious, seemingly trying to "push this one on the off" rather than aggressively smashing the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

Despite this, when [[rohit_sharmas_impact_and_batting_strategy | Rohit Sharma starts going]], he is considered an "unstoppable force," causing opposing teams to panic due to his potential to score a rapid "100 off 30 balls" and drastically change the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Given the strong batting lineup behind him at Mumbai, a quick score like "28 off 14" would be highly beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

### Statistical Observations

It has been noted that [[rohit_sharmas_ipl_performance_versus_expectations | Rohit Sharma has never scored at over 150]] in an IPL season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This is seen as perplexing, given his aggressive batting for India in recent years, where he could have easily achieved a strike rate of "160, 165" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. The "impact sub" rule in the IPL has not seemingly influenced his batting style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

### Batting Position

Funnily enough, [[rohit_sharmas_batting_strategy_and_position_in_ipl | Rohit Sharma's best numbers in the IPL are reportedly at number four]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. However, he is expected to open for Mumbai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

## Post-Captaincy and Future

A potential reason for his fluctuating [[rohit_sharmas_ipl_performance_versus_expectations | IPL performance]] might be an existential struggle related to his role within the Mumbai Indians ecosystem post-captaincy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This situation, where a senior player's position in the leadership structure becomes unclear after [[impact_of_captaincy_on_rohit_sharmas_career_and_performance | stepping down from captaincy]], can deeply affect form, similar to what Virat Kohli experienced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

Regarding his international future, there's a view that Rohit Sharma called time on his T20 career prematurely after the World Cup win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. It's suggested he should continue playing ODI and T20 cricket, and potentially [[rohit_sharmas_test_career_and_performance_analysis | Test cricket]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. His current fitness level is a concern, as his reflexes would require significant work over "3 to 6 months" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. If he addresses his [[rohit_sharmas_fitness_and_future_in_international_cricket | fitness]], he could potentially play for another "two or three years," but this ultimately depends on his personal decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. He is still considered an "incredible captain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

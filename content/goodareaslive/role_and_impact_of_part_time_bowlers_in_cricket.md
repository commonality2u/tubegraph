From: [[goodareaslive]] <br/> 

The classification and impact of [[defining_part_time_bowlers_in_cricket_history | part-time bowlers]] in cricket is a complex and often subjective topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. Discussed during episode 70 of the QuickPicks podcast, defining a [[defining_part_time_bowlers_in_cricket_history | part-time bowler]] versus an all-rounder or a fifth bowler presents a significant challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

## Defining a Part-Time Bowler
The main difficulty in defining a [[defining_part_time_bowlers_in_cricket_history | part-time bowler]] lies in distinguishing them from all-rounders or even occasional bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:45">[01:57:45]</a>. While some attempts have been made to quantify this, such as averaging more than five overs per game in ODI cricket, these definitions can still include players not traditionally considered all-rounders, like Darren Lehmann or Viv Richards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

The discussion highlights that the definition often remains [[the_subjectivity_in_classifying_part_time_versus_allrounder_bowlers | subjective]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. For instance, Steve Waugh, who was originally picked as a bowler and whose bowling kept him in the side early in his Test career, is generally not considered a [[defining_part_time_bowlers_in_cricket_history | part-time bowler]], despite his numbers looking "part-time" due to later injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. Similarly, Hansie Cronje, who might have been a fifth bowler for many teams, was the sixth bowler for South Africa due to their abundance of all-rounders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.

## Role and Impact
[[Role of bowlers in winning cricket tournaments | Part-time bowlers]] often provide crucial utility to a team, acting as partnership breakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a> or offering a different attack when main bowlers are struggling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. Their impact is sometimes remembered more for clutch moments or surprising performances rather than consistent statistical dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. They can be particularly useful in conditions favoring spin or when a team needs additional bowling options to manage workloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

## Notable Part-Time Bowlers

### [[notable_part_time_bowlers_like_sachin_tendulkar_and_carl_hooper | Sachin Tendulkar]]
[[notable_part_time_bowlers_like_sachin_tendulkar_and_carl_hooper | Sachin Tendulkar]] is often considered a handy [[defining_part_time_bowlers_in_cricket_history | part-time bowler]], capable of picking up wickets, especially in ODI cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.
*   **Test Cricket**: 46 wickets at an average of 54 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>.
*   **ODI Cricket**: 154 wickets at an average of 44 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>, with an economy rate of 5.1, considered low for his era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>.
*   **T20Is**: One wicket in his only T20I, averaging 12 with an economy of 4.8 from 15 deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>.
Despite his sometimes "poor" statistics, he was a long-term available bowling option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>, capable of bowling medium pace, off-spin, and leg-spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>. His bowling became less required with the emergence of players like Virender Sehwag and Suresh Raina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.

### Michael Bevan
Michael Bevan is a fascinating case due to his test bowling record, where he took 29 wickets in 18 matches despite actively not wanting to bowl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>.
*   **Test Cricket**: 29 wickets at 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>, including a 10-wicket haul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:00">[10:08:00]</a>.
*   **ODI Cricket**: 36 wickets in 232 ODIs at 46 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>.
He bowled left-arm leg-spin very fast, making it difficult for batters to face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>. He represents the type of [[defining_part_time_bowlers_in_cricket_history | part-time bowler]] who excels despite disliking the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:00">[10:38:00]</a>.

### [[notable_part_time_bowlers_like_sachin_tendulkar_and_carl_hooper | Carl Hooper]]
[[notable_part_time_bowlers_like_sachin_tendulkar_and_car_hooper | Carl Hooper]] is described as a [[defining_part_time_bowlers_in_cricket_history | part-timer]] "in spirit" due to his high bowling average, despite taking a significant number of wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>.
*   **Test Cricket**: 114 wickets in 102 matches at 49.42 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>.

Hooper's bowling action appeared disinterest, yet he was effective, famously dismissing Allan Border seven times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>. He bowled a lot because West Indies often lacked other spinning options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:52:00">[16:52:00]</a>.

### Mohammad Hafeez
Mohammad Hafeez is a debatable pick for [[defining_part_time_bowlers_in_cricket_history | part-time bowler]], with some considering him a high-performing all-rounder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:14:00">[15:14:00]</a>.
*   **Test Cricket**: 53 wickets in 55 matches at 35 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:27:00">[14:27:00]</a>.

He was often the third spinner for Pakistan alongside Saeed Ajmal and Shahid Afridi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:46:00">[14:46:00]</a>. Despite impressive stats, his usage as a bowler varied, leading to the debate over his status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>.

### Doug Walters
Doug Walters is highlighted as a remarkable [[defining_part_time_bowlers_in_cricket_history | part-time bowler]], primarily a seamer, known for taking wickets when thrown the ball, often without wanting to continue bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:31:00">[18:31:00]</a>.
*   **Test Cricket**: 49 wickets in 74 matches at an average of 29 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:21:00">[18:21:00]</a>.

His Test bowling average of 29 is considered "ridiculous" for someone who didn't bowl much and seemingly lacked interest in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:37:00">[19:37:00]</a>.

### Michael Clarke
Michael Clarke, primarily a batsman, was a handy left-arm orthodox spinner.
*   **Test Cricket**: 31 wickets in 115 Tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:46:00">[21:46:00]</a>, averaging 38.19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:18:00">[24:18:00]</a>.

### Simon Katich
Simon Katich is considered an "elite level [[defining_part_time_bowlers_in_cricket_history | part-timer]]" due to his effective left-arm wrist spin despite his reported disdain for bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:22:00">[28:22:00]</a>.

### Craig McMillan
Craig McMillan is characterized as a [[defining_part_time_bowlers_in_cricket_history | part-timer]] with a surprising self-perception as a new-ball bowler despite his medium pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:22:00">[36:22:00]</a>.

### Andrew Symonds
Andrew Symonds is another debatable [[defining_part_time_bowlers_in_cricket_history | part-timer]] due to his dual ability to bowl both seam and spin, making him a utility bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:07:00">[39:07:00]</a>.

Despite her statistically decent ODI record, she was considered aesthetically "horrendous" as a bowler, often delivering full tosses, yet she was effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:14:00">[44:14:00]</a>.

### [[analysis_of_joe_root_as_a_modern_part_time_bowler | Joe Root]]
[[analysis_of_joe_root_as_a_modern_part_time_bowler | Joe Root]] is seen as a very good sixth bowler and thus a [[defining_part_time_bowlers_in_cricket_history | part-timer]], not an all-rounder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:06:00">[46:06:00]</a>.

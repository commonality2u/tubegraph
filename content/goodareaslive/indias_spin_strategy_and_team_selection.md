India's approach to team selection, particularly regarding their spin attack, has been a key factor in their recent success, leading them to be strong contenders in the tournament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.

## Recent Performance and Strategy

India successfully defended a total of 250 runs against New Zealand in Dubai, securing a 44-run victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. This win allowed them to top Group A and set up a semi-final match with Australia in Dubai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. For this match, India opted for a strategy involving four spinners and two seamers, notably dropping Harshit Rana and including Varun Chakravarthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>.

### Varun Chakravarthy's Impact

Varun Chakravarthy delivered a "masterclass" performance against New Zealand, spinning an "absolute web" and recording figures of five wickets for 42 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:52:00">[11:52:00]</a>. His effectiveness stemmed from his unique bowling style, incorporating significant pace variations, ranging from very fast to "ridiculously slow" deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>. Opposing batters struggled to pick the direction of his spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>.

Varun's bowling is described as distinct, not relying on sideways movement like traditional carrom balls, but rather using top spin and micro-variations to deceive batters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a>. This unique approach has made him difficult to play against, with players struggling to adapt to his methods over the last seven or eight months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>. His significant improvement since being "absolutely smashed" by Pakistan in the 2021 T20 World Cup, where he was made a "scapegoat," marks a remarkable comeback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05:00">[14:05:00]</a>. His current form has been described as "literally unplayable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:42:00">[14:42:00]</a>.

### Spin-Heavy Approach Justified

Beyond Chakravarthy, India's other spinners, [[Ravindra Jadeja | Ravindra Jadeja]] and [[Axar Patel | Axar Patel]], were also effective; Jadeja was getting significant rip, and Axar was economical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:58:00">[16:58:00]</a>. The decision to play four spinners was influenced by the tired and slow nature of the Dubai pitch, which has seen extensive use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:52:00">[18:52:00]</a>. This contrasts with Dubai wickets which can sometimes offer pace and bounce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:32:00">[54:32:00]</a>.

The commentators generally agreed that playing four spinners on the current Dubai wicket made strategic sense, especially since India needed to take wickets in the middle overs, a role Kuldeep Yadav had not consistently fulfilled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:50:00">[19:50:00]</a>.

> "I think it's more just to do with they needed wickets in the middle overs and they've gone with the option that they think is most likely to do that, it makes them such a more dangerous team" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:50:00">[19:50:00]</a>

The presence of six frontline bowlers and eight frontline batters allows India significant flexibility in mixing and matching their lineup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:34:00">[32:34:00]</a>.

## Future Team Selection Considerations

The "million-dollar question" for India moving forward is whether to continue with the same four-frontline-spinner, two-seamer formula (with Hardik Pandya being one of the seamers) or to reintroduce a seamer like [[indias_bowling_strategy_and_player_rotation | Harshit Rana]] or even [[role_of_spinners_and_seamers_in_indias_cricket_success | Mohammed Shami]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:09:00">[17:09:00]</a>.

If a seamer were to be brought back, Kuldeep Yadav would likely be the one to make way, despite having done "nothing wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:51:00">[17:51:00]</a>. This is because the team requires a bowler who can take wickets in the middle overs, a role Kuldeep has not consistently filled in this tournament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:04:00">[18:04:00]</a>.

Overall, India is perceived as very strong and the clear favorite to win the semi-final and potentially the trophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:00:00">[27:00:00]</a>.

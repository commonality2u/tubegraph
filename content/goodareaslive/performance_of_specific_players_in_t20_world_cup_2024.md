## India vs. Pakistan

The India vs. Pakistan match was noted for the "trash nature of the pitch," which made scoring difficult and impacted [[player_performance_and_current_form_in_t20_cricket | player performance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>.

### Indian Players

*   **Rohit Sharma:** Hit the ball up in the air and was out early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. His dismissal was anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47:00">[14:47:00]</a>.
*   **Rishabh Pant:** Could have been dismissed 83 times but made 42 runs off 31 balls on a challenging wicket, despite some luck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:19:00">[14:19:00]</a>. This was described as a crucial innings for India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:34:00">[14:34:00]</a>.
*   **Axar Patel:** Scored well early in the innings and was part of India's strong start, helping them reach 50 runs in the first period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:28:00">[13:28:00]</a>. He took an LBW wicket for India, shifting momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. He bowled two overs and performed "really, really well," getting a breakthrough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>.
*   **Arshdeep Singh:** Was sent up the order to bat and contributed runs, even outscoring Hardik Pandya at one point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. He got an edge and was bowling well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. Despite struggling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>, his struggles were not considered the "worst case scenario" for India as he might not play in the Caribbean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>.
*   **Jasprit Bumrah:** His bowling was described as "ridiculous" and "magnificent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>. He is considered unplayable, especially in the middle overs, where he goes at 2.3 runs per over less than expected and is a "plus Wicket Taker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>. He dismissed Babar Azam with a "test delivery wicket" that got big on him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>. He also took Mohammad Rizwan's wicket, which was a "terrible terrible choice of shot" by Rizwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>. He ended with two wickets for 10 runs with two balls left in his spell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00">[12:06:00]</a>. In a previous game against Ireland, the over/under for his over on a betting exchange was one run, indicating his unplayable nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:51:00">[32:51:00]</a>.
*   **Hardik Pandya:** Initially seemed like a liability but then bowled "really well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>. He finished with 2 wickets for 24 runs from his four overs, including 2 for 6 at the end of his spell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:00">[09:59:00]</a>. He struggled with accuracy early on but pulled it back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:08:00">[22:08:00]</a>.
*   **Mohammed Siraj:** Was described as "fantastic." He adapted his bowling from trying to slide the ball through to ripping it, which suited the wicket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>.

### Pakistani Players

*   **Haris Rauf:** Bowled "one of the worst overs" seen from a bowler of his talent before the drinks break, conceding three fours in a row <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. However, he showed a "comeback" after the break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. His bowling improved later, finishing at 7 runs per over, and he was seen as a "catalyst" for Pakistan's comeback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:39:00">[15:39:00]</a>.
*   **Usman Khan:** Was noted for fielding every single ball and attempting catches clearly meant for other players, indicating disarray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.
*   **Mohammad Rizwan:** Started the innings with "two threes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. Despite having a high strike rate early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>, he finished with 31 runs from 44 balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>. His shot selection to Jasprit Bumrah was described as a "terrible, terrible choice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>. While his strike rate was criticized, it was considered acceptable for the difficult pitch conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>. He also played some risky shots while trying to anchor the innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:43:00">[33:43:00]</a>.
*   **Babar Azam:** Had a strike rate of 300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. His wicket against India was seen as a turning point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>.
*   **Naseem Shah:** Was "absolutely incredible" and "in tears" at the end of the match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>. He came within a meter of giving Pakistan a last-ball chance to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>. He was described as "brilliant" and at his best reminded the speaker of Pat Cummins, but as a slightly better white-ball bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:17:00">[15:17:00]</a>.
*   **Mohammad Amir:** Was a little wide early on when swinging the ball, suggesting he should have bowled straighter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:29:00">[15:29:00]</a>.
*   **Imad Wasim:** His bowling, especially to left-handers, was praised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:37:00">[15:37:00]</a>. He was sent out to bat and had a strike rate under 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>.
*   **Shadab Khan:** Hardik Pandya bowled a good short ball to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>.
*   **Fakhar Zaman:** Went "a little bit nuts" at one point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.

He and Kingma bowled well but were not the ideal "hit the wicket" bowlers needed later in the innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:01:00">[19:01:01]</a>. He was identified as one of the better players on the New York pitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:17:00">[34:17:00]</a>.

*   **David Miller:** His innings was described as "magnificent" and one of the best he has played <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:19:00">[19:19:00]</a>. He patiently waited for the ball to be in the right area and punished it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:01:00">[20:01:00]</a>. He was praised for keeping his shape on the challenging pitch, unlike Mohammad Rizwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:16:00">[21:16:00]</a>.
*   **Anrich Nortje:** Should take the pitch with him everywhere, indicating his suitability for the conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:21:00">[21:21:00]</a>.
*   **Marco Jansen:** Bowled quite well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:24:00">[21:24:00]</a>.
*   **Keshav Maharaj:** Bowled too short and was slightly more expensive, with the wicket not suiting him brilliantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:29:00">[21:29:00]</a>.

## Australia vs. England

Bangladesh's cricket team has faced significant [[challenges_for_bangladeshs_cricket_team | challenges]] in their batting performance in ODI cricket, particularly in recent matches. While their bowlers often provide a good foundation, the batting lineup has struggled to convert potential into substantial scores, leading to difficulties in winning matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Overall Batting Performance
The team's batting has been described as "dreadful," often failing to establish a strong start in matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Their inability to stay at the crease early on is a major concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

As an example of their struggles, Litton Das, despite being considered one of their six most talented players, had a batting average of only 1.2 in either five or six ODIs last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. His lack of runs meant he couldn't be consistently selected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

## Statistical Comparison (Since 2022)

### Top Six Batting
Since 2022, when comparing the top six batting average and strike rate among Champions Trophy teams:
*   India's top six average around 45 with a strike rate of nearly a run a ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   Australia's top six average around 37, also striking at almost a run a ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.
*   Bangladesh's top six, in stark contrast, average only 29 and strike at less than 80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. This indicates a significant gap in both scoring rate and consistency compared to other top teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

### Top Three Batting
The situation is even worse for Bangladesh's top three batsmen:
*   Their top three average 27.38 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
*   Compared to India's top three averaging 48 (despite aiming for intent) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>, and Australia's 43 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>, Bangladesh falls far behind.
*   Even [[challenges_faced_by_englands_batsmen | England]], who are currently inconsistent, average 33 with a strike rate of 94 from their top three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
*   Afghanistan, a team that plots more in the middle overs, averages around 100 runs from their top three per game, albeit at a slower pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Bangladesh, however, scores slowly and gets "no runs" from their top order, highlighting the severe [[performance_analysis_of_bangladesh_cricket_team | performance analysis of Bangladesh Cricket Team]] challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

## Individual Batting Performances

### Ridoy
Ridoy had a challenging 2022 season, playing mostly against West Indies. However, in 2023, playing around 25-26 ODIs, he demonstrated the kind of batter he could be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. He has the potential to average in the high 30s or low 40s during a good peak, currently striking at 80-85 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. He recently had to rebuild for a long period but impressed, showing he can be a crucial middle-order anchor for the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. Notably, his ability to bat well even with cramps was observed as a highlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

### Jakir Ali
Jakir Ali possesses a unique and interesting batting method that challenges bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. He has the ability to violently back away or walk right across his stumps, a tactic that makes it difficult for bowlers to establish a consistent line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. This movement can be both to create room for shots and to actively put the bowler off, making him an unpredictable batsman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. Teams have struggled to find the best place to bowl to him due to his varied movements at the crease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.

## Conclusion
While individual players like Ridoy and Jakir Ali show promise, Bangladesh's batting overall remains a significant weakness in ODI cricket. The statistics reveal a severe deficit in both scoring rate and average compared to their competitors, indicating that their batting lineup is consistently among the weakest in international tournaments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

The nature of cricket pitches, particularly in certain T20 World Cup games, has been a significant topic of discussion, with some described as "absolutely crazy coconuts bananas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The [[cricket_pitch_conditions_and_their_impact_on_matches | pitch conditions]] have had a profound [[impact_of_pitch_conditions_on_gameplay | impact on gameplay]] and results, leading to unpredictable and sometimes concerning match outcomes.

## General Characteristics of Problematic Pitches
The pitch for the India vs. Pakistan match was critically described as being of "trash nature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, with the suggestion that it "should be burned" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This particular wicket exhibited inconsistent bounce, with balls occasionally "hit[ting] the stickers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a> or bouncing "like a tennis ball" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Such inconsistency made it a "dreadful pitch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:42">[00:38:42]</a>, even considered "unsafe" due to batters frequently getting hit in the hand by unpredictable deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:33">[00:38:33]</a>.

### Evolution of Pitch Conditions
The [[impact_of_pitch_conditions_on_the_match_outcome | wicket changed a little bit as things went on]] during matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, often playing "worse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a> as the game progressed. This meant the ball reacted "differently when it was put into the pitch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>, further complicating batting.

## [[Impact of pitch conditions on batting and bowling | Impact on Batting]]
Batting on these pitches proved exceptionally challenging. India, despite a strong start, saw the pitch "started playing worse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>, contributing to their collapse from 89 for three to 119 all out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Chasing even a seemingly low target like 119 was "really really hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

*   **Inconsistent Bounce**: The unpredictable bounce meant batters like Mohammad Rizwan struggled to maintain shape, fearing the ball would bounce higher or not come on at the expected pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>. This often led to "so many edges and balls flying up in the air" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Scoring Difficulty**: Teams often struggled to score freely, with many overs yielding minimal runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Achieving 50 runs on such a pitch was considered a great start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, as some matches saw teams struggling to reach that mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Strategic Choices**: While some suggest a "conservative approach" and anchoring innings on tough pitches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:18">[00:33:18]</a>, the speaker believes attacking is more effective, as it's "hard to Anchor" due to the need to play risky shots to keep up with the rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>. India's decision to attack early on, despite some luck, was seen as crucial to their victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.
*   **Notable Batting Performances**: Rishabh Pant's 42 off 31 balls was highlighted as a strong performance given the pitch conditions and the luck involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. David Miller's innings for South Africa was considered one of his best, as he effectively dealt with overpitched balls and waited for the right area to punish deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>.

## [[Impact of pitch conditions on batting and bowling | Impact on Bowling]]
The pitches favored specific types of bowlers and required adaptation.

*   **Seamers**: Pakistani seamers, after an initial period of disarray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, adapted well as the wicket changed, leading to a significant turnaround <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Jasprit Bumrah**: Regarded as an "unplayable" bowler on good wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:45">[00:32:45]</a>, Bumrah's ability to bowl "fast and straight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a> was particularly effective. He was described as a "completely different beast" due to his ability to break through at any stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   **Axar Patel and Mohammed Siraj**: Axar Patel bowled "really really well" and secured a crucial breakthrough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>. Mohammed Siraj initially struggled but then adapted, realizing the need to "rip the ball" on the wicket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
*   **Hardik Pandya**: Pandya initially looked like a liability but then bowled "really well" as the wicket changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>, ending with two wickets for 24 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
*   **Spinners**: Wrist spinners were deemed "unnecessary" on this type of wicket, favoring finger spinners or additional seamers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>. Akeal Hosein's "unique" bowling, including his traditional arm ball, was highly effective against associate teams on this pitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>.

## Match Outcomes and Betting
The challenging [[influence_of_pitch_conditions_on_match_outcomes | pitch conditions]] led to unexpected match results, such as Pakistan losing to the USA and then failing to chase 119 against India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Despite the difficulty, the speaker found success betting on "unders" (lower total scores) due to the unpredictable nature of the pitches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a>.

## Comparison to Other Pitches
The New York pitch is described as "not a real pitch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:15">[00:39:15]</a> and "one of the worst I've ever covered" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:20">[00:38:20]</a>. Canada's higher score against a weaker bowling lineup on a slightly less extreme wicket is noted for context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

> [!DANGER] Pitch Safety
> "This pitch was not satisfactory today it was unsafe how many batters in a T20 game getting hit in the hand off balls that shouldn't be hitting anyone in the hand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:31]</a>.

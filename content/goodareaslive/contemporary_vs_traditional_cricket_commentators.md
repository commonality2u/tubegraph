In episode three of Crick Picks, the hosts, Bam Kazi, Estelle Vasudevan, and Jared Kimber, draft their top five [[best_cricket_commentators_all_time | cricket commentators of all time]], leading to a discussion on the evolving landscape of [[cricket_commentators_analysis | cricket commentary]], including the differences between traditional and contemporary styles, and the [[criteria_for_evaluating_cricket_commentators | criteria for evaluating cricket commentators]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The discussion highlights the subjective nature of judging commentators, noting that [[challenges_in_modern_cricket_journalism | it is harder to evaluate commentators than World Cup matches or kits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Factors like cultural background and the sheer volume of exposure to a commentator influence perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

### Traditional Voices

Traditional commentators often set the standard for generations, though their styles might be viewed differently in retrospect.

*   **Richie Benaud**
    Richie Benaud is acknowledged as a figure who "revolutionized [[cricket_commentators_analysis | cricket commentary]]" and was "right up there" in influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Despite his iconic status and being considered "the voice of cricket" in major markets like Australia and England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>, one host suggests that his actual [[cricket_analysis_and_commentary_on_the_match | commentary]] might be "slightly overrated" and not as strong as widely remembered upon re-listening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>. Nevertheless, his knowledge, ability to explain the game, and use of silence were exceptional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>. He was so famous he became a comedy character in Australian radio plays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a>.

At his peak, he was outstanding, explaining cricket clearly and saying exactly what he felt without sugar-coating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. However, his long career led to repetition of stories and points, which may have diminished his overall standing for some listeners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

### The Subjectivity of Evaluation

The discussion consistently emphasizes that ranking [[cricket_commentators_analysis | commentators]] is a "very subjective list" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a>. Factors beyond pure [[cricket_analysis_and_commentary_on_the_match | analysis]] and factual information, such as voice quality, accent, and personal preference, heavily influence how a commentator is received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:05">[00:49:05]</a>. Many commentators are former players who may or may not take the role seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:15">[00:49:15]</a>. The hosts note that the majority of their chosen commentators are those who "take it very, very seriously" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:26">[00:49:26]</a>, which serves as a key [[criteria_for_evaluating_cricket_commentators | criterion]].

Notable omissions from the specific top-tier lists that are mentioned include Mark Nicholas, Ian Smith, Danny Morrison, Dean Jones, Bill Lawry, Jim Maxwell, Jonathan Agnew, Brian Witherall, and Isa Guha, among others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:02">[00:41:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>. The debate underscores that while some commentators are broadly recognized for their skill and influence, personal connection and style preference ultimately shape individual "best of" lists.

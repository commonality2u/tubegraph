The Crick picks podcast, in episode 19, conducted a draft-style discussion to identify the top five currently active all-format cricketers [00:00:37]. The criteria for selection mandated that players must be actively participating in all three formats of the game: Test, One Day International (ODI), and Twenty20 International (T20I) [00:00:58]. For example, [[impactful_cricketers_with_average_statistics | David Warner]] did not qualify as he had retired from Tests and ODIs [00:00:53]. The draft followed a snake-style order (1-2-3, then 3-2-1) [00:01:02].

## Player Selections

The following players were selected in the draft:

### Jasprit Bumrah
*   **Selected By:** Estelle [00:03:30]
*   **Justification:** Considered the best all-format bowler and cricketer currently playing [00:03:39], despite missing a fair number of games [00:04:43]. He is described as the most skillful pacer of his generation, possessing "tricks in his bag" and pinpoint execution [00:04:41]. Bumrah can be a defensive bowler but also delivers "nagging lengths" and Yorkers that make batters look like amateurs, as seen against England [00:04:51]. His success in Test Cricket, after initial doubts, has been "revolutionary," proving that bowlers good in limited overs can excel in the long format [00:05:15].

### Kagiso Rabada
*   **Selected By:** Jared [00:06:14]
*   **Justification:** Valued for his consistent threat of taking wickets across all three formats [00:06:19]. While questions exist regarding his T20 International performances, he maintains a T20 average of 23 [00:07:06]. He is regarded as a "guaranteed Wicket" in all formats, possibly even more so than Bumrah in that specific aspect [00:07:38].

### Rohit Sharma
*   **Selected By:** Bam [00:08:17]
*   **Justification:** His recent performances have been "phenomenal" [00:08:20]. In ODI [[cricket_and_player_performances | Cricket]], particularly during the World Cup, he "completely changed the way he was batting" by attacking aggressively in the powerplay, despite not scoring double hundreds as frequently [00:08:23]. He was a significant reason for India's batting success in the ODI World Cup [00:08:44]. As a Test opener, he has been a "revelation," especially overseas, known for his attacking style [00:08:50].

### Mitchell Marsh
*   **Selected By:** Bam [00:10:29]
*   **Justification:** Described as a "hipster pick" [00:10:05], Marsh has become essential for Australia across formats since his return, particularly in Test Cricket [00:10:32]. He provides "liberty in the Low Middle order" and, alongside Travis Head, helps Australia take charge of innings [00:10:39]. In T20 [[player_performance_and_current_form_in_t20_cricket | Cricket]], he bats first drop and is expected to captain Australia's T20 squad [00:11:00]. His impact in Australia's T20 and ODI World Cup victories is highlighted [00:11:13]. He is considered a "factor in all three formats" [00:12:18].

### Virat Kohli
*   **Selected By:** Jared [00:12:25]
*   **Justification:** Despite perceptions of a decline, his recent numbers are strong: a Test average of 42 (with two centuries in 12 games) [00:12:42], an ODI average of 64 at a run-a-ball [00:12:53], and a T20 International average of 53 with a strike rate of 140 [00:12:59]. His ODI World Cup performance was notable [00:13:08]. Even in his current form, he is considered "much better than other players" [00:14:02]. While [[comparison_of_cricket_legends | Virat Kohli]] has a strong claim to be the greatest all-format player of all time [00:06:34], his current form was specifically assessed for this draft [00:08:03].

### Babar Azam
*   **Selected By:** Estelle [00:16:37]
*   **Justification:** Possesses a "pretty solid record across formats" [00:16:40]. Despite recent criticism about his approach, particularly in limited overs, his performance in the PSL suggested a potential upturn [00:16:48]. However, his Test average in 2023 was 22, and he struggled against top nations in ODI [[recent_performances_of_asian_cricket_players | Cricket]] [00:17:27]. A year and a half prior, he was considered almost the number one all-format player [00:18:04].

### Kuldeep Yadav
*   **Selected By:** Estelle [00:19:00]
*   **Justification:** His performance against England recently underscored his value [00:19:52]. Kuldeep's journey is noted for his growth through failures and low points, making him almost indispensable, especially in the long format in India [00:19:40]. He is considered a consistent wicket-taking option in limited overs [[cricket_and_player_performances | Cricket]] [00:20:02]. He is praised as possibly the "most talented spinner going around" and is now playing all formats for India [00:20:12].

### Daryl Mitchell
*   **Selected By:** Jared [00:22:37]
*   **Justification:** His story is described as "incredible" [00:22:47]. Mitchell's high value in the IPL (14 crore) is noted [00:22:51]. He has played "incredible Innings" in the T20 World Cup and ODI [[cricket_and_player_performances | Cricket]], and is considered "one of the best test batters in the world at the moment" [00:23:00]. He achieves this without significant bowling contributions [00:23:07]. He is currently in "Peak form" and understands his game well [00:23:17].

### Shubman Gill
*   **Selected By:** Bam [00:24:10]
*   **Justification:** A youngster with a "glittering future" [00:24:05]. He averages 61 in 44 ODI games [00:24:13], has been "absolutely amazing in the IPL" T20 [[player_performance_and_current_form_in_t20_cricket | Cricket]] [00:24:38], and has "silenced all of those people" who questioned his Test career with strong performances against England [00:25:00]. His ability to score crucial runs in third and fourth innings of Tests is highlighted [00:25:19]. He is seen as a "main stay in all three formats for India" [00:25:39].

### Naseem Shah
*   **Selected By:** Bam [00:27:12]
*   **Justification:** Considered a "projection pick" [00:27:59]. He is currently regarded as Pakistan's best seamer, with a "higher ceiling than Shaheen" [00:27:16]. Naseem can bowl in all phases of limited overs [[cricket_and_player_performances | Cricket]], with pinpoint accuracy and nagging lengths [00:27:30]. He has performed well in Test [[cricket_and_player_performances | Cricket]] [00:27:52] and is very handy with the bat, scoring "crucial runs" and hitting "crucial sixes" [00:28:10]. His athleticism and "beautiful actions" are also praised [00:28:05].

### Mohammed Shami
*   **Selected By:** Jared [00:30:00]
*   **Justification:** His performances in ODI and Test [[cricket_and_player_performances | Cricket]] are highly regarded [00:30:05]. Over the last couple of years, he has significantly improved as a T20 bowler, evidenced by his IPL 2023 bowling average of 18 [00:30:11]. While he might be expensive at the death in T20s, his ability to take early wickets makes him a threat [00:32:04]. He is also noted for having the best strike rate ever in World Cup [[cricket_and_player_performances | Cricket]] [00:32:23].

### Josh Hazlewood
*   **Selected By:** Estelle [00:32:35]
*   **Justification:** Often "pigeonholed" as primarily a Test bowler [00:32:54], Hazlewood has performed "surprisingly well" in limited overs [[cricket_and_player_performances | Cricket]] [00:33:00]. His recent Test figures (58 wickets in 13 matches at 21) are "pretty good" [00:33:47]. In ODIs, he maintains an economy of 4.74, and in T20Is, an economy of 7.94 [00:33:55]. His ability to take early wickets without conceding many runs is a significant asset [00:34:42]. He is considered the "underappreciated bowler" within Australia's pace trio [00:35:14].

### Ravindra Jadeja
*   **Selected By:** Estelle [00:35:45]
*   **Justification:** Despite batting not being as strong in the last year [00:35:53], his "ability with the ball" makes up for it, especially in conditions he plays in [00:35:58]. He is described as an "impactful bowler" in limited overs [[cricket_and_player_performances | Cricket]] and capable of sustaining his performance across all three formats [00:36:13]. His batting at the death in T20 [[cricket_and_player_performances | Cricket]] has been valuable, at one point making him "the best death hitter in the world" [00:37:04]. His fielding is also a major positive, ensuring he is "never a negative T20 player" [00:37:16]. He is considered the "ultimate utility player" [00:37:51].

### Matt Henry
*   **Selected By:** Jared [00:39:04]
*   **Justification:** His recent Test [[cricket_and_player_performances | Cricket]] average is 25, ODI average 27 with an economy of five, and T20 average 23 with an economy of 7.8 [00:39:11]. He is an excellent new-ball bowler [00:39:31] and is "almost impossible to play with that brand new ball" [00:39:48]. Henry is described as "incredibly skillful," "incredibly accurate," and possessing "good energy on the ball" [00:40:05]. He is seen as having "become much better" in recent years [00:40:25] and is considered New Zealand's best all-format bowler after Trent Boult [00:41:15]. He was the player of the series in New Zealand's recent Test series against Australia [00:41:31].

### Mohammad Rizwan
*   **Selected By:** Bam [00:43:34]
*   **Justification:** Despite his T20 strike rate being an issue, he provides "sure shot runs" and can anchor an innings [00:43:40]. In ODI [[cricket_and_player_performances | Cricket]], he is a "very safe choice in the middle order" with an average of 40 [00:43:05]. In Test [[cricket_and_player_performances | Cricket]], he is potentially Pakistan's "best Wicket keeper batter ever," averaging over 40 in 30 Test matches, with most of these runs scored away from home [00:43:22]. His wicket-keeping skills provide a "huge boost" to his value [00:44:37]. He is considered "essential to most of Pakistan's teams" [00:43:51].

## Players Considered But Not Picked
*   **Trent Boult:** His availability across all formats was questioned [00:01:14].
*   [[comparison_of_cricket_legends | Kevin Durant]] was mentioned in jest as a new cricket league [00:01:40].
*   **Jonny Bairstow:** His current form, particularly in Test [[cricket_and_player_performances | Cricket]], saw him slip off the list, despite being a strong contender a year ago [00:44:50].
*   **Jofra Archer:** Was considered a "hipster pick" that wasn't taken [00:11:53]. Like [[challenges_of_being_a_successful_allformat_cricketer | Rishabh Pant]], he was a strong talent who would be on the list if not for recent injury and lack of play [00:26:50].
*   **KL Rahul:** Unlucky not to be on the list [00:36:31].
*   **Pat Cummins:** An interesting case due to his T20 performances, but expected to be a star in the IPL [00:46:38].
*   **Tim Southee:** Another deserving player mentioned [00:46:50].
*   **Kane Williamson:** Not on the list as he has retired from some formats [00:46:58].
*   **Quinton de Kock:** Doesn't play all formats [00:47:08].
*   **Ben Stokes:** Retired from ODIs [00:47:13].

*   **Shakib Al Hasan:** An "honorary mention" and was once number one on a similar list [00:50:36].
*   **Curtis Campher:** Described as the "Walmart version of Marsh" and plays above his talent level in every format, being a constant threat as he bats, bowls, and fields [00:51:20].
*   **Harry Tector:** Mentioned but not considered strong enough in all three formats [00:51:28].
*   **Rashid Khan:** His recent injury and lack of Test [[cricket_and_player_performances | Cricket]] appearances led to him being excluded, despite his talent [00:52:16].

## Final Thoughts
The podcast highlighted that despite initial assumptions, there are more active all-format cricketers than one might think [00:53:35]. The challenge lies in [[evaluating_current_cricket_players_across_formats | evaluating current cricket players across formats]] based on their recent performance and sustained presence in all three forms of the game, rather than just their all-time great status or past achievements. The discussion also touches upon [[comparison_of_cricket_legends | Best Test Cricket Allrounders in History]] and [[notable_cricket_fielding_performances | challenges of being a successful allformat cricketer]].

The 39th episode of the Crick Piix podcast debated the best Test series wins in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>. The hosts, Baram Kazi, Estelle Vasudevan, and Jared Kimber, selected their top five series in a snake-style draft (1-2-3, 3-2-1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.

## Challenges of the Topic

The hosts found this topic particularly difficult to research, as comprehensive online lists for Test series wins are uncommon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:20">[02:00:20]</a>. It required extensive research into upsets and away records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>, unlike lists for individual Test matches, which would have been 83% easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. Jared Kimber noted that [[sri_lankas_famous_away_test_series_wins | Sri Lanka]] had a significant advantage due to their history of major overseas wins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

## Drafted Series Victories

### Baram Kazi's Selections

1.  **[[sri_lankas_famous_away_test_series_wins | Sri Lanka]] 2-0 vs. South Africa (Feb 2019)**
    This clean sweep is considered one of the biggest coups in Test history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. Kusal Perera's innings of 153 not out in the first Test, leading to a one-wicket win, is rated by some as higher than Ben Stokes' Headingley effort due to the away conditions in South Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>. [[sri_lankas_famous_away_test_series_wins | Sri Lanka]] was the only Asian side to have won a Test series in South Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. The second Test was a complete team performance, with [[sri_lankas_famous_away_test_series_wins | Sri Lanka]] winning by eight wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. This win was unexpected, especially against a South African side that still featured players like Faf du Plessis, Hashim Amla, Dale Steyn, and Kagiso Rabada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>.

    > "The gravity of this win maybe it's not like given its uh due recognition or maybe it is." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>

2.  **Pakistan vs. India in Bengaluru (1987)**
    Pakistan's 1-0 victory in the five-match Test series against India in 1987 stands out as the only Test series Pakistan has ever won in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:57:00">[19:57:00]</a>. The series featured four draws before the decisive final Test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:05:00">[19:05:00]</a>. On a spinning pitch in Bengaluru, Iqbal Qasim and Tauseef Ahmed, lesser-known spinners, combined for 18 of the 20 Indian wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:11:00">[19:11:00]</a>. India fell short by just 17 runs in their chase, despite Sunil Gavaskar's brilliant knock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:46:00">[19:46:00]</a>. This series is iconic because it may remain a unique achievement in history due to geopolitical factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:02:00">[20:02:00]</a>.

3.  **Bangladesh 2-0 vs. Pakistan (2024)**
    This recent 2-0 clean sweep by Bangladesh in Rawalpindi is significant because Bangladesh completely outplayed Pakistan in all three departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:28:00">[21:28:00]</a>. Key performances included Litton Das's 138 after an injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:32:00">[21:32:00]</a> and Mehidy Hasan Miraz scoring two fifties and taking 10 wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:44:00">[21:44:00]</a>. The victory came at a time of unrest and revolution in Bangladesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:55:00">[21:55:00]</a>. Bangladesh had never defeated Pakistan in 13 prior Test attempts and had only won six out of 65 away Tests before this series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:09:00">[22:09:00]</a>. They won the second Test in three days, coming from behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:20:00">[22:20:00]</a>.

    > "The magnitude of the win is such that I feel like even though it's just happened right now it deserves to be on the list." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:38:00">[22:38:00]</a>

4.  **[[englands_historic_2012_test_series_win_in_india | England]] vs. India (2012)**
    [[englands_historic_2012_test_series_win_in_india | England]]'s 2-1 victory in the four-match series is notable because no team has won a Test series in India since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:30:00">[39:30:00]</a>. After losing the first Test in Ahmedabad by nine wickets, [[englands_historic_2012_test_series_win_in_india | England]] bounced back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:35:00">[39:35:00]</a>. Alastair Cook scored three centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:43:00">[39:43:00]</a>, while Graeme Swann took 20 wickets and Monty Panesar 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:48:00">[39:48:00]</a>. Kevin Pietersen's 186 at the Wankhede Stadium was also a highlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:53:00">[39:53:00]</a>. [[englands_historic_2012_test_series_win_in_india | England]] defeated India at their historic home grounds, Wankhede and Eden Gardens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:00:00">[40:00:00]</a>. This series is remembered for its iconic moments and as the last time India lost a home series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:30:00">[40:30:00]</a>.

    > "It might be certainly it might be the greatest series they've ever played in India." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:48:00">[43:48:00]</a>

5.  **Zimbabwe vs. Pakistan (1998)**
    Zimbabwe's 1-0 win in the three-match series against Pakistan is historic against a strong Pakistan team that was difficult to beat at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:43:00">[44:43:00]</a>. Despite the last two Tests being affected by fog and rain, Zimbabwe's victory in Peshawar was earned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:57:00">[44:57:07]</a>. Neil Johnson scored a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:13:00">[45:13:00]</a>, and the pace trio of Pommie Mbangwa, Henry Olonga, and Heath Streak rattled Pakistan, taking 18 wickets between them in the winning Test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:21:00">[45:21:00]</a>. Defeating a Pakistan side featuring Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis with fast bowlers in Pakistan was a monumental achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:01:00">[46:01:00]</a>.

### Estelle Vasudevan's Selections

1.  **[[indias_historic_cricket_victory_in_perth | India]] in Australia (2020-21 Border-Gavaskar Trophy)**
    This series was chosen because of India's remarkable comeback after being bowled out for 36 in the first Test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>. India was missing many first-choice players, including Virat Kohli, who left after the first Test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>. Key moments included Ajinkya Rahane's Boxing Day century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>, Ravichandran Ashwin and Hanuma Vihari's defiant draw in Sydney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>, and the Gabba Test where India, without Jasprit Bumrah, Ashwin, and Ravindra Jadeja, chased down 329 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>. Shubman Gill (91) and Rishabh Pant (89*) were instrumental, supported by Washington Sundar and Shardul Thakur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>. This win was significant as it was against a full-strength Australian side, unlike India's 2018-19 win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>.

    > "Because of the injuries it really does completely propel it and if you you know if you like me and you've studied the history of test Cricket generally when you start to have a run of injuries like that it just becomes a tournament where you end up with like the physio Fielding." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>

2.  **[[sri_lankas_famous_away_test_series_wins | Sri Lanka]] vs. [[englands_historic_2012_test_series_win_in_india | England]] (2014)**
    This two-match series was highly dramatic, with both games going down to the last over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:00">[14:43:00]</a>. The first Test, which was drawn, saw [[sri_lankas_famous_away_test_series_wins | Sri Lanka]] survive with their weakest ever number 11, Nuwan Pradeep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:00">[15:10:00]</a>. In the second Test, [[sri_lankas_famous_away_test_series_wins | Sri Lanka]] sealed the win, with Angelo Mathews playing an "unstoppable" innings that led to comparisons to the [[greatest_test_batters_of_all_time | Fab Four]] at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52:00">[15:52:00]</a>. James Anderson and Moeen Ali batted for a significant period for [[englands_historic_2012_test_series_win_in_india | England]] in the final session, making the win even more impressive for [[sri_lankas_famous_away_test_series_wins | Sri Lanka]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26:00">[15:26:00]</a>.

    > "It's very rare see a captain like and you think oh my God aliser cook doesn't know what to do here like aliser cook look could not look any less like a test captain at that point where he just completely lost a pot." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:58:00">[15:58:00]</a>

3.  **[[sri_lankas_famous_away_test_series_wins | Sri Lanka]] vs. [[englands_historic_2012_test_series_win_in_india | England]] (1998)**
    This was a solitary Test match, but its significance led to its inclusion. Muttiah Muralitharan took 16 wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:44:00">[26:44:00]</a>. There was a sense of ill-feeling in the [[sri_lankas_famous_away_test_series_wins | Sri Lankan]] camp about how [[englands_historic_2012_test_series_win_in_india | England]] treated them with only a one-off Test at the end of the summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:51:00">[26:51:00]</a>. [[englands_historic_2012_test_series_win_in_india | England]] players were reportedly tired and emotionally done after a long series against South Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:11:00">[27:11:00]</a>. This win, particularly with Arjuna Ranatunga's bold decision to bowl first, solidified [[sri_lankas_famous_away_test_series_wins | Sri Lanka]]'s announcement as a serious Test nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:22:00">[28:22:00]</a>. It led to [[sri_lankas_famous_away_test_series_wins | Sri Lanka]] being given multiple Test matches in future tours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:52:00">[27:52:00]</a>.

    > "How frequently do we get to see a spinner go to the oval and take 16 wickets right like that was also immense." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:05:00">[30:05:00]</a>

4.  **Australia vs. India in India (2004)**
    Australia's victory in India in 2004 was seen as the "final frontier" for the Australian team at their peak, cementing their status as one of the [[best_test_cricket_allrounders_in_history | best Test teams ever]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:17:00">[36:17:00]</a>. Beating India in India remains an incredibly difficult task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:27:00">[36:27:00]</a>. This series held particular significance given Australia's prior failures in India, notably the 2001 series and the [[indias_historic_cricket_victory_in_perth | Kolkata Test]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:11:00">[37:11:00]</a>. Despite India winning the last Test, Australia dominated the series, with Michael Clarke having a breakout performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:08:00">[39:08:00]</a>.

    > "It's an interesting pick isn't it because it it might seem silly now because they were the best team in the world yeah and maybe the best team we've ever had right but they lost a series in shanka as well yeah uh they should have won 2001 like they should have won that series they they put themselves into a really good position to win that series." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:03:00">[37:03:00]</a>

5.  **South Africa vs. Australia in Australia (2012)**
    South Africa's victory in Australia in 2012 is remembered for the incredible blockathon by Faf du Plessis (110* off 376 balls) and AB de Villiers (33 off 220 balls) in the Adelaide Test, saving the game for South Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:53:00">[47:53:00]</a>. South Africa then went on to win the third Test, with Hashim Amla scoring nearly 200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:31:00">[48:31:00]</a>. This series solidified South Africa's reputation as the dominant Test team of that era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:38:00">[48:38:00]</a>.

### Jared Kimber's Selections

1.  **[[sri_lankas_famous_away_test_series_wins | Sri Lanka]] vs. New Zealand (1994-95)**
    This series is significant as it marked the emergence of Aravinda de Silva's reputation outside of Asia and ODI cricket, with his brilliant performances on green wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>. At this stage, [[sri_lankas_famous_away_test_series_wins | Sri Lanka]] hadn't had a major away win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:00">[10:55:00]</a>. This victory in New Zealand is considered a precursor to [[sri_lankas_famous_away_test_series_wins | Sri Lanka]]'s successes in 1996 and 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>. Despite not being widely famous due to the teams involved, it remains a talked-about series in New Zealand and [[sri_lankas_famous_away_test_series_wins | Sri Lanka]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>. Chaminda Vaas also had a breakout series with many wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>.

2.  **New Zealand vs. Pakistan (1969)**
    This was New Zealand's first-ever Test series win, achieved away from home in Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>. The historical context is important as New Zealand took 39 years to win a series after starting Test cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:00">[13:42:00]</a>. This victory in 1969 is seen as the beginning of New Zealand's rise as a Test team, leading to them becoming one of the better teams in the 1970s and 80s, and eventually World Test Champions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:52:00">[13:52:00]</a>.

    > "Yeah unfortunately you know it doesn't get the um doesn't get remembered the way that it should because you know in the same year the moon launch the moon landing and JFK and all these different things were happening around the world and I'm like that's not what why it was ignored mate it was a New Zealand Pakistan series that was played in Ducker right that's why it was ignored." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a>

3.  **India vs. [[englands_historic_2012_test_series_win_in_india | England]] (1971)**
    India's win in [[englands_historic_2012_test_series_win_in_india | England]] in 1971 is considered foundational for the future of cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:41:00">[30:41:00]</a>. Up until this point, India had been strong at home but hadn't assembled a top-quality team for away tours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:50:00">[30:50:00]</a>. The series, culminating in a slow, painful chase on the final day, held immense significance for India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:38:00">[31:38:00]</a>. Bhagwath Chandrasekhar's incredible performance at The Oval, taking many wickets, was crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:13:00">[31:13:00]</a>.

4.  **Australia vs. West Indies in the Caribbean (1995)**
    This series marked a significant "changing of the guard" in Test cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:02:00">[32:02:00]</a>. The West Indies had an unprecedented Test dynasty, largely undefeated for 19 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:09:00">[32:09:00]</a>. Australia's victory was massive as it ended this dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:14:00">[32:14:00]</a>. It was described as the closest Test cricket has come to a "heavyweight contest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:09:00">[34:09:00]</a>. Despite the West Indies still being "stacked" with talent, and Australia's team not yet fully formed, Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath's emergence was pivotal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:46:00">[32:46:00]</a>. This win heralded Australia's own period of dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:57:00">[33:57:00]</a>.

5.  **South Africa vs. [[englands_historic_2012_test_series_win_in_india | England]] (1935)**
    This series is historically important as it marked South Africa's resurgence in Test cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:55:00">[49:55:00]</a>. After winning their first two home series against [[englands_historic_2012_test_series_win_in_india | England]] on matting pitches, South Africa experienced a long period of struggle, including not winning a Test series in the 1920s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:01:00">[50:01:00]</a>. Their victory against a decent [[englands_historic_2012_test_series_win_in_india | England]] side in the 1930s, after their cricket had reportedly fallen to a low point, was significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:17:00">[51:17:00]</a>. This win signaled the point where South Africa started to consistently produce Test-quality batters and bowlers, becoming a formidable opponent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:30:00">[51:31:00]</a>.

*   India winning in Pakistan (2004), a well-remembered series for Virender Sehwag's triple century and Rahul Dravid's 270 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:58:00">[52:58:00]</a>.

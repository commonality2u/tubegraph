Episode 20 of the Crick Picks podcast delves into the challenging task of drafting the top five all-time Test all-rounders in history, with hosts Bam Kazi, Estelle Vasudan, and Jared Kimber participating in a snake-style draft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. The discussion highlighted the multifaceted nature of an all-rounder's role, considering not only statistical performance but also impact, athleticism, and adaptability across different cricketing eras.

## Top Picks and Their Legacies

### Garfield Sobers
Jared Kimber's first pick, Garfield Sobers, is considered by some to be the greatest all-rounder in cricket history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.
*   **Batting Prowess:** Averaged nearly 58 with the bat and is regarded as a top 10 batter of all time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. He held the highest individual score in Test cricket (365 not out) until Brian Lara broke it in 1994 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.
*   **Bowling Versatility:** Bowled left-arm finger spin, left-arm wrist spin, and was a very good swing bowler with a bowling average around 27-28 (estimated) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. His career bowling average was 34 due to his varied bowling styles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.
*   **Workload and Athleticism:** Sobers opened the bowling and bowled approximately 37 overs per game, a workload rarely seen in modern cricket for an all-rounder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. He was described as a brilliant athlete, potentially one of the best cricket has ever seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.
*   **Overall Impact:** Seen as a "natural entertainer" who just wanted to play cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. He took 235 wickets and scored over 8,000 runs in 93 Tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.

### Imran Khan
Bam Kazi's first pick was Imran Khan, who he would have chosen even with the first overall pick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.
*   **Peak Performance:** For a decade (1981-1991), Imran Khan averaged over 54 with the bat and under 20 with the ball, considered "the biggest peak we've ever seen in Test Cricket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.
*   **Career Stats:** Finished with a batting average of 37.7 and a bowling average of 22.8 in 88 Tests, taking 362 wickets and scoring nearly 4,000 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.
*   **Impact on Cricket:** He revolutionized Pakistan cricket, notably teaching [[comparison_of_cricket_legends | Wasim Akram]] and Waqar Younis reverse swing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>. His charismatic personality transcended the sport, making him a "sex symbol" in countries like Australia and England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.
*   **Captaincy:** Led Pakistan to their first Test series victories in England and India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>, and his own performance improved as captain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>.
*   **Comparison:** While his peak was immense, his earlier career was described as "just an average player" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>, which puts him slightly behind Sobers in terms of consistent greatness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>.

### Jacques Kallis
Estelle Vasudan selected Jacques Kallis, acknowledging his undeniable statistical excellence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>.
*   **Stats:** Amassed over 13,000 runs and 292 wickets, with a batting average of 55 in Test cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>. His batting average was higher than Sachin Tendulkar's, and his bowling average (32.65) was better than Zaheer Khan's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>.
*   **Role and Workload:** Kallis was often a fourth or fifth bowling option, bowling around 22 overs per game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>. This contrasts with Sobers' 37 overs per game, suggesting Kallis's workload was managed more carefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54:00]</a>.
*   **Comparison Across Eras:** It's posited that if Kallis had played in earlier eras (1950s-1980s), he might have bowled more and potentially surpassed Sobers or Imran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>. He played 166 Test matches, highlighting his longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>. His ability to average highly on South African wickets was also noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:19:00">[12:19:00]</a>.
*   **Batting Style:** He was a "world-class" batter, often among the top 3-5 in the world during his era, known for his perseverance against both pace and spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:24:00">[14:24:00]</a>.

### Richard Hadlee
Jared Kimber's second pick was Richard Hadlee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:30:00">[15:30:00]</a>.
*   **Bowling Dominance:** Known for his ridiculous bowling record, with 431 wickets at an average of 22.29 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52:00">[15:52:00]</a>. He had 36 five-wicket hauls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:55:00">[15:55:00]</a>. He was often considered the best bowler among his peers (Imran Khan, Kapil Dev, Ian Botham) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:00">[16:16:00]</a>.
*   **"One-Man Bowling Attack":** Hadlee bowled a very high volume of overs, similar to a spinner, which was unusual for a fast bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:16:00">[17:16:00]</a>.
*   **Batting:** His batting average was 27, with over 3,100 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:27:00">[16:27:00]</a>. However, his batting was considered more "handy" than truly great, with one of his two Test centuries being "essentially given to him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:03:00">[17:03:00]</a>. It's suggested his batting might have been more on reputation than consistent runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:31:00">[19:31:00]</a>.

### Ravindra Jadeja
Bam Kazi's second pick was Ravindra Jadeja, considered a "hot take" by some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:44:00">[19:44:00]</a>.
*   **Modern Stats:** Averaged 36 with the bat and 24 with the ball, a differential of 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:49:00">[19:49:00]</a>. He has 294 wickets and over 3,000 runs in 72 Tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:54:00">[19:54:00]</a>.
*   **Impact Player:** Described as "very very clutch," scoring important runs and acting as a partnership breaker with the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:02:00">[20:02:00]</a>. He also has a triple century in first-class cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:15:00">[20:15:00]</a>.
*   **Fielding:** Considered "arguably the best fielder in contemporary Cricket," adding a crucial "three-dimensional aspect" to his all-round ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:07:00">[20:07:00]</a>.
*   **Context:** His bowling is "brilliant" in Asian conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:18:00">[20:18:00]</a>. While considered a strong pick, some feel it might be "too early" to place him in the top five, though he is putting together an "incredible case" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:04:00">[21:04:00]</a>.

### Keith Miller
Jared Kimber chose Keith Miller, who has a similar record to Jadeja <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:17:00">[23:17:00]</a>.
*   **Role:** Opened the bowling and batted at number four, a unique combination among all-rounders outside of Sobers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:39:00">[23:39:00]</a>.
*   **Stats:** Averaged around 36-37 with the bat and 22-23 with the ball, taking 170 wickets in 55 Tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:23:00">[23:23:00]</a>. His average at number five was 42 from 2,000 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:56:00">[26:56:00]</a>.
*   **Athleticism and Context:** A "world-class athlete" who played professional Aussie Rules Football and was a professional jockey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:40:00">[24:40:00]</a>. His early prime was affected by World War II, causing him to miss three or four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:05:00">[25:05:00]</a>.
*   **Batting Style:** Famously "lazy" as a batter, often getting bored after reaching 50 if the opposition wasn't good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:51:00">[23:51:00]</a>. He had a strong "fear factor" for opponents due to his attacking style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:13:00">[27:13:00]</a>.

### Ian Botham
Jared Kimber's next pick was Ian Botham <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:04:00">[28:04:00]</a>.
*   **All-round Abilities:** Considered a "slightly more all-round cricketer" than Kapil Dev, with the potential to be a dashing number four batsman averaging low 40s and a "canny chaos bowler" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:08:00">[28:08:00]</a>.
*   **Stats:** Played 102 Tests, taking 383 wickets and scoring 5,200 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:20:00">[30:20:00]</a>.
*   **Athleticism and Lifestyle:** Another "incredible Next Level athlete" who was also a professional in two different sports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:21:00">[29:21:00]</a>. However, his performance was sometimes impacted by his off-field activities, leading to a "high ceiling" but "lower floor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:03:00">[29:03:00]</a>.
*   **Peak Performance:** His early career was among the greatest ever for an all-rounder in a 20-30 Test sample <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:00:00">[30:00:00]</a>.

### Ben Stokes
Bam Kazi chose Ben Stokes, a "hot take" due to his perceived "clutch" factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:01:00">[31:01:00]</a>.
*   **Stats:** Batting average of 35+, bowling average of 32 in 102 Tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:09:00">[31:09:00]</a>. He has 198 wickets and over 6,300 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:31:00">[31:31:00]</a>.
*   **Impact Player:** Described as perhaps the "most clutch cricketer of all time," capable of rescuing innings and breaking partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:06:00">[31:06:00]</a>. His performances in the Ashes, ODI, and T20 World Cup finals were cited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:57:00">[31:57:00]</a>.
*   **Revolutionary Style:** His captaincy has been praised for revolutionizing the game with "Bazball," introducing funky fields and aggressive scoring rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:42:00">[31:42:00]</a>.
*   **Role:** While not a primary bowler, he is considered one of the best "fifth bowlers" of all time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:13:00">[34:13:00]</a>.
*   **Resilience:** Overcame significant personal and career challenges, including conceding four sixes and a bar brawl incident, to become a leading figure in English cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:44:00">[35:44:00]</a>.

### Kapil Dev
Estelle Vasudan picked Kapil Dev, noting his longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:17:00">[36:17:00]</a>.
*   **Stats:** Played 131 Tests, scoring over 5,200 runs and taking 434 wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:27:00">[38:27:00]</a>. His batting average was 31.05 and bowling average was 29.64 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:44:00">[38:44:00]</a>.
*   **Impact:** He was India's first great seam bowler, a significant development for Indian cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:07:00">[39:07:00]</a>.
*   **Batting:** Despite a seemingly average batting average, he had 8 centuries and the ability to "change things" quickly, similar to Mitchell Starc making a century every 10 matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:50:00">[39:50:00]</a>.
*   **Workload:** He bowled around 40 overs per game, a heavy workload for a seam bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:58:00">[36:58:00]</a>.
*   **Comparison:** While his numbers might appear "numbers cricketer"-like to some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:23:00">[38:23:00]</a>, his impact and skill were substantial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:36:00">[39:36:00]</a>.

### Shakib Al Hasan
Estelle Vasudan's next pick was Shakib Al Hasan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:59:00">[41:59:00]</a>.
*   **Stats:** Batting average of nearly 39, bowling average of 31.16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:47:00">[42:47:00]</a>. Played 67 Tests, taking 237 wickets and scoring over 4,500 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:51:00">[42:51:00]</a>.
*   **Importance to Team:** He is the "greatest player" Bangladesh has ever produced and has consistently been their best batter and bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:25:00">[42:25:00]</a>.
*   **Impact:** He is the type of player opponents want to dismiss first due to his significant impact in any format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:35:00">[42:35:00]</a>.
*   **Underplayed:** It is considered an "injustice" that he has only played 67 Test matches, due to Bangladesh's limited Test schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:05:00">[43:05:00]</a>.
*   **Away Record:** His away batting average is 37 and bowling average is 31.7, showing strong performances outside of Bangladesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:47:00">[43:47:00]</a>.
*   **Skill-based All-rounder:** Unlike many athletic all-rounders, Shakib is more of a "skill-based" player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:24:00">[44:24:00]</a>.

### Andrew Flintoff
Bam Kazi's fourth pick was Andrew Flintoff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:42:00">[46:42:00]</a>.
*   **Stats:** Negative average differential (bowling average 31.77, batting average 31.79) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:52:00">[46:52:00]</a>. Played 79 Tests, taking 226 wickets and scoring over 3,800 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:53:00">[47:53:00]</a>.
*   **Impact:** A "mesmerizing cricketer" known for capturing the moment, particularly in the 2005 and 2009 Ashes series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:58:00">[46:58:00]</a>.
*   **Playing Style:** A "belligerent batter" and a fast bowler who could "crank it up" to 90 mph+ when fully fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:18:00">[47:18:00]</a>.
*   **Statistical Nuance:** His bowling average was impacted by his "dreadful" record against tail-enders, despite being one of the world's best bowlers against top-order batsmen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:00:00">[49:00:00]</a>.
*   **Talent vs. Fulfilment:** Had the talent to be the "best all-rounder of all time" if he had focused more on cricket rather than other pursuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:00:00">[50:00:00]</a>. Considered an "impact guy" rather than a "numbers guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:27:00">[50:27:00]</a>.

### Aubrey Faulkner
Jared Kimber's pick of Aubrey Faulkner was considered a "prehistoric pick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:53:00">[51:53:00]</a>.
*   **Unique Statistical Feat:** The only player in Test cricket to average more than 40 with the bat and less than 30 with the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:56:00">[51:56:00]</a>.
*   **Career Context:** Played few Tests because his career was interrupted by World War I, where he almost died <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:04:00">[52:04:00]</a>. He also fought in the Boer War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:12:00">[52:12:00]</a>.
*   **Versatility:** Started as a batter, then learned leg-spin and became a bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:22:00">[53:22:00]</a>. He was a brilliant batter in Australia and a brilliant bowler in South Africa and England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:09:00">[53:09:00]</a>.
*   **Impact:** At his best, he was among the top 3-4 batters in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:37:00">[53:37:00]</a>. He was one of the first players to use the "wrong'un" (googly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:56:00">[52:56:00]</a>. Like Shakib, he was his team's best batter and bowler in a relatively ordinary side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:51:00">[55:51:00]</a>.

### Tony Greig
Jared Kimber's final pick was Tony Greig <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:56:00">[56:56:00]</a>.
*   **Stats:** Averaged 40 with the bat and 32 with the ball in 58 Tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:08:00">[57:08:00]</a>. He also took 141 wickets and scored nearly 3,600 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:00:00">[58:00:00]</a>. In First-Class cricket, he took 856 wickets at 28 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:20:00">[57:20:00]</a>.
*   **Role:** A "proper fifth bowler" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:12:00">[57:12:00]</a>.
*   **Career Context:** His career for England was cut short because he left for World Series Cricket and never returned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:03:00">[57:07:00]</a>. He was a "rebellious cricketer," involved in World Series Cricket and the Indian Cricket League <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:27:00">[58:27:00]</a>.
*   **Physicality:** Described as "massive," around 6'5" or 6'6" tall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:16:00">[58:16:00]</a>.

### Shaun Pollock
Bam Kazi's final pick was Shaun Pollock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:19:00">[59:19:00]</a>.
*   **Stats:** Averaged over 32 with the bat and 23.11 with the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:27:00">[59:27:00]</a>. He took 421 wickets and scored nearly 3,800 runs in 108 Tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:42:00">[59:42:00]</a>. His average differential is nine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>.
*   **Bowling:** Considered one of South Africa's finest pacers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:31:00">[59:31:00]</a>.
*   **Batting:** His batting average of 32 was "criminally underrated," especially considering he often batted at number eight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. It's argued he could have averaged 33-34 at number seven if he played for a different team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:30">[01:00:30]</a>.
*   **Unfulfilled Potential:** He could have been a top three all-rounder, bowling at 90 mph+ and moving the ball both ways, and averaging 35-40 with the bat as a number seven, but his body deteriorated early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>.

### Chris Cairns
Estelle Vasudan's final pick was Chris Cairns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:07">[01:04:07]</a>.
*   **Stats:** Played 62 matches, scoring over 3,300 runs with five Test centuries and taking 218 wickets with 13 five-wicket hauls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:32">[01:04:32]</a>. His batting average was 33, but he was considered a much better player than that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:48">[01:04:48]</a>. His bowling average was better than 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:29">[01:05:29]</a>.
*   **Impact:** Had a similar impact to Ben Stokes, capable of quickly changing the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:04">[01:05:04]</a>. Known for hitting towering sixes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:15">[01:07:15]</a>.
*   **Away Performance:** His bowling average away from home was 30, showing he wasn't just a green-top specialist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:54">[01:05:54]</a>.

## Other Notable All-Rounders Discussed

The discussion also touched on other significant all-rounders who didn't make the immediate draft but were considered strong contenders:

*   **Trevor Goddard:** Averaged 35 with the bat and 26 with the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.
*   **Daniel Vettori:** Mentioned as a comparable player to Imran Khan's "knout merchant" batting style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a> and later as a player who missed out on the list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>.
*   **Vinoo Mankad:** Known for his significant impact, despite numbers that don't always "stack up" with others on the list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:15">[01:11:15]</a>.
*   **Richie Benaud:** His later career was "absolutely fantastic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:30">[01:15:30]</a>.
*   **Bowlers who could bat:** Players like Alan Davidson, [[comparison_of_cricket_legends | Shane Warne]], Mitchell Starc, and Pat Cummins were mentioned as having batting talent but perhaps not true all-rounder status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:27">[01:09:27]</a>. Warne's batting average was 18, but it was a "solid 18" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:37">[01:18:37]</a>.
*   **Wilfred Rhodes:** Averaged 30 with the bat and 27 with the ball over an astonishing 31-year career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:51">[01:09:51]</a>, including starting low in the order and ending as a top-order player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:24">[01:10:24]</a>.
*   **Wasim Akram:** Had a double century (257* vs Zimbabwe) and another century vs Australia in Adelaide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:58">[01:10:58]</a>, but his overall average was 22, likely "jacked up" by his high score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:09">[01:12:09]</a>.
*   **R. Ashwin:** Made the "long list," with his batting having "slipped off a little bit" recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:52">[01:12:52]</a>.
*   **Steve Waugh:** A "fantastic all-rounder" whose bowling record (92 wickets at 37) was impacted by injuries later in his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:27">[01:14:27]</a>.

## Conclusion

The selection of all-rounders highlights a blend of statistical dominance, impact, and athletic prowess across different eras. From the versatile genius of Sobers and the impactful peak of Imran Khan to the consistent longevity of Kallis and the clutch performances of Stokes, each player brought a unique dimension to the all-rounder role. The discussion also underscored the difficulty in comparing players across eras due to varying conditions, workloads, and game dynamics.

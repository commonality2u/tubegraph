India clinched their second T20 World Cup title by defeating South Africa in a thrilling final, becoming the first team to win the competition unbeaten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:56">[01:26:56]</a>. This victory ended India's 11-year [[Indias performance in ICC events | ICC title drought]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:45">[01:35:45]</a>. The achievement means that the recurring narrative around India's lack of ICC trophies can finally move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:07">[01:42:07]</a>.

## Key Performances and Moments

### Jasprit Bumrah: The Emperor of the Ball
Jasprit Bumrah was lauded as the "emperor" of the Indian team, with his performance often cited as the reason India won the final <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:17">[03:46:17]</a>. He was named Player of the Tournament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:39">[03:54:39]</a>. His bowling figures were exceptional:
*   2 for 20 against England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>
*   2 for 18 against South Africa in the final <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>
*   Gave away only six runs and took a wicket in his last two overs of the final <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>
*   Took 15 wickets in the tournament at an average of 8.26 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>
*   Struck at less than 12 deliveries per wicket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>
*   Maintained an economy rate of 4.17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>

It was suggested that it would have been a disservice to the sport if Bumrah had never won an ICC trophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. His performance in the final was described as "magnificent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>, particularly his first over against Heinrich Klaasen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. In his last 32 overs in T20 Internationals, he conceded more than 10 runs only twice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>.

### Suryakumar Yadav's Game-Changing Catch
Suryakumar Yadav's catch to dismiss David Miller in the final was considered a "game-finishing" and "tournament-winning" moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>. Despite controversy over whether his foot touched the boundary rope, replays did not provide conclusive evidence, and the decision stood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>. The composure shown by Suryakumar Yadav in taking the catch, irrespective of the controversy, made it iconic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25:00">[11:25:00]</a>.

### Arshdeep Singh's Ascent
Arshdeep Singh was the leading wicket-taker of the tournament with 17 wickets, tying with Fazalhaq Farooqi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. In the final, he took 2 for 20, including the crucial wickets of Aiden Markram and Quinton de Kock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. His penultimate over conceded only four runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. Despite having some expensive spells earlier in the tournament, he rose to the occasion in the final <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. His consistent wicket-taking ability makes him an automatic selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.

### Hardik Pandya's All-Round Brilliance
Hardik Pandya had an amazing tournament with both bat and ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. After a challenging year and criticism during the IPL, he delivered a clutch performance in the World Cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. His three for 20 in three overs in the final included the massive scalp of Heinrich Klaasen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. Hardik's mental strength and ability to break partnerships make him one of the first names on the team sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. When fully fit, he is considered a fine fifth bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.

### Virat Kohli's "Shindig" Innings
Virat Kohli was named Player of the Match for his innings of 76 off 59 deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. His innings had three phases:
1.  An attacking start, smashing 15 runs in Marco Jansen's first over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.
2.  A period of rebuilding after India lost early wickets, reaching his fifty off 48 deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.
3.  Acceleration towards the end, scoring his last 26 runs off just 10 deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.

His knock was dubbed "Shindig as Kohli," referring to its ambiguous nature â€“ it could have been criticized had India lost, but was applauded given the victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. It allowed India to put runs on the board and build pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. Kohli's decision to anchor the innings enabled other players to attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

### Axar Patel and Shivam Dube's Support
Axar Patel's promotion up the order was a tactical move by Rohit Sharma that paid off, as he scored a valuable 47 off 31 deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. Shivam Dube, despite facing criticism for his place in the team, smashed a perfect cameo of 26 off 17 deliveries, fulfilling his role even without facing spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. Their contributions were seen as having more impact than Kohli's innings in the final <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.

## India's Tournament Journey

India's path to the title was marked by dominance and evolution in their playing style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

### India vs. England Semi-Final
India convincingly defeated England by 68 runs in a one-sided semi-final in Guyana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.
*   **Bowling:** Kuldeep Yadav took 3 for 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>, Jasprit Bumrah took 2 for 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>, and Axar Patel stood out with 3 for 23, taking a wicket with his first delivery in each of his first three overs, including Jos Buttler first ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.
*   **Batting:** Rohit Sharma scored 57 off 39 deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>, and Suryakumar Yadav contributed 47 off 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>. These performances helped India post 171 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.
*   **Conditions:** The pitch in Guyana was slow and the ball was barely bouncing from the Pavilion end, making England's chase of 172 extremely difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. Rohit Sharma strategically bowled Bumrah from the media end, which was not affected by these conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

England's record in the tournament was described as "bang average," having only beaten West Indies among Test-playing nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. Their struggles against spin were a significant factor in their loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. Jos Buttler's decision to bat first after winning the toss on a challenging surface was questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

### Captaincy and Strategy
Both Rohit Sharma and Aiden Markram made mistakes in their captaincy in the final <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. However, Rohit was praised for fully trusting and backing his bowlers, a trait that distinguished India from South Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

## South Africa's Journey to the Final

South Africa reached the final after a dominant performance against Afghanistan.

### South Africa vs. Afghanistan Semi-Final
South Africa obliterated Afghanistan in Trinidad, bowling them out for 56 in 11.5 overs and chasing the total in 8.5 overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.
*   **Pitch Controversy:** The pitch in Trinidad was criticized as "dangerously inconsistent" and "not fit for a World Cup semi-final," resembling New York's challenging wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. It was called an "embarrassment to the ICC" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.
*   **Afghanistan's Batting:** Afghanistan was heavily reliant on their opening pair, Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Ibrahim Zadran, who had scored 57.2% of their team's runs in the tournament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>. Losing Gurbaz for a duck exposed their batting floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>. Azmatullah Omarzai was Afghanistan's highest scorer with 10 runs, but extras contributed 13 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>.
*   **South Africa's Bowling:** Marco Jansen took three wickets in the power play, Kagiso Rabada bowled a double-wicket maiden, and Anrich Nortje and Tabraiz Shamsi also took multiple wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>.

### The "Choke" Narrative for South Africa
When South Africa needed 30 runs off 30 deliveries and then 26 off 24 with six wickets in hand in the final, their subsequent loss by seven runs led to the "choke" narrative being applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. However, the discussion acknowledged nuance:
*   While South Africa lost from a winning position, it was primarily due to India's exceptional bowling, especially from Jasprit Bumrah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>.
*   South Africa's batting depth was seen as a weakness, particularly with Marco Jansen at number seven, creating issues once four wickets fell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.
*   The "choke" was described as "induced by going up against a ridiculously talented player" (Bumrah) rather than just a mental collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.

### Heinrich Klaasen's Record Innings
Heinrich Klaasen scored the fastest fifty ever in a T20 World Cup final <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>, ending with 52 off 27 deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. He attacked Axar Patel's over, smashing two fours and two sixes, which brought South Africa to a run-a-ball requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. His performance was nearly perfect, and he didn't deserve to be on the losing side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

## Tournament Overview

The T20 World Cup was largely characterized by low-scoring games and was described as "bowler-dependent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

### Controversies and Scheduling
Concerns were raised about the scheduling and lack of reserve days for semi-finals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>. Some commentators, like Michael Vaughan, suggested the tournament was "set up" for India to win due to fixed semi-final locations and time slots favoring the Indian market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>. However, these claims were dismissed as "nonsensical" because India would have been knocked out if they finished second in their group and the semi-final was rained out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. Also, the teams that made the final had to navigate challenging pitches in New York, a factor that put Indian and South African batters at a disadvantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

### Afghanistan's Historic Semi-Final Berth
Afghanistan's run to the semi-finals was a "massive moment" for their cricketing history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>. They defeated New Zealand and Australia, despite being a team heavily reliant on a few key players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. Their dramatic win against Bangladesh, described as a "wildly stupidly entertaining fixture," secured their spot in the semi-finals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. This match featured comical running between wickets, a bat throw from Rashid Khan, and Gulbadin Naib faking a hamstring injury to influence the DLS method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. Rashid Khan scored an unbeaten 19 off 10 and took 4 for 23, while Naveen-ul-Haq took 4 for 26 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. Jonathan Trott was credited for his fantastic coaching of the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

## Notable Retirements

Following India's World Cup victory, several prominent Indian players announced their retirement from T20 International cricket.
*   **Virat Kohli** and **Rohit Sharma** announced their retirements, signing off in style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. Both are batting "behemoths" who scored over 4,000 runs each in the format for India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.
*   **Ravindra Jadeja** also retired from T20Is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.
*   **Rahul Dravid**, in his final assignment as India's head coach, also signed off with a World Cup title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. His calm and collected mindset and focus on winning the cup for themselves, rather than for specific individuals, were praised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. His coaching tenure is seen as cementing his status as an Indian legend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.

This marks the end of a generation of players moving on from T20 International cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

Data analytics has become an increasingly vital component in modern sports, fundamentally changing how teams understand strategy, evaluate performance, and make decisions. This is particularly evident in cricket, where sophisticated data analysis, including [[advanced_data_analysis_in_cricket_including_ball_revolutions | ball revolutions]] and tracking data, provides unprecedented insights for [[role_of_analysts_in_cricket | analysts]] and coaches.

## Early Forays into Cricket Data Analysis

Himanish Ganju, a cosmologist and former analyst for the Indian men's cricket team, began his journey into [[analyzing_cricket_data | cricket data analysis]] in 2015 when he was curious about basic questions, such as how batting averages had changed in Test cricket over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:52">[06:22:52]</a>. He learned Python and how to gather databases from various sources to investigate these questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:08">[06:38:08]</a>.

### The Axar Patel Anomaly

A pivotal moment in Ganju's analytical work was his deep dive into the performance of cricketer Axar Patel following the 2021 England Series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:64">[02:05:64]</a>. He observed that Patel bowled wide of the crease and didn't turn the ball much, yet was highly effective at taking wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:47">[02:09:47]</a>. This led Ganju to investigate the data, where he discovered Patel was "really different and really anomalous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:78">[01:42:78]</a>.

The process of developing such an analytical piece typically involves:
*   Starting with a "triggering question" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:72">[02:45:72]</a>.
*   Formulating it in terms of numbers and building metrics to investigate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.
*   Looking at the data to find narratives or "arcs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.

This particular article, which took two to three weeks from conception to writing, was notable for its use of [[advanced_data_analysis_in_cricket_including_ball_revolutions | Hawkeye data]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. It was published on Ganju's Substack due to uncertainties about using Hawkeye data on Cricinfo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>, and it gained significant traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. The piece was described as a "seminal" contribution to understanding cricket, changing how people think about how a bowler takes wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>, providing a "new prism into the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:32:00">[14:32:00]</a>.

### Leveraging Hawkeye Data

[[advanced_data_analysis_in_cricket_including_ball_revolutions | Hawkeye data]] has been instrumental in moving beyond traditional cricketing clich√©s and "vibes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:04:00">[15:04:00]</a>. It allows for rigorous, data-backed insights, such as precisely defining a "good length" delivery or tracking how bowlers adjust their lengths over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>. For example, it revealed that the optimal "good length" has shifted from 6-8 meters to 5-7 meters in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:48:00">[15:48:00]</a>. This data-driven approach helps validate observations and understand *why* certain phenomena exist in the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:24:00">[16:24:00]</a>.

## Role as Analyst for the Indian Men's Cricket Team

Ganju's Axar Patel video eventually reached Rahul Dravid, the coach of the Indian men's cricket team, leading to Ganju's appointment as a consultant analyst in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:43:00">[16:43:00]</a>. Dravid was particularly interested in how Ganju looked at the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:48:00">[19:48:00]</a> and wanted to leverage [[technology_and_data_in_cricket_training | tracking data]] to better understand bowlers and batters, an area where the team wasn't heavily focused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:31:00">[20:31:00]</a>.

### Confidentiality and Role Definition

The role was kept secret due to its high-profile and sensitive nature, aiming to "cut out the noise" and prevent information leakage or public pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:20:00">[24:20:00]</a>. Ganju's public profile as a writer also necessitated this secrecy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:43:00">[24:43:00]</a>, leading him to significantly reduce his public commentary on Indian cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:14:00">[27:14:00]</a>.

As a "shadow analyst" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:07:00">[28:07:00]</a>, Ganju's interaction with players was limited, primarily to Rohit Sharma (the captain) and R. Ashwin (who had read his earlier article) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:05:00">[33:05:00]</a>. The team management adopted a strategy where Ganju's research and insights would first go to the coaches, who would then decide how to communicate it to the players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:32:00">[30:32:00]</a>. This approach prevented "muddling the players with numbers or with research" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:51:00">[30:51:00]</a>.

### The World Cup Experience

Being an analyst for a national team, especially one with a massive following like India, brings immense pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:15:00">[28:15:00]</a>. Ganju described it as a "highly scary place to be in" due to the scrutiny on the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:19:00">[28:19:00]</a>.

The experience of losing two World Cups (T20 World Cup in 2022 and ODI World Cup in 2023) as an insider provided a different perspective compared to being a fan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:58:00">[33:58:00]</a>. He learned that every decision has numerous underlying reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:23:00">[34:23:00]</a> and that players are accustomed to winning and losing regularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:04:00">[35:04:00]</a>. This emotional detachment became a coping mechanism, where he would send his research days before a game and then disengage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:31:00">[38:31:00]</a>.

However, the satisfaction of seeing data-driven plans work in real-time, such as the [[cricket_analysis_and_strategic_decisionmaking_in_highpressure_games | Heinrich Klaasen wicket]] in the 2024 T20 World Cup final (a white slower ball that was discussed before the match) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:37:00">[43:37:00]</a>, was unparalleled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:27:00">[40:27:00]</a>. This collaboration, where an outsider's insights are valued by top players and coaches, validates the utility of data in competitive environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:12:00">[41:12:00]</a>.

The most significant contribution, beyond the World Cup win itself, was the shift in team culture towards consistently [[strategy_and_decisionmaking_in_cricket | leveraging data for every decision]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:22:00">[49:22:00]</a>. This commitment to being the "most knowledgeable Team Management," using data to understand aspects like ball speed, angles of hit, and shot effectiveness, became a source of pride for Ganju <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:24:00">[50:24:00]</a>. Rahul Dravid, despite the public narrative, was considered a "radical" and "forward-thinking" coach in his approach to T20 cricket and understanding the game at a deep level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:48:00">[47:48:00]</a>.

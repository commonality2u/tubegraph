Shoaib Malik, a veteran cricketer who debuted for Pakistan in 1999, has recently joined the [[management_and_structural_issues_within_pakistan_cricket | Pakistan Cricket Board]] ([[management_and_structural_issues_within_pakistan_cricket | PCB]]) as a [[role_and_responsibilities_of_mentors_in_pakistan_cricket | mentor]] for a domestic team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. His appointment is part of a new initiative aimed at addressing long-standing issues of [[professionalism_in_cricket | professionalism]] and inconsistency within [[challenges_and_opportunities_for_pakistan_cricket | Pakistan cricket]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Historical Challenges
For years, [[challenges_and_opportunities_for_pakistan_cricket | Pakistan cricket]] has been plagued by a lack of clarity, leading to inconsistent results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Frequent changes in chairman, selectors, and coaches at high frequency have destabilized the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## The New Mentor Initiative
In an effort to bring consistency, the [[management_and_structural_issues_within_pakistan_cricket | PCB]] has introduced a new Champions tournament and hired five [[role_and_responsibilities_of_mentors_in_pakistan_cricket | mentors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. These [[role_and_responsibilities_of_mentors_in_pakistan_cricket | mentors]] are given significant authority over the selected 30-35 players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

### Redefining the Mentor Role
Unlike typical franchise cricket [[role_and_responsibilities_of_mentors_in_pakistan_cricket | mentor]] roles, which often involve minimal engagement, the [[management_and_structural_issues_within_pakistan_cricket | PCB]]'s [[role_and_responsibilities_of_mentors_in_pakistan_cricket | mentor]] positions are comprehensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   **Contract & Commitment:** It's a three-year contract requiring 240 days of work annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, mostly at five high-performance centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Expanded Responsibilities:** [[role_and_responsibilities_of_mentors_in_pakistan_cricket | Mentors]] are involved in coaching, tactics, and player selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. They also have the authority to select their own support staff, including spin bowling, pace bowling coaches, physios, and trainers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Veteran Leadership:** Four out of five [[role_and_responsibilities_of_mentors_in_pakistan_cricket | mentors]], including Younis Khan, Misbah-ul-Haq, Shoaib Malik, and Sarfaraz Ahmed, have captained [[challenges_and_opportunities_for_pakistan_cricket | Pakistan cricket]] teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

### Instilling Professionalism
The core objective is to groom players and provide them with the best facilities to improve not only their skills but also their [[professionalism_in_cricket | professionalism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. This extends beyond on-field performance to encompass:
*   **Recovery and Consistency:** Guiding players on how to recover from games and maintain [[pakistans_cricket_strategy_and_performance_issues | consistency]] through back-to-back matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
*   **Physical Well-being:** Implementing proper exercise routines, training schedules, and crucial diet and nutritionist plans, emphasizing that physical recovery is as vital as skill development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   **Life Skills:** Promoting a disciplined life, including off-field aspects like managing personal affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, to ensure players are well-rounded professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a>.

The program targets various teams, including men's, women's, and U19 sides, aiming for [[pakistans_cricket_strategy_and_performance_issues | consistent results]] across all levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

## Talent vs. Discipline
While [[challenges_and_opportunities_for_pakistan_cricket | Pakistan]] has abundant talent, talent alone cannot guarantee [[pakistans_cricket_strategy_and_performance_issues | consistency]] or trophy wins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. The focus has shifted from merely identifying talent to grooming players to be disciplined and professional athletes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Younis Khan's success as the only Pakistani cricketer to score 10,000 Test runs is cited as an example of hard work and work ethic overriding raw talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

## Bridging the Domestic-International Gap
The Champions tournaments are designed to reduce the significant difference in [[professionalism_in_cricket | professionalism]] and work ethic between domestic and national cricketers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. Future plans include reducing the number of domestic tournaments from next year to ensure players get adequate rest and time for personal development and skill improvement during off-season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.

### Evolution of Player Selection
In the recent past, many new players were selected for the national team based solely on their performance in T20 cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. This led to struggles in ODI and Test cricket, where players faced more varied match situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>. The new approach emphasizes selecting players who perform [[pakistans_cricket_strategy_and_performance_issues | consistently]] in 4-day and 1-day formats for at least a season or two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>.

## Clarity in Policies and Governance
A major hurdle has been the lack of clarity in [[management_and_structural_issues_within_pakistan_cricket | PCB]] policies, especially regarding No-Objection Certificates (NOCs) for players participating in global leagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. This has deterred foreign franchises from picking Pakistani cricketers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>.

Shoaib Malik, having built much of his [[professionalism_in_cricket | professionalism]] by playing over 500 T20 games globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>, advocates for allowing players to participate in leagues during free windows, provided they prioritize domestic tournaments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:34">[00:27:34]</a>. He emphasizes that exposure to different cultures and playing conditions helps players become more professional and self-reliant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:39">[00:28:39]</a>.

The [[management_and_structural_issues_within_pakistan_cricket | PCB]] aims to provide clear schedules for domestic tournaments and international tours by 2027 to facilitate better planning for both players and the board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:45">[00:31:45]</a>.

## [[involvement_of_experienced_players_in_cricket_administration | Role of Cricketers in Administration]]
To overcome the "amateur" way the [[management_and_structural_issues_within_pakistan_cricket | PCB]] has often been run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:54">[00:35:54]</a>, there's a strong belief that more [[involvement_of_experienced_players_in_cricket_administration | cricketers]] should be integrated into the board's setup, especially in key roles like International Director <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>. Having [[involvement_of_experienced_players_in_cricket_administration | cricketers]] in these positions would ensure better decision-making, particularly concerning pitch preparation for home series, and foster better communication between players and the board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:43">[00:36:43]</a>. The current chairman is noted for being accessible to players, which is seen as a positive step towards greater clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.

Furthermore, a critical suggestion involves implementing a "mix and match" strategy for international tours. When touring strong cricketing nations, the main team should play. However, when playing against smaller sides or hosting home series, a blend of senior and new players should be used to provide international exposure to newcomers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a>. This approach also helps manage the workload of fast bowlers, ensuring they remain fresh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>.

## Babar Azam's Batting Adjustments
Shoaib Malik shared insights into adjustments made by [[pakistans_batting_performance_critique | Babar Azam]] to improve his batting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:55">[00:42:55]</a>:
*   **Against Spin:** [[pakistans_batting_performance_critique | Babar Azam]] was advised to change his stance from middle stump to leg stump against spinners. This adjustment eliminates the leg-before-wicket (LBW) element, allowing him to play more freely, especially against mystery spinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:55">[00:43:55]</a>.
*   **Against Pace:** For faster bowlers (140+ km/h), work was done on ensuring his back leg moves properly when playing off the back foot, as he was previously trying to manage everything on the front foot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:35">[00:44:35]</a>.

These changes were adopted by [[pakistans_batting_performance_critique | Babar Azam]] in practice and have been instrumental in his renewed [[pakistans_cricket_strategy_and_performance_issues | consistency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:07">[00:45:07]</a>. Malik emphasized that even top professionals should be open to advice and continuously learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:16">[00:47:16]</a>.

Following his resignation from white-ball captaincy, [[pakistans_batting_performance_critique | Babar Azam]] is expected to focus solely on his batting, potentially leading to even greater [[pakistans_cricket_strategy_and_performance_issues | consistency]] and match-winning performances for [[challenges_and_opportunities_for_pakistan_cricket | Pakistan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:27">[00:48:27]</a>.

## Conclusion
The current initiatives within [[challenges_and_opportunities_for_pakistan_cricket | Pakistan cricket]], particularly the emphasis on player development through the new [[role_and_responsibilities_of_mentors_in_pakistan_cricket | mentor]] roles and structured domestic tournaments, aim to cultivate a culture of [[professionalism_in_cricket | professionalism]]. Sustained [[pakistans_cricket_strategy_and_performance_issues | consistency]] in implementation of these [[structure_and_governance_of_pakistan_cricket | structures]] and transparent communication from the [[management_and_structural_issues_within_pakistan_cricket | PCB]] are crucial for achieving long-term success and nurturing future talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.

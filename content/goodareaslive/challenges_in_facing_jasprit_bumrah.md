From: [[goodareaslive]] <br/> 

Jasprit Bumrah's recent performance has been described as a "freakish" and "other-worldly" peak, making him one of the most challenging bowlers to face in contemporary cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Since returning from injury, he has taken 74 wickets in 31 international matches across formats, averaging less than 16 runs per wicket and maintaining an economy rate under four runs per over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. He consistently strikes at a rate of a wicket every 25 deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. His dominance transcends game formats, playing conditions, and phases of the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Unprecedented Dominance and Comparisons
Bumrah's current form is considered one of the greatest peaks by any bowler, particularly when considering his [[jasprit_bumrahs_impact_in_all_cricket_formats | impact across all formats]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. While there have been other bowlers with exceptional periods, such as Waqar Younis, Dale Steyn, and the West Indian "Four Horsemen" of the 1980s, Bumrah's all-format dominance is rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

[[comparisons_of_jasprit_bumrah_with_other_fast_bowlers | Comparisons to other bowlers]] like Mitchell Starc and Glenn McGrath during World Cups, or Muttiah Muralitharan and Shane Warne in their peak wicket-taking years, highlight Bumrah's unique position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. While bowlers like Muralitharan, McGrath, and Allan Donald had years with over 100 international wickets at low averages, the landscape of international cricket was different, lacking the demands of tournaments like the IPL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Bumrah's impact is clear even if his sheer wicket volume doesn't always match these historical figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## [[jasprit_bumrahs_unique_bowling_techniques | Unique Bowling Techniques]]
A primary challenge for batsmen stems from Bumrah's highly unconventional and [[challenges_faced_by_unconventional_bowlers_in_cricket | outlier action]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
*   **Closer Release Point**: Bumrah delivers the ball approximately half a meter closer to the batsman than most other bowlers, effectively shortening the pitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. This causes the ball to feel quicker, even if his pace is lower than other express bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. This reduction in reaction time is a significant advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
*   **Short and Unorthodox Run-up**: His short and unusual run-up provides batters with less time to gather information about the delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. Unlike conventional actions that batsmen are accustomed to seeing from a young age, Bumrah's unique motion creates uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

## Exceptional Accuracy and Variations
Bumrah's control over his variations and lengths is an extremely rare skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. While accurate bowlers like Vernon Philander, Glenn McGrath, or Mohammad Asif could maintain a designated length all day, Bumrah has multiple specific lengths for his different variations, which he nails consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. He possesses about five distinct lengths he can bowl effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.

*   **Diverse Arsenal**: His back-of-a-length delivery curbs run-scoring, his length balls are potent wicket-takers, and his Yorkers are devastating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. Even his "bad" deliveries, like slot balls (economy 7.5) and full tosses (economy 5.5), are difficult to score off, making him challenging even when he makes mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. This is partly due to his action already rushing batters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.

## Impact Beyond Wickets
Bumrah's "gravitational force" on the game is immense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. He significantly influences the scoring patterns and wicket-taking of other bowlers.

*   **Assisted Wickets**: He ranks highly in "assisted wickets" in the IPL, meaning wickets that fall on the delivery immediately following his over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>. This occurs because batsmen intentionally play him out, building pressure that they then release against the next bowler, often leading to dismissals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>.
*   **Strategic Planning**: Teams often plan their batting strategy around Bumrah, knowing that scoring will be incredibly difficult during his overs, particularly the 17th and 19th in T20s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. This forces batters to "throw the kitchen sink" at the overs surrounding his spell, further increasing the chance of wickets for other bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>.

## Unplayable in T20 Cricket
Bumrah is particularly unplayable in T20 cricket. Since returning from injury, in T20 Internationals for India, he has taken 15 wickets in eight games with an average of 8.73 and an economy rate of 4.24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. In his last 24 overs for India, he has conceded more than 10 runs only twice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

During the 2024 IPL, the highest-scoring T20 tournament ever, Bumrah played 13 games, took 20 wickets, and maintained an economy rate of 6.5, averaging under 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. This performance in a batting-friendly environment underscores his exceptional control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. [[comparisons_of_jasprit_bumrah_with_other_fast_bowlers | Compared to Lasith Malinga]], considered one of the greatest T20 bowlers, Bumrah has a better true economy in 75% of an IPL game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. Crucially, Bumrah goes for fewer runs than Malinga in the last three overs of an IPL game, despite Malinga being a death-over specialist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

## Batters' Struggles
Batters find it exceptionally difficult to score against Bumrah with most shots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.
*   **Pull Shot Difficulty**: In the 2024 IPL, batters attempting the pull shot against Bumrah averaged just 10 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>.
*   **High Range, Low Effectiveness**: Even batters with a wide range of shots, like Glenn Maxwell, score quickly but get out frequently to Bumrah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. Few batters have consistently good records against him, and those who do, like Dinesh Karthik or Pat Cummins, often find limited boundary options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.

## Evolution of Fast Bowling
Bumrah is a disruptor who is helping the game evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a>. His exceptional wrist work, similar to Mustafizur Rahman ("the Fizz"), represents the next evolution of fast bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:28">[00:34:28]</a>. He combines the traditional skills of a fast bowler—seam, wobble, reverse swing—with skills typically associated with spin bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a>. For example, he can set up a tailender like an off-spinner using bouncers to manipulate their position before bowling a different delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[00:37:08]</a>.

Bumrah's ability to bowl effectively even within himself, at speeds between 130 to 140 km/h, further highlights his control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>. When he wants to simply restrict scoring, he can "coast" at these medium speeds, knowing batters still cannot score off him effectively due to his unique release and accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08">[00:31:08]</a>. This contrasts with bowlers like Dale Steyn or Waqar Younis, who often bowled at their physical limit to be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a>.

## Conclusion
Jasprit Bumrah is considered the best contemporary all-format cricketer, especially among bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>. His [[jasprit_bumrahs_performance_across_formats | performance across formats]] is unmatched, as no other bowler has dominated all three forms of the game in the same way he currently is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:15">[00:41:15]</a>. Despite the typical overrating of Indian cricketers, Bumrah may still be underrated due to being initially known as a T20 bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:03">[00:41:03]</a>. His ability to combine the best attributes of bowlers like Glenn McGrath (accuracy) and Mitchell Starc (pace) in one package makes him a truly unique and formidable opponent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:26">[00:44:26]</a>. The only remaining question about his legacy is his longevity and consistent play to reach the highest wicket-taking milestones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:35">[00:41:35]</a>.

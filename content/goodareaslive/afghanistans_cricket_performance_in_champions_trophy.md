Afghanistan is participating in its first-ever Champions Trophy tournament, marking a significant milestone in their cricketing journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:20">[01:09:20]</a>. Their debut campaign has been characterized by strategic play, resilience, and notable individual performances.

## Tournament Highlights

### First Victory
Afghanistan secured their first-ever Champions Trophy fixture win by defeating England in Lahore by eight runs, an outcome that also knocked England out of the tournament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:54">[01:10:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:26">[01:14:26]</a>. This victory followed their earlier win against England in the ODI World Cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20">[02:20]</a>.

### Strategic Approach
Afghanistan prefers to bat first in ODIs, aiming to set a challenging total and then defend it with their bowling attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13">[05:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01">[06:01]</a>. They are confident in defending totals, particularly against teams like England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21">[05:21]</a>. This strategy allows them to play to their strengths and overcome conditions, even when dew is a factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37">[05:37]</a>.

Head coach Jonathan Trott has been credited with influencing the team's batting strategy, shifting from erratic scoring to a more consistent approach where top-order batters aim to build a strong foundation around 200 runs for three wickets, allowing later attackers to capitalize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:41">[20:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:40">[56:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:01">[57:01]</a>.

## Key Player Performances

### Ibrahim Zadran
Ibrahim Zadran has been a standout performer for Afghanistan:
*   He was named Player of the Match against England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49">[02:49]</a>.
*   His score of 177 runs off 146 balls against England is the highest-ever by an Afghan batter in ODI cricket, surpassing his own previous record of 160 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56">[02:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03">[03:03]</a>.
*   It is also the highest individual score in Champions Trophy history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07">[03:07]</a>.
*   Zadran demonstrated maturity by soaking in pressure against high pace and then capitalizing on opportunities, striking the ball well all around the wicket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17">[03:17]</a>.
*   He is considered to be on the verge of becoming an automatic run-scorer in ODI cricket, known for his smart play, great technique, and ability to avoid mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44">[03:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54">[03:54]</a>.
*   He scored a century against Australia in the 2023 World Cup match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41">[04:41]</a>.

### Azmatullah Omarzai
Azmatullah Omarzai, often compared to Hardik Pandya due to his all-round skill set, has also been crucial:
*   He was named ODI Player of the Year in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42">[07:42]</a>.
*   Against England, he took his maiden five-wicket haul (5 for 58) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51">[07:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55">[07:55]</a>.
*   He also contributed 41 runs off 31 balls with the bat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57">[07:57]</a>.
*   Omarzai bowls with the new ball and is expected to bowl at the death, showcasing incredible talent despite not being a fully "finished" bowler yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21">[08:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24">[08:24]</a>.
*   His power-hitting game is effective, though he has a weakness against short-pitched bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03">[09:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07">[09:07]</a>.

### Other Notable Contributions
*   **Mohammad Nabi:** Continues to be an important player, contributing with regular wickets and handy runs. He has struck with the first ball of his spell twice in two games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07">[03:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:10">[30:10]</a>. His power-hitting game has improved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:18">[30:18]</a>.
*   **Rahmat Shah:** Showed improved scoring rate, making 90 runs off 92 balls against South Africa, contrasting his usual slower pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:33">[22:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:41">[22:41]</a>.
*   **Gulbadin Naib:** Played a role, even bowling a "bunch of tripe" to get a wicket against England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:16">[31:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:18">[31:18]</a>.
*   **Hashmatullah Shahidi:** As captain, he provides experience and stability, focusing on not losing wickets early to allow the team to reach a strong position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:14">[56:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:33">[56:33]</a>.

## Areas for Improvement

*   **Death Bowling:** Afghanistan is not considered a very good death bowling side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18">[04:18]</a>.
*   **Fielding:** The team is not a highly skilled fielding side, sometimes dropping catches, including a "dolly" by Hashmatullah Shahidi early in the England match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32">[04:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52">[03:52]</a>.
*   **Rashid Khan's Form:** Rashid Khan has not had a good tournament so far, averaging around 50 with the ball and struggling to find his rhythm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:51">[01:08:51]</a>. He tends to bowl too quickly on these surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:45">[01:09:45]</a>.
*   **Rahmanullah Gurbaz's Contribution:** The explosive opener has not yet "turned up" in the Champions Trophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:43">[01:08:43]</a>.

## Champions Trophy Outlook

Afghanistan currently has two points in their group and needs to win their next match against Australia to secure a place in the semi-finals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:04">[01:10:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:28">[38:28]</a>. They have made a T20 World Cup semi-final recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:27">[01:09:27]</a> and could have reached the semi-final in the ODI World Cup if not for [[Australias performance and challenges in the World Cup 2023 match against Afghanistan|Glenn Maxwell's]] exceptional innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:31">[01:09:31]</a>.

There is a sense that Afghanistan is upping their game, even against strong pace attacks, as seen in their match against South Africa where Rahmat Shah scored quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18">[02:18]</a>.

The team's potential for a deep run in the tournament is high, and they are not afraid to face teams like Australia, having beaten them in a previous T20 World Cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:14">[01:10:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>. The upcoming match against Australia is expected to be a crucial determinant for their semi-final hopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:04">[01:10:04]</a>.

The 4th Test match between India and England proved to be more entertaining than initially anticipated, concluding with India securing a 3-1 series victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. The series overall has been described as "full of madness and entertainment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, featuring personal injuries, pregnancies, DRS incidents, close matches, wild swings, and new players stepping up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Only about 10 five-Test series in history have gone 3-2, making the tension at 3-1 after four Tests quite special <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## Match Highlights and Key Moments
The final day began with James Anderson bowling a maiden over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. India initially looked comfortable for about eight overs, with the pitch appearing fine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. However, the wicket seemed to change after Yashasvi Jaiswal's dismissal, with Rohit Sharma following soon after <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Devdutt Padikkal's struggles continued, and the pitch began to look "spiteful" as the ball remained hard, putting India in danger of giving the game back to England for the second time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

After lunch, a full toss led to another dismissal at short mid-wicket, followed by another wicket on the very next ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Despite the tension, the match "fizzled out a little bit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## England's Batting Approach
England's runs per over in this match was 3.13, a significant deviation from their usual "Bazball" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Prior to this game, England had not scored below 3.5 runs an over since the very first Bazball game when they were still deciding on their commitment to the style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. The team did not play this match with a full Bazball mentality, which is seen as a sign of respect for adapting to different game methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

Brendon McCullum has often spoken about the need to use both Bazball and traditional cricket methods, a philosophy he embodied as a player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. The pitch, along with a partnership between Joe Root and Ben Foakes and a subsequent collapse in the third innings, played a role in England's slower scoring rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

### The Third Innings "Pickle"
The "third innings pickle" refers to a situation where a team is ahead or even at the halfway point of a game and struggles to decide whether to attack or accumulate runs, leading to confusion and often insufficient runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. This concept, coined by commentator Johnny Bairstow, is frequently observed in first-class cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. While England has been strong in fourth-innings chases, the "key of Bazball" might lie in their approach to the third innings, both while bowling and batting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. In the last two games, England has been "completely outplayed" in the third innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

## Player Analysis
### Shubman Gill's Innings Performance
Shubman Gill displays an unusual statistical pattern in his first-class career, with his average being significantly lower in the first innings (37) compared to later innings: 51 in the second, 61 in the third, and 48 in the fourth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. This is counter-intuitive for a player who thrives on flat pitches in white-ball cricket, as he seems to perform better in red-ball cricket when conditions are tougher or the pace is different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Despite looking assured early on, Gill was 8 off 28 balls, and the commentator noted that if he had gotten out then, his assured start would not have been remembered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

His performance in this match, where he looked more comfortable than even Rohit Sharma while batting well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>, further supported the idea that he excels when the wicket is not at its freshest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Gill's talent is widely acknowledged, and his ability to perform in difficult situations makes him a valuable asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

### Rohit Sharma's Fourth Innings Record
Today's 50 was only Rohit Sharma's second half-century ever in the fourth innings of a first-class match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. While batters play less in the fourth innings, this record is still considered "absolutely remarkable," especially given he has passed 50 sixty-three times in the first part of games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

### Dhruv Jurel's Performance
Dhruv Jurel also performed well in the fourth innings despite not having a strong prior record in such situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. He came in when the ball was softer but also under significant pressure, facing a hat-trick ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

### Challenges of Chasing in India
India's success in chasing 150+ in the fourth innings is rare; excluding the Gabba Test, their record since 2013 stands at 1 win, 10 losses, and 5 draws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. This highlights the difficulty of chasing in Indian conditions, which include cracks, inconsistent bounce, and natural pitch deterioration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.

## Umpiring Controversy
A particular decision involving Yashasvi Jaiswal, where third umpire Joel Wilson gave him not out due to perceived bat involvement, caused discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. The sound wave suggested a low sound, and video showed the bat flicking the pad with a clear gap to the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. Wilson appeared to miss the bat hitting the pad and interpreted the sound as an edge, which also occurred in Joe Root's dismissal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.

### Call for Specialist Third Umpires
This incident led to a call for specialist third umpires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>. Joel Wilson has served as a third umpire in only 22% of his 511 professional umpiring performances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. The argument is that third umpiring requires a specific understanding of technology, collaboration with broadcast teams, and the ability to request specific camera angles, skills not extensively developed by traditional standing umpires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. Having dedicated, full-time third umpires with consistent technical support teams could lead to quicker and more accurate decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:29">[00:39:29]</a>.

## Series Context and "Bazball" Discussion
The series' unpredictability has been a boon for cricket media, generating headlines whether England succeeds or fails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>. Despite the excitement, it's widely believed that England was not favored to win the series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56">[00:31:56]</a>. The England team themselves harbored doubts, anticipating a difficult series against a stronger India side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:29">[00:33:29]</a>. However, their win in the first Test generated a sense of possibility and "daydreaming" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a>.

England's transformation under "Bazball" is significant, given their struggles before its implementation, including a loss to West Indies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:58">[00:33:58]</a>. The influence of Bazball is already visible, with India employing some of its field placement theories and Rohit Sharma executing aggressive shots previously associated with this style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:37">[00:48:37]</a>. Without Bazball, it's suggested England would have lost this series by a much larger margin, possibly 6-0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:17">[00:49:17]</a>.

The series showcased India's ability to come back from behind, attributed to the overall strength of the team and the impressive performance of younger players like Jurel and Kuldeep Yadav <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>.

### Evolution of Cricket
Modern cricket allows players to adapt their game across different gears, transitioning between defensive Test play, aggressive T20 hitting, and ODI accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:59">[00:59:59]</a>. Dhruv Jurel is cited as a prime example of this adaptability, capable of not scoring against bowlers like Anderson in one period, then attacking him in another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a>. This evolution, including innovations like reverse swing and the "wrong'un" delivery, continuously makes the sport better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:47">[01:01:47]</a>.

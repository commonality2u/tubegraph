[[Australias cricket strategy and performance in ODI World Cup 2023 | Australia's performance in the 2023 ODI World Cup]] was marked by a significant evolution from their initial struggles to a dominant display in the final against India. Their success stemmed from key tactical adjustments, improved execution, and superior reading of conditions, particularly in the knockout stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

## Evolution and Initial Form

At the start of the tournament, the [[Australias team composition and match strategy | Australian team]] faced skepticism, even from within its own ranks, regarding their form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>. Key players like Adam Zampa, Pat Cummins, and Mitchell Starc were not performing particularly well, with Glenn Maxwell ironically being their best bowler early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. A significant factor in their transformation was the return of Travis Head, whose ability to score at a strike rate of 120 while averaging over 60 was deemed crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. The team that faced India in the final had significantly evolved from the unit they lost to in Chennai nine games prior, showcasing a "very different team from the start to the end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

## Fielding and Intensity

Early in the tournament, Australia's fielding was "lackluster," characterized by allowing easy singles and having all fielders back on the edge of the circle, a "very 2015 style ODI cricket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. This defensive approach was notable given Pat Cummins' captaincy style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

However, as the tournament progressed, especially from the semi-finals against South Africa and into the final, Australia's fielding displayed a "different level of intensity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. They were "absolutely relentless in the field," diving and scrambling to stop runs, forcing India to take risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. This heightened intensity, described as "playoff intensity," was backed by a combination of skill and energy, with veteran players like David Warner looking like a "spring chicken" with his dives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>.

## Pat Cummins' Masterclass

Pat Cummins' captaincy and bowling in the final were central to Australia's victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>. Despite not having a standout tournament with the ball previously, he delivered his best performance in the final, taking 2 wickets for 34 runs, conceding no boundaries, and securing the crucial wickets of Shreyas Iyer and Virat Kohli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>.

His tactical brilliance included:
*   **Off-spinner's Field**: Cummins set an unconventional field, packing the leg side and removing mid-off, typically seen for an off-spinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.
*   **Effective Cutters**: He maximized the use of slower deliveries (cutters), which had not been fruitful on other pitches but proved devastating on the final surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>.
*   **Reading the Pitch**: Cummins "clearly came in with that in mind" to bowl cutters, waiting for a wicket that would assist them, which he found in the final <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>. His decision to bowl first after winning the toss was a superior reading of conditions compared to India, who likely would have batted first regardless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:39:00">[12:39:00]</a>.
*   **Bowling Changes**: Cummins employed aggressive and often random bowling changes, utilizing seven bowlers in a 10-over period (16th-25th overs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:48:00">[30:48:00]</a>. This strategy disrupted the batters' rhythm, making it "very hard to bat on autopilot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:02:00">[31:02:00]</a>.
*   **Trust in Bowlers**: Cummins trusted his bowlers, notably Mitchell Starc, despite Starc's relatively poor tournament leading up to the final <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:14:00">[51:14:00]</a>. He backed himself and his frontline pacers to perform under pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:24:00">[51:24:00]</a>.
*   **Strategic Deployment of Starc**: Cummins bowled Mitchell Starc early in the innings to capitalize on potential reverse swing and secure extra wickets, a micro-decision that paid off significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:29">[01:02:29]</a>.

## Tactical Battle and Execution

Australia's strategic goal was to apply pressure on key Indian batters, particularly Shreyas Iyer and Virat Kohli, whom they believed would go slow given India's batting depth concerns (referred to as the "Evan Gulbis effect") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:26:00">[27:26:00]</a>.

They aimed to get Iyer out quickly, as he had been dominating spin and scoring rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:23:00">[25:23:00]</a>. By limiting scoring opportunities, they forced Kohli and KL Rahul into a defensive mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:02:00">[26:02:00]</a>. This tactical approach was effective, as both Kohli and Rahul reverted to a slow scoring rate, struggling to find boundaries or even convert singles into twos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:02:00">[30:02:00]</a>.

Australia's bowlers, including Josh Hazlewood with his slower bouncers, executed their plans perfectly against batters like Suryakumar Yadav, making it difficult for him to score freely on a pitch that made timing the ball challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:45:00">[56:45:00]</a>. The team maintained a strong line and length, exploiting the reverse swing conditions to dismiss KL Rahul and Ravindra Jadeja <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:50">[01:00:50]</a>.

Australia's approach was proactive, constantly putting "pressure back on" the opposition rather than passively waiting for mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:56:00">[51:56:00]</a>. This aggressive, attacking mindset, which developed over the tournament, enabled them to capitalize on every opportunity and secure the World Cup title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:14:00">[53:14:00]</a>.

Pakistan's batting performance in the Champions Trophy has been heavily criticized, with commentators describing it as "sleep-inducing" and detrimental to the sport's appeal [02:29:00]. Their style of play has raised significant concerns about their strategic approach and overall effectiveness in One Day International (ODI) cricket [03:05:00].

## Slow Scoring and Lack of Intent

A primary criticism leveled against [[pakistans_batting_collapse_and_analysis|Pakistan's batting]] is their inability to maintain scoring momentum, particularly during crucial phases of the innings [03:14:00].

*   **Mid-Innings Stagnation**: In a recent match, between overs 10 and 25, [[pakistans_batting_collapse_and_analysis|Pakistan's batters]] scored only 44 runs without losing a wicket [02:29:00]. This included a period from overs 10 to 20 where they managed just 27 runs for no loss [02:41:00].
*   **Learning Deficit**: This slow scoring rate mirrors previous matches, where, in the first 10 overs, they were 22 for 2, and after 20 overs, they were 66 for 2, indicating a failure to learn from past mistakes [02:45:00].
*   **Minimal Boundaries**: During the 15-over period from 11 to 25, only one boundary was scored [04:26:00].
*   **Impact on Matches**: This conservative approach led to an insufficient total, as Pakistan fell 39 runs short of a competitive score of 280, being bowled out for 241 [05:31:00].

## Individual Player Issues

Several key batters have come under scrutiny for their individual performances and perceived shortcomings [03:33:00].

*   **Imam-ul-Haq**: Despite playing a significant innings, Imam-ul-Haq was criticized for not putting pressure back on India [08:00:00]. He also made a suicidal run-out, hitting the ball straight to mid-on and taking on the arm of India's fielder [03:49:00].
*   **Mohammad Rizwan**: Rizwan is noted for having "only two gears": third gear and slugging [08:20:00]. His innings often looks worse than it normally would, and he struggles to "catch up" if he falls behind the scoring rate, often resorting to slogging which leads to dismissals [08:16:00]. In one instance, he was 16 for 41 balls [14:41:00], and his strike rate against pace bowling for the entire innings was 42 [14:52:00].
*   **Babar Azam**: Babar Azam's current form is a concern, as he is described as a "five boundary player" [13:42:00]. He either plays too many dot balls or gets out trying to accelerate [13:54:00]. His recent scores include an "attractive score in the 20s or a 90 ball 64 in which he gets to 50 and 81 deliveries" [13:49:00]. Babar's position change to open the batting, while in "woeful touch of form," has been questioned as well [09:16:00].
*   **Saud Shakeel**: While being Pakistan's best batter in a recent game, Saud Shakeel's dismissal was cited as an example of poor shot selection. After being dropped, he attempted an aerial pull shot and got out [14:08:00].
*   **Inability to Convert**: Several batters, including Saud Shakeel and Mohammad Rizwan, were dropped but then got out immediately after [06:46:00]. They tend to go into a shell when needing to rotate strike and get out when they attempt to attack [06:53:00].

## Broader Team Issues

The batting struggles are seen as symptomatic of larger systemic issues within [[pakistans_cricket_strategy_and_performance_issues|Pakistan's cricket strategy]].

*   **Player Archetypes**: The team has "a lot of people who... can basically average 45 to 50 in ODI Cricket... but at a strike rate of like 80 or 85" [07:11:00]. They lack "Heavy Hitters in the middle" [08:36:00] and too many players who "knock it around and don't score very quickly" [10:50:00].
*   **Selection Flaws**: The selection panel is criticized for categorizing players like Khushdil Shah as all-rounders despite a poor bowling record (averages 83 with the ball in ODI cricket, 4 wickets total) [08:53:00]. They have also picked only one specialist spinner and one opener, forcing Babar Azam to open [09:04:00]. The five-man selection panel reportedly picks the playing XI for every team, stripping the captain of power [11:30:00].
*   **Lack of Depth**: Unlike other teams that overcome injuries to key players, [[challenges_faced_by_pakistans_batting_lineup|Pakistan]] struggles significantly because they lack backup options [22:26:00]. There is "no backup that can come in" [22:37:00].
*   **Comparison to India**: The skill gap between Pakistan and India is significant. Many Indian players not in the squad, such as Yash Dayal, Suryakumar Yadav, or even those like Jurel, would be top players in Pakistan's squad [24:17:00]. India's depth allows them to bench players like Sanju Samson, whereas Pakistan lacks similar quality [27:28:00].

> "Pakistan have the same old issues and I mean they came back to haunt them and this was honestly a terrible advert for ODI Cricket their entire their theme of this Champions Trophy has been putting you know viewers to sleep" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

The struggles in [[pakistans_batting_collapse_and_analysis|Pakistan's batting]] performance in the Champions Trophy highlight deep-seated issues related to slow scoring, predictable play, individual player shortcomings, and flawed selection strategies [05:58:00]. These issues have contributed to their early exit from the tournament, making their performances a "terrible advert for ODI Cricket" [06:05:00].

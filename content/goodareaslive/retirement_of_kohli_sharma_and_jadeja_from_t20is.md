## Player Retirements

### [[Virat Kohlis retirement and legacy | Virat Kohli]]
[[Virat Kohlis retirement and legacy | Kohli]] concluded his T20I career after scoring 76 runs off 59 deliveries in the T20 World Cup final <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:20">[02:00:20]</a>. This final innings significantly boosted his tournament tally, as he had only scored 75 runs in the entire campaign leading up to the final match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:14">[02:00:14]</a>. His performance in the final was highlighted by three phases: an initial aggressive start with 15 runs in the first over, a rebuilding phase after early wickets, and then an acceleration in his last 26 runs, which came off just 10 deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:41">[02:20:41]</a>. [[Virat Kohlis retirement and legacy | Kohli]]'s T20I career saw him score over 4,000 runs for India at a strike rate of 137 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:17">[02:03:17]</a>.

### [[Rohit Sharmas Test Retirement and its Impact on Indian Cricket | Rohit Sharma]]
[[Rohit Sharmas Test Retirement and its Impact on Indian Cricket | Rohit Sharma]] had a "splendid tournament" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:24">[02:00:24]</a> and successfully led India to their second T20 World Cup title, becoming the first captain to win the competition unbeaten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:27">[01:26:27]</a>. Like [[Virat Kohlis retirement and legacy | Kohli]], [[Rohit Sharmas Test Retirement and its Impact on Indian Cricket | Sharma]] also scored over 4,000 runs in the T20I format for India, maintaining a strike rate of 140 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:17">[02:03:17]</a>. His captaincy was praised for backing his bowlers, unlike South Africa's captain Aiden Markram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:09">[00:54:09]</a>.

### Ravindra Jadeja
Ravindra Jadeja, described as the "weakest link" in the [[Indias cricket team transition postKohli | Indian team]] by some during the T20 World Cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:36">[02:00:36]</a>, also announced his retirement from T20Is. His role was crucial at number eight in the batting lineup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:56">[02:00:56]</a>.

## Legacy and Impact
The retirements of these three players mark the end of an era, allowing a [[Indias cricket team transition postKohli | new generation]] to emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:26">[02:01:26]</a>.

This collective retirement is seen as a "perfect time" to move on, as there was speculation about whether they would be picked for the next T20 World Cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:17">[02:04:17]</a>. Despite their T20I retirements, all three players are considered "critical to [[Indias cricket team transition postKohli | India's test team]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:32">[02:04:32]</a>, and there is hope they will continue to play Test Cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:28">[02:04:28]</a>. There is also a suggestion for [[Virat Kohlis retirement and legacy | Kohli]] to focus on IPL and Test Cricket to allow himself a break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:11">[02:02:11]</a>.

## Rahul Dravid's Departure as Coach
Rahul Dravid also concluded his tenure as [[Indias cricket team transition postKohli | India's head coach]] with the T20 World Cup victory, marking a "perfect time to go out" for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:41">[02:04:41]</a>. Dravid, known for his calm and technical approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:58">[02:04:58]</a>, emphasized winning the cup for the team itself, rather than for individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:04">[02:05:04]</a>.

> [!info] Dravid's belief: "I don't like the narrative where you need to win this cup for somebody. It's out there to win, there's a cup someone needs to win it, and we should be the team that goes on and takes it for us. You know, win it for yourself and if there's something out there, it's there for the taking." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:04">[02:05:04]</a>

His success as coach is seen as cementing his legacy as an [[Indias cricket team transition postKohli | Indian legend]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:17">[02:07:17]</a>, especially for a new generation who might not have witnessed his playing career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:28">[02:07:28]</a>.

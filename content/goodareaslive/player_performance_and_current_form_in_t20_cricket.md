This article discusses the performance and current form of various players in Twenty20 (T20) cricket, focusing on their suitability for a hypothetical "Best Current T20 World 12" based solely on recent performance, not past records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

## Key Players and Their Impact

### Jasprit Bumrah
Considered the best all-format cricketer in contemporary cricket, [[evaluating_current_cricket_players_across_formats | Jasprit Bumrah]] is currently peaking in T20s, an unexpected development post-injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. His performance in the IPL and the T20 World Cup has made him unplayable, possessing a never-ending bag of tricks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. He can bowl in all phases, bowl dry, and act as an out-and-out wicket-taker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. His unique angle and release point contribute to his success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.

### Travis Head
[[assessing_the_performance_and_style_of_specific_cricket_players | Travis Head]] has evolved into a "new kind of Beast" as an opener, capable of going "berserk" from ball one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>. His aggressive approach was evident in the IPL for Sunrisers Hyderabad and for [[australian_cricket_team_performance_trends | Australia]], notably in the T20 World Cup, including a game against England where [[australian_cricket_team_performance_trends | Australia]] effectively won in the power play due to his and David Warner's efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. He epitomizes modern T20 batting with answers to all deliveries and a "predator mode" mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>. His "all intent mindset" has brought him significant success across formats over the last two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>. He is also noted as a "big game player," having been Man of the Match in the 50-over World Cup final and the World Test Championship final <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>.

### Heinrich Klaasen
[[assessing_the_performance_and_style_of_specific_cricket_players | Heinrich Klaasen]] is considered by some to be the best current batter in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>. His impact on South Africa is immense, as he can pull the team through tough situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>. He is "tailor-made" for the middle overs, a "monster versus spin," and has developed a unique "back foot straight pull" shot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>. Klaasen's ability to score quickly and make a lot of runs across phases sets him apart, as his slowest phase is still faster than the average batter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25:00">[11:25:00]</a>.

### Suryakumar Yadav (Sky)
[[assessing_the_performance_and_style_of_specific_cricket_players | Suryakumar Yadav]], or Sky, has significantly disrupted and changed T20 cricket with his "360-degree cricket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:37:00">[17:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:39:00">[17:39:00]</a>. His exotic style is distinct from others, and length does not matter to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:53:00">[17:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:00">[18:00:00]</a>. Sky proved his pedigree on tough batting conditions by scoring a match-winning half-century against the USA in New York, demonstrating his ability to hit the ball in difficult environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:07:00">[18:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:15:00">[18:15:00]</a>. He is considered one of the most devastating ball strikers in the modern game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:20:00">[18:20:00]</a>.

### Matheesha Pathirana
[[assessing_the_performance_and_style_of_specific_cricket_players | Matheesha Pathirana]] is a "gun" bowler and considered the best strike bowler currently in white-ball cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:11:00">[22:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:20:00">[22:20:00]</a>. He possesses a unique and outlier release point and angle, making him highly effective in getting bowled dismissals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:46:00">[22:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:02:00">[23:02:00]</a>. Pathirana's current form is "really, really good," and he was considered the answer for Chennai in the IPL before his departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:20:00">[23:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:25:00">[23:25:00]</a>.

### Andre Russell
[[assessing_the_performance_and_style_of_specific_cricket_players | Andre Russell]] is still going strong as an all-rounder, offering immense experience with the ball, especially through the middle overs where he can deliver short balls to good effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:09:00">[26:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:15:00">[26:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:24:00">[26:24:00]</a>. He is a gun fielder and "ludicrous" with the bat, capable of adapting his game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:05:00">[27:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:07:00">[27:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:10:00">[27:10:00]</a>.

Despite being 36, he is still good enough for a World XI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:57:00">[27:57:00]</a>.

### Jos Buttler
[[assessing_the_performance_and_style_of_specific_cricket_players | Jos Buttler]] is an impactful player, versatile enough to play through different gears based on game situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:03:00">[30:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:06:00">[30:06:00]</a>. He is a strong candidate for captaincy and an ideal opening partner for Travis Head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:10:00">[30:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:22:00">[30:22:00]</a>. Buttler's killer reverse sweep, which he executes as second nature, and his ability to score quick runs in tough conditions, make him a valuable asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:35:00">[30:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:41:00">[30:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:50:00">[30:50:00]</a>. His versatility allows him to get runs in tough conditions or go from ball one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:19:00">[31:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:29:00">[31:29:00]</a>.

### Nicholas Pooran
[[assessing_the_performance_and_style_of_specific_cricket_players | Nicholas Pooran]] is considered, behind Heinrich Klaasen, the best striker of the ball currently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:30:00">[32:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:33:00">[32:33:00]</a>. He provides a left-handed option in the middle order and can keep wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:35:00">[32:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:12:00">[33:12:00]</a>. Pooran is versatile, capable of batting at the top of the order or fulfilling a finisher's role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:22:00">[33:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:26:00">[33:26:00]</a>. When he starts hitting, he doesn't stop, making him tough to contain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:44:00">[34:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:54:00">[34:54:00]</a>.

### Rashid Khan
[[assessing_the_performance_and_style_of_specific_cricket_players | Rashid Khan]] has consistently performed well for a long time, showing few dips in form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:08:00">[35:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:46:00">[35:46:00]</a>. He is an explosive, unorthodox batter who can easily clear boundaries, adding another dimension to his already impressive package as a player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:19:00">[35:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:24:00">[35:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:28:00">[35:28:00]</a>. Rashid is also an excellent fielder, a fact often overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:05:00">[36:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:08:00">[36:08:00]</a>. He could be considered the best T20 wrist spinner ever, and his recent 4 for 7 against New Zealand reaffirmed his destructive capabilities on Caribbean surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:13:00">[36:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:20:00">[36:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:41:00">[36:41:00]</a>.

### Trent Boult

Boult's ability to hoop the ball and his experience make him a solid choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:09:00">[39:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:23:00">[39:23:00]</a>. He is an "absolute gun" at getting a wicket in the first over, an incredible skill in T20 cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:11:00">[41:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:15:00">[41:15:00]</a>.

### David Miller
[[assessing_the_performance_and_style_of_specific_cricket_players | David Miller]] is in very good current form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:53:00">[42:53:00]</a>. He is a player who can stay in when the team is in trouble, demonstrated by one of the best innings of the T20 World Cup on a tough New York pitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:59:00">[42:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:04:00">[43:04:00]</a>.

## Players Not Currently in Optimal Form or Available

*   **Sunil Narine:** While he had a "ludicrously" good IPL with his batting, he doesn't qualify for a World XI due to his unavailability for the West Indies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:50:00">[20:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:01:00">[21:01:00]</a>.
*   **Glenn Maxwell:** Despite his past capabilities, [[performance_of_specific_players_in_t20_world_cup_2024 | Glenn Maxwell]] is in "appalling form," with a "horrendous IPL" where he averaged only seven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:40:00">[21:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:45:00">[21:45:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:49:00">[21:49:00]</a>.
*   **Virat Kohli:** While very good in the IPL, [[player_performance_analysis_in_test_cricket | Virat Kohli]] has been "absolutely atrocious" in the T20 World Cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:24:00">[44:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:27:00">[44:27:00]</a>. Despite being a fantastic fielder who never switches off, his current batting form does not place him ahead of the chosen top three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:30:00">[44:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:37:00">[50:37:00]</a>.
*   **Kuldeep Yadav:** A quality spinner and massive wicket-taking option, [[cricket_and_player_performances | Kuldeep Yadav]] is a good left-arm wrist spinner with immense control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:00">[15:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26:00">[16:26:00]</a>. However, he was not deemed one of the top four spinners for a current World XI by some, and his batting is not considered strong enough for a high batting order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22:00">[15:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:21:00">[16:21:00]</a>.
*   **Glenn Phillips:** Was considered for a middle-order slot but his current form is not strong enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:59:00">[46:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:14:00">[49:14:00]</a>.
*   **Sikandar Raza:** An in-form player in the last couple of years, offering an off-spinning option and handy batting, but his team (Zimbabwe) is not playing in the current T20 World Cup, placing him at a disadvantage for current form selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:11:00">[47:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:19:00">[47:19:00]</a>.
*   **Akeal Hosein:** Was considered for a deeper batting lineup option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:05:00">[48:05:00]</a>.
*   **Mustafizur Rahman (Fizz):** Had a good couple of months and IPL, and is very difficult to get away on slow wickets, with a unique wrist action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:36:00">[49:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:48:00">[49:48:00]</a>.

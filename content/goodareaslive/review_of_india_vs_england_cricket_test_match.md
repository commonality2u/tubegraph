India has taken a 2-1 series lead against England, securing a dominant 434-run victory in Rajkot. This win marks the eighth largest pounding by runs in the history of Test cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

## Match Overview
The match was not always straightforward for India. They initially struggled, being 33 for 3 in their first innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. At the end of Day 2, England appeared to be in a strong position, with Ben Duckett batting aggressively and India losing Ravi Ashwin temporarily mid-test due to a family emergency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. Despite being 250 runs behind, there was considerable confidence around England's ability to compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. However, India managed to turn the tide and inflict a significant defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. A crucial moment in the match was Joe Root dropping Rohit Sharma when India was around 40-45 for 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

## Batting Performances
India's victory was largely attributed to their strong batting. They probably made around 850 runs in the match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>.

### Yashasvi Jaiswal
Yashasvi Jaiswal continued his impressive form, hitting another double century, remaining unbeaten on 214 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:59:00">[26:59:00]</a>. In just seven Test matches, he now has three centuries, all of them "daddy hundreds" (170+ on debut and two double centuries in this series) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:06:00">[27:06:00]</a>. He equaled Wasim Akram's record of 12 sixes in a Test innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:14:00">[27:14:00]</a> and averages nearly 72 after these seven matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:20:00">[27:20:00]</a>. Jaiswal's innings was particularly fascinating as he started slowly before exploding, specifically targeting James Anderson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:21:00">[28:21:00]</a>. His method against off-spin, attacking both line and length, has been highlighted as particularly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:52:00">[28:52:50]</a>.

### Other Indian Centurions
Ravindra Jadeja, despite not being fully fit after returning from injury, scored 112 runs and took seven wickets (including a fifer in the fourth innings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:53:00">[16:53:00]</a>. He now holds the most Player of the Match awards for an Indian player in India, tied with Anil Kumble, having played 20 fewer Tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:08:00">[17:08:00]</a>. At his home ground, Rajkot, Jadeja averages 140 with the bat and 19 with the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:22:00">[17:22:00]</a>. Rohit Sharma also scored a century, and Shubman Gill fell nine runs short of a century in the second innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:30:00">[30:30:00]</a>.

### Sarfaraz Khan
Sarfaraz Khan made his Test debut, scoring 62 in the first innings and an unbeaten 68 in the second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:34:00">[35:34:00]</a>. His debut, marked by emotional moments with his father receiving his Test cap, was highly anticipated after years of domestic success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:34:00">[33:34:34]</a>.

### England Batting
Ben Duckett's 153 in the first innings was described as swashbuckling and potentially his best Test innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:40:00">[36:40:00]</a>. He has a weakness against short, outside off-stump deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:54:00">[37:54:00]</a>.

## [[Test Match Analysis IND vs ENG 4th Test Day 3 | Bazball]] Discussion
The match sparked considerable debate about England's "Bazball" approach. This was seen as the first time it "didn't work," even though England had lost before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. At the end of Day 2, even Ravi Ashwin felt the game was "quite level," which suggests how Bazball can influence perceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

England's strategy to aggressively target Indian bowlers like Kuldeep Yadav and Mohammed Siraj was noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. However, in Ashwin's absence, Siraj took four wickets, turning the tide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.

It was argued that Bazball's inherent risk makes it susceptible to big losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>. While England players often speak of saving Test Cricket and show no accountability, their public statements are often for the "change room" rather than the media or fans, aiming to maintain belief within the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>.

Before "Bazball," England's batting was considered "comically low," with extras being their fourth-leading scorer in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:26:00">[26:26:00]</a>. Under "Bazball," almost all their batters' averages have improved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:40:00">[26:40:00]</a>. The approach is a deliberate attempt to play to strengths and mitigate technical flaws, as seen with Joe Root's reverse scoop against Jasprit Bumrah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:52:00">[25:52:00]</a>.

However, the strategy of batting quickly means their bowlers receive less rest, making them vulnerable if the opposition bats long. India successfully implemented this by making England field for 200-250 overs, leading to visible fatigue among players like Joe Root and Ben Stokes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>. The pitch conditions, more suited to Indian spinners, also played a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>.

It is acknowledged that Bazball has influenced other teams to play more aggressively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:20:00">[15:20:00]</a>. However, India is now adjusting to these tactics in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:00]</a>. While England has given themselves a chance to win all three Tests under Bazball, they might not have had that chance playing traditionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:27:00">[43:27:00]</a>.

## DRS and Umpire's Call
Following the match, Ben Stokes collaborated with Sachin Tendulkar to advocate against the "umpire's call" rule in DRS, taking a dig at technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:02">[01:19:02]</a>. Critics suggest this reaction comes from a place of frustration after consecutive losses, rather than a deep understanding of the scientific rationale behind the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:27">[01:19:27]</a>. Hawkeye states that "umpire's call" is necessary because there's less certainty on marginal decisions (e.g., ball just clipping the outside of the stump) compared to clear-cut impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. It is argued that altering "umpire's call" would lead to complaints about other aspects of the predictive system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. Ultimately, England did not lose the game because of "umpire's call" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>, and crowd pressure is noted to play a part in umpiring decisions, leading to slightly worse calls for touring teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.

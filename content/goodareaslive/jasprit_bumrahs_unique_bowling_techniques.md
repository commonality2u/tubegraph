[[Jasprit Bumrahs impact in all cricket formats | Jasprit Bumrah]] has achieved a "freakish" peak in his career since returning from injury, marked by 74 wickets in 31 international matches across formats at an average under 16 and an economy rate of under four runs per over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. His exceptional performance is largely attributed to his distinct and unique bowling techniques, which allow him to operate at an "other-worldly level" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Unorthodox Action and Release Point
[[Jasprit Bumrahs unique bowling techniques | Bumrah]] possesses a "freakish" bowling action, which is a core component of his success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. This action allows him to deliver the ball approximately half a meter closer to the batters than most other bowlers, effectively "shortening the pitch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. This unique release point causes the ball to feel like it's coming earlier than expected, rushing batsmen even when [[Jasprit Bumrahs unique bowling techniques | Bumrah]] bowls at 88 mph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. This advantage is shared by other bowlers like Naveen-ul-Haq, who also rush batsmen at lower speeds due to similar actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

## Short and Unusual Run-up
[[Jasprit Bumrahs unique bowling techniques | Bumrah]] has a short and interesting run-up, which further complicates things for batters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. Unlike longer run-ups that provide more information, [[Jasprit Bumrahs unique bowling techniques | Bumrah's]] run-up, likened to a "handicapped horse at times," gives batters less time to gather information about the delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. Despite this short run-up, he maintains exceptional accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. This combination of a short run-up and a close release point creates a massive advantage, as batters are trained to expect a standard release point and are thrown off by his subtle changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

## Diverse Variations and Pinpoint Accuracy
[[Jasprit Bumrahs unique bowling techniques | Bumrah]] possesses a wide array of variations and excels in nailing their respective lengths consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. While bowlers like [[Glenn McGrath]] and Vernon Philander were known for their accuracy at a designated length, [[Jasprit Bumrahs unique bowling techniques | Bumrah]] can bowl with multiple lengths for his different variations, hitting each precisely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. He can deliver back-of-a-length deliveries to curb scoring, length balls as wicket-taking options, and devastating yorkers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. He has about five distinct lengths he can bowl, along with accurate cutters, which is a rare skill for a fast bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

## Impact of His Techniques on Batters
Even when [[Jasprit Bumrahs unique bowling techniques | Bumrah]] makes mistakes, his unique action and inherent pressure mean his "bad" balls are difficult to score off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>. In the 2024 IPL, his slot balls had an economy of 7.5 and an average of 30, while his full tosses went for an economy of 5.5 and an average of 15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>. This is because his action rushes batters, leaving them behind the ball even on errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>. Batters are often told not to play stupid shots against him, leading to cautious play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. His unique methods make it nearly impossible for batters to take him on with most shots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. Attempting a pull shot against his back-of-a-length delivery in the 2024 IPL, for example, resulted in an average of 10 for batters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>.

## Masterful Wrist Usage and Evolutionary Bowling
[[Jasprit Bumrahs unique bowling techniques | Bumrah's]] use of his wrist is described as "art" and a high skill level in modern pace bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:03">[00:33:03]</a>. Alongside Mustafizur Rahman ("the Fizz"), [[Jasprit Bumrahs unique bowling techniques | Bumrah]] represents the "next evolution of fast bowling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:28">[00:34:28]</a>. This evolution is partly attributed to the influence of rubber ball or tape ball bowling in Asia and the natural progression of slower balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a>. While the Fizz is seen as an 85 mph spin bowler, [[Jasprit Bumrahs unique bowling techniques | Bumrah]] is viewed as a fast bowler incorporating spin bowling skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:06">[00:35:06]</a>.

He possesses traditional fast bowling skills like swing, seam, wobble, and reverse swing, but also incorporates techniques seen in spin bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a>. An example is how he set up England's Ollie Robinson with bouncers before bowling an "off-spinner" from around the wicket, demonstrating a "completely different level of bowling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>. This blend of skills showcases the [[Evolution of bowling techniques and challenges in modern cricket | T20 format bringing back old Red Ball Cricket skills]] that had disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:43">[00:37:43]</a>.

## Overall Impact and Unpredictability
[[Jasprit Bumrahs unique bowling techniques | Bumrah's]] extensive arsenal of tricks makes him unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. He can bowl at express pace, with cutters, or "within himself" at 130-140 km/h, and remains effective at all speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>. Even when he bowls within himself at a slower pace, batters struggle to score runs off him, with an economy rate of just four runs per over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:29">[00:30:29]</a>. This ability to "coast" while still being highly effective sets him apart from bowlers like Dale Steyn or Waqar Younis, who had to bowl at their limit constantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a>.

His presence significantly impacts the game beyond his own overs, as batters know he is difficult to score against and tend to attack other bowlers more in the overs around his <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>. This "gravitational force" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a> means he effectively takes wickets at both ends of the innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>. This strategic influence makes him more than just the overs he bowls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:53">[00:26:53]</a>.

The second day of the Test match presented unexpected [[cricket_match_analysis_between_india_and_australia | cricket match analysis between India and Australia]] results, with a significant shift in pitch conditions impacting batting performances for both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. What was described as one of the "greenest wickets" overnight transformed into one of the "flattest wickets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This change in pitch notably influenced the scoring rates and techniques employed by batters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, leading to a stark contrast in batting averages between Day 1 and Day 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

## Pitch Conditions and Their Impact
The pitch at Perth Stadium experienced a dramatic change, drying out overnight, which was evident in the color change of the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. This transformation meant that Day 2's batting conditions were "vastly less seam" movement compared to Day 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:03">[00:38:03]</a>. On Day 1, the average seam movement was around 1 degree, making batting challenging and leading to an average score of 12.76 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. In contrast, on Day 2, the average score rose significantly to 69.3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. This indicates that the pitch became considerably easier for batting, as less seam movement generally correlates with higher batting averages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

## Australian Batting Performance
The [[australian_cricket_team_performance_trends | Australian cricket team performance trends]] on Day 2 showcased an unexpected display from their tail-enders. Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood, despite being lower-order batters, demonstrated exceptional defensive techniques and control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Starc's control percentage was only 20% "out of control" during his innings, indicating a high level of composure even while batting with the tail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Despite the improved batting conditions, Starc and Hazlewood opted to not score runs for an "awfully long time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, resulting in about an hour where the match situation remained stagnant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

Travis Head noted the team's patience in the middle session, as they continued to "wait and wait" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. However, this patient approach was criticized for its lack of proactivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>, particularly evident when Marnus Labuschagne resorted to bowling two spells of bouncers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

A notable incident was Alex Carey's dismissal on the first ball he faced from Jasprit Bumrah, which seemed to set a negative tone for Australia's chase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. This single dismissal occurred despite the pitch generally favoring batters on Day 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>.

## Indian Batting Performance
India's batting on Day 2, particularly from Yashasvi Jaiswal and KL Rahul, was highly commended due to the more "favorable conditions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### Yashasvi Jaiswal
Jaiswal's batting was praised for its control and technical soundness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. He avoided chasing the ball and waited for it to be in his "right area" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. While he wasn't attacking constantly, he capitalized on poorly executed deliveries from Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. His innings today was his slowest score over 50 runs outside of India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>, demonstrating his ability to adapt and play a patient game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. Despite leaving fewer balls than his usual 28% (today it was 21%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>, his strong defensive shots and comfortable play outside the off-stump highlighted his improved technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. His performance showcased flexibility, adding a slower, more defensive approach to his repertoire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

### KL Rahul
KL Rahul's performance, particularly his ability to make hundreds overseas, was highlighted as a remarkable aspect of his [[player_performance_analysis_in_test_cricket | Player performance analysis in Test cricket]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. Despite periods of low scores, he consistently delivers big hundreds when it matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. His record is often characterized by either substantial scores or a string of failures, indicating a high ceiling and a low floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. His current innings was recognized as one of the best by any batter in this [[india_vs_australia_test_cricket_analysis | India vs Australia Test Cricket Analysis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>. He showed an organized approach, effectively leaving the ball and getting his bat behind his pad, demonstrating skill in modern cricket where bowlers often angle balls back in or use wobble-seam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>.

### India's Tail-end Batting and Overall Approach
Statistical analysis showed that India has performed well with the bat from their last three wickets, comparable to Australia and Sri Lanka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>. Furthermore, India has been the "best team at bowling to the tail and finishing off an innings" in the last three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. This contradicts a common fan perception that India struggles against the tail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

India's strategy involved playing a patient game, not rushing to score quickly, especially after the initial period of seam movement subsided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:55">[00:33:55]</a>. This approach allowed them to slowly build their lead as the ball got softer and bowlers tired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a>.

## Run Rate Analysis
The match's run rate was notably slow, at one point marking the "fourth slowest test match in Australia for the last 20 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>. The lowest run rate recorded during the match was around 2.54 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. This slow scoring, even on an improved batting wicket, suggests that it was a pitch "hard to be dismissed on rather than a wicket that is easy to score on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>. Factors contributing to the slow run rate included significant seam movement on Day 1, Australia's middle-order collapse, Starc's slow scoring, and both teams adopting a patient approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:04">[00:43:04]</a>. The large playing surface at Perth Stadium, which makes easy fours harder to come by, also played a part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>.

## Conclusion
The [[analysis_of_india_vs_australia_1st_test_day_3_performance | Analysis of India vs Australia 1st Test Day 3 performance]] highlights a dramatic shift in pitch conditions which significantly benefited the batting sides on Day 2. While Australia's tail-enders showed surprising resilience, their overall strategy was perceived as too passive. India, benefiting from the flatter pitch, saw strong performances from Jaiswal and Rahul, who adapted their game to the conditions, patiently building a lead. Despite the slow overall run rate, India's measured approach, combined with favorable conditions, placed them in a dominant position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:29">[00:34:29]</a>.

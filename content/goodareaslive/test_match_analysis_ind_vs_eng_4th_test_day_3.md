The third day of the 4th Test between India and England saw significant swings in momentum, with India ultimately gaining a dominant position by stumps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:07">[02:44:07]</a>.

## Match Summary

At stumps on Day 3, England was in a position where they "cannot win" the match, following a wild ride of fortunes throughout the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:07">[02:42:07]</a>. India had previously been in a similar position, with "no chance of winning" at drinks on Day 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:52">[02:39:52]</a>, and England had "no chance of winning" at lunch on Day 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:06">[02:36:06]</a>.

England started the day looking tired and out of ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>. Although Zak Crawley fought back strongly, bringing England "in it again" by approaching tea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:41">[01:40:41]</a>, the team's performance after tea was described as "really bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:47">[02:04:47]</a>. The collapse saw England lose six or seven wickets for 35 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:25">[05:01:25]</a>.

## Pitch Report

The pitch continued to be "challenging and weird" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:55">[06:03:55]</a>. While the cracks that were visible earlier in the match seemingly "had all the cracks glued back together" at the start of Day 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:22">[01:20:22]</a>, this did not deter Ashwin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:50">[01:24:50]</a>.

The middle part of the day, when the sun came out, significantly changed the wicket's behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:24">[03:51:24]</a>. Despite visible cracks, few balls played up in the same way as on Day 1 or Day 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:10">[03:34:10]</a>. The pitch exhibited inconsistent bounce, with balls occasionally skidding through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:47">[08:48:47]</a>. Dhruv Jurel was hit on the arm guard by a spinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:04">[06:06:04]</a>, while another ball that dismissed Stokes kept low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:23">[01:53:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:27">[03:40:27]</a>.

India scored at 2.9 runs an over in the first session against England's bowling, which increased to five runs an over later, both against the new ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:56">[04:34:56]</a>. This indicated the wicket reacted differently than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:48">[04:44:48]</a>.

## Player Performances

### Ravichandran Ashwin
Ashwin had an "absolutely outstanding" performance, despite prior questions about his age catching up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:48">[07:10:48]</a>. He took wickets from "normal good parts of the pitch" by bowling straight, becoming a "second innings new ball destroyer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:32">[01:32:32]</a>.

*   **Ben Duckett's Dismissal**: Ashwin consistently troubles Duckett due to the latter's attempt to protect his outside edge by getting slightly inside the ball during forward defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:14">[07:14:14]</a>. Duckett's reverse sweep is arguably better than his defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:54">[07:27:54]</a>. Ashwin has a significantly better average (16 vs. 65.66) and strike rate against Duckett with the new ball in India over the last five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:27">[11:53:27]</a>.
*   **Ollie Pope's Dismissal**: Pope was dismissed by a straight ball from Ashwin early in his innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:04">[07:34:04]</a>. If it had spun even an inch, it likely would have missed leg stump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:06">[07:41:06]</a>. This was described as "really good new ball bowling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:04">[07:47:04]</a>. Pope's dismissal showed a regression in his performance, making more false shots early in his innings in subsequent matches after his Hyderabad century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:20">[02:53:20]</a>.
*   **New Ball Specialist**: Ashwin averages 16 against left-handers with the new ball in India over the last five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:06">[07:56:06]</a>. He excels with the new ball, especially in the third innings of a match, where he can skid the ball through and exploit inconsistent bounce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:44">[08:08:44]</a>. He is considered potentially the first truly great new ball spinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:32">[08:58:32]</a>.
*   **Captaincy Decisions**: Despite Ashwin's effectiveness, Rohit Sharma has "overbowled his new ball bowlers" against Crawley, and hasn't utilized Ashwin with the new ball as much as he could have in the series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>. Ashwin usually bowls around 30% of the time with the new ball in India, but this series it dropped to 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:42">[09:22:42]</a>.

*   **Ollie Pope's Dismissal**: Pope was dismissed by a straight ball from Ashwin early in his innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:04">[07:34:04]</a>. If it had spun even an inch, it likely would have missed leg stump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:06">[07:41:06]</a>.

Ashwin usually bowls around 30% of the time with the new ball in India, but this series it dropped to 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:42">[09:22:42]</a>.

### Kuldeep Yadav
Kuldeep Yadav was crucial in helping India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>. He consistently bowls around 15-16 overs, used strategically against top-order batters who struggle against him, or in flat moments to change momentum, and against the tail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:52">[14:50:52]</a>. However, with two other world-class spinners in the side, he may not always get as many overs as he otherwise might <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52:43">[15:52:43]</a>. His economy rate has significantly improved in recent games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:00">[16:03:00]</a>. Kuldeep's test bowling average remains remarkably flat across his 11 test matches, indicating his consistency as a wicket-taker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:48:00">[16:48:00]</a>.

*   **Zak Crawley's Dismissal**: Kuldeep bowled a "really clever" delivery to dismiss Crawley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:18">[02:50:18]</a>. Kuldeep and Rohit discussed tactics just before the wicket, deciding to open up the cover region to tempt Crawley to play against the spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. Crawley attempted to play off the back foot through cover when he should have been playing off the front foot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

### Zak Crawley
Crawley fought back hard, getting England "in it again" after initially looking tired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:41">[01:40:41]</a>. He scored well on a pitch that wasn't rolling along the ground as seen before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:27">[01:46:27]</a>.

*   **Batting Style**: Crawley played 91% of his shots on the front foot and 99.9% on the back foot, which ultimately led to his dismissal off the back foot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40">[01:21:40]</a>. He expected the pitch to bounce more, which was a "poor shot" decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:06">[01:42:06]</a>.
*   **Performance Against Spin/Pace**: In his first three tests, Crawley averaged 97 against pace and 26 against spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:04">[01:59:04]</a>. In this match, he averaged 58 against spin, showing "real growth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:14">[02:14:14]</a>. His main skill is his ability to stay in the crease, reach balls, and put pressure on bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:06">[02:42:06]</a>. He made balls from Ashwin that weren't half-volleys look like half-volleys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:18">[02:50:18]</a>.
*   **Career Average**: Despite this good form, his career average is only 32.46 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:55">[02:33:55]</a>. This is partly due to a lack of not-outs and declaration not-outs, but primarily because he gets many starts that he doesn't convert into big scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:07">[02:44:07]</a>.

### Dhruv Jurel
Jurel was told to "play straight as a kid" and took it seriously, which was beneficial on a wicket where the ball sometimes kept low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>. He impressed by playing proper cricket shots, even when batting with the tail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:20">[02:53:20]</a>. His strike rate increased from 50 on Day 2 and early Day 3 to 75 without going "nuts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:27">[03:00:27]</a>.

*   **Field Placement**: England had three fielders covering the straight boundary (straight on, wide long off, very straight extra cover) due to Jurel's straight playing style against spinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:42">[02:22:42]</a>.
*   **Keeping**: Jurel missed a stumping chance which he "should have taken" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:20">[02:53:20]</a>, but his catch off Jimmy Anderson was exceptional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:40">[02:21:40]</a>.

## Strategic Insights

*   **England's Bowling**: England's two opening bowlers delivered "a metric ton of full tosses and half volleys" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:20">[02:18:20]</a>. England's spinners appeared tired and were waiting for the wicket to assist them, and later "couldn't land the ball anyway" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. England probably overbowled their seamers, and should have started with one seamer (Jimmy Anderson) and one spinner (Hartley) for control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:31">[03:33:31]</a>.
*   **India's Bowling**: India bowled better in the middle sessions without directly hitting the cracks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:38">[05:22:38]</a>. The talent level between the India Spinners and England's spinners was evident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:11">[05:36:11]</a>. The combination of Ashwin and Kuldeep is very effective due to their contrasting styles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:06">[05:42:06]</a>.
*   **Bazball**: Bazball is not solely about batting; it relies heavily on the short ball to manufacture wickets, which is less effective on these pitches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:02">[05:40:02]</a>. While some argue it's not suitable for spinning tracks, England won the first Test playing "completely Bazball" on a spinning track, and were in front in the second and this fourth Test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:47">[05:20:47]</a>. This method has prevented them from being the "worst batting team in the world" as they were before Bazball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:47">[05:20:47]</a>.

## DRS Controversies

Discussions arose regarding DRS decisions, particularly concerning Root's dismissal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. The ball was very full and hit the pad, making the predictive element of Hawkeye less reliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:47">[04:09:47]</a>. While the ball's line was likely just inside leg stump, its projected impact on the stumps was debated due to the "whiffy" predictive nature of the technology for fuller balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. The speaker expressed a feeling that Hawkeye's projections have been "more random" in the last year or so, including during this series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:08">[04:07:08]</a>. Both Indian and English fans complained about decisions at different points, indicating a "fairness in its unfairness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. England's general discomfort with the DRS system, rather than individual decisions, was also noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.

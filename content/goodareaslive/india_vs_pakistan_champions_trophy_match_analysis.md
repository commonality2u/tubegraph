In a significant encounter, India defeated Pakistan by six wickets with 45 balls to spare in Dubai, effectively eliminating the home team from the Champions Trophy just five days into the tournament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. This early exit was seen as a "dampener" for the event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.

## Pakistan's Performance: A Cause for Concern

Pakistan's play in this [[comparative_analysis_of_india_and_pakistan_cricket_teams | match]] was characterized by slow batting, strategic missteps, and fielding errors, leading to a frustrating experience for viewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.

### Batting Struggles
Pakistan's batting was particularly problematic. Between overs 10 and 25, they scored only 44 runs without losing a wicket, and from overs 10 to 20, it was 27 runs for no loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. This slow scoring rate was described as a "muscle relaxing sleeping pill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. They conceded less than three runs per over for 15 overs after a decent powerplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. The team posted 241 runs, which was considered 39 runs short of a competitive total on the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>.

Individual performances were also criticized:
*   **Babar Azam** was described as a "five boundary player" with an "attractive score in the 20s" or a "90 ball 64" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:00">[13:42:00]</a>. His form has been poor, especially being asked to open the batting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>.
*   **Mohammad Rizwan** struggled with strike rotation and accelerating, often getting out when trying to attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>. His strike rate against pace bowling was 42 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:52:00">[14:52:00]</a>. He was 16 for 41 at one point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:00">[14:41:00]</a>.
*   **Imam-ul-Haq** ran himself out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:00">[14:03:00]</a>.
*   **Saud Shakeel** was Pakistan's best batter but got out attempting an aerial pull shot after being dropped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:08:00">[14:08:00]</a>.

The commentators noted a recurring issue: Pakistan's batters can average 45-50 in ODIs but with a strike rate of only 80-86 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>. This creates a problem where they don't put pressure on the opposition and struggle to catch up if they fall behind the required rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:00">[15:10:00]</a>.

### Bowling and Fielding Deficiencies
Pakistan's fielding was poor, dropping two catches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.
*   **Shaheen Afridi** was expensive, conceding 74 runs for two wickets in eight overs, despite a "worldly of a Yorker" to Rohit Sharma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:36:00">[16:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21:00">[17:21:00]</a>. Indian batters treated him "like a spinner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:31:00">[17:31:00]</a>. He also made a bizarre review call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:53:00">[17:53:00]</a>.
*   **Haris Rauf** "hasn't recovered from the Yips yet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:09:00">[21:09:00]</a> and his bowling style is particularly suited to Virat Kohli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:57:00">[33:57:00]</a>.
*   **Nasim Shah** was not incisive, even if not expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:11:00">[21:11:00]</a>.
*   **Abrar Ahmed** was Pakistan's best bowler, taking 1 for 28 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>.

### Structural and Selection Issues
Pakistan suffers from fundamental issues:
*   **Lack of All-rounders:** The team effectively plays without a fifth bowler or a seventh batter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>. Khushdil Shah is categorized as an all-rounder despite averaging 83 with the ball in ODIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>.
*   **Homogeneous Batting Lineup:** Too many middle-order batters are of the same mold, leading to a predictable and slow scoring pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>.
*   **Selection Panel Power:** A five-man selection panel picks the playing XI, leaving the captain without power, which is deemed "not feasible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Depth:** Unlike other teams, Pakistan struggles significantly when key players are injured or unavailable, as they lack sufficient backup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:30:00">[22:30:00]</a>.

The match was called a "terrible advert for ODI Cricket" and "the worst possible thing for Cricket" when an [[pakistan_vs_india_champions_ Trophy_match_analysis | India vs Pakistan game]] is bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>.

## India's Dominance

### Batting Prowess
India's chase was anchored by a phenomenal performance from **Virat Kohli**:
*   He scored an unbeaten 100, his 51st ODI century, surpassing Sachin Tendulkar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:38:00">[32:38:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:41:00">[32:41:00]</a>.
*   He became the fastest to 14,000 ODI runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:45:00">[32:45:00]</a>.
*   He now has the third-most runs in international cricket, behind only Tendulkar and Sangakkara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:49:00">[32:49:00]</a>.
*   Kohli has an exceptional record against Pakistan, with 6 scores over 50 (four of which are centuries) in 17 ODI innings, and an average of 81.4 in multinational tournaments against them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:58:00">[32:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:10:00">[33:10:00]</a>.

**Rohit Sharma** and **Shubman Gill** also contributed significantly, setting up the chase and making the game "kind of over" by the time Gill departed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:26:00">[35:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:38:00">[35:38:00]</a>. **Shreyas Iyer** is noted for his improvement against the short ball and his elite performance against spin, averaging 80 against spin when facing a minimum of 1000 balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:03:00">[40:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:07:00">[42:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:27:00">[42:27:00]</a>.

### Bowling Contributions
*   **Hardik Pandya** bowled an important spell, taking 2 for 31 in 8 overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:59:00">[48:59:00]</a>. He was described as a "smart bowler" who understood the "assignment" by taking pace off the ball and bowling back of a length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:03:00">[50:03:00]</a>.
*   **Mohammed Shami** and Hardik bowled well generally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.
*   **Kuldeep Yadav** picked up wickets towards the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:05:00">[49:05:00]</a>.

## The Widening Gap Between India and Pakistan
The disparity in skill and depth between the two teams was highlighted. India has a strong talent pool, with players like Jaiswal, Ravi Bishnoi, Ruturaj Gaikwad, and Mohammed Siraj not even in the current squad, who could easily make it into the Pakistan team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:22:00">[24:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:27:00">[24:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:37:00">[24:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:41:00">[24:41:00]</a>.

The idea that Pakistan's players not frequently playing against Indian players in leagues like the IPL contributes to their underperformance was discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:27:00">[23:27:00]</a>. However, it was argued that the current gulf in skill is more significant than nerves, and few current Pakistan players would even make it into IPL teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:04:00">[57:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:46:00">[57:46:00]</a>. The problem is that Pakistan's players are not scoring quickly enough, even with financial incentives to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:10:00">[59:10:00]</a>.

Pakistan's theme for this Champions Trophy was "putting viewers to sleep" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>. They are considered "a good light year behind in limited overs Cricket" compared to India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:06:00">[30:06:00]</a>. The conversation noted that while Pakistan made a T20 World Cup final less than three years ago, injuries to key players like Shaheen Afridi have severely impacted the team since then <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:57:00">[57:57:00]</a>.

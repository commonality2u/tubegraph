The World Cup final between India and South Africa was described as a "weird and spasmodic and confusing" game, yet it delivered a close contest from beginning to end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. India managed to break their "hoodoo" against South Africa, a team with a historical "OG curse in world cricket" at major tournaments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## India's Innings

The match started with a questionable first over from Marco Jansen, who bowled wide and full deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, allowing India to score early boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. Despite a strong start, South Africa quickly fought back, securing three early wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Rohit Sharma was caught off a sweep shot, and Rishabh Pant was dismissed off a full toss he mishit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. South Africa's early success led to Aiden Markram bowling a part-time over in the sixth over of the power play, a decision viewed as an oversight given the strong position they were in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

Axar Patel's role in the middle order was ambiguous, functioning as a "pinch blocker or a pinch hitter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. South Africa's bowlers, particularly Marco Jansen, appeared "spooked" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, and they struggled to bowl in the right areas, often pitching the ball up when they should have been "banging the ball into the pitch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

### The "Shrinkage as Kohli" Innings

Virat Kohli's innings was a key point of discussion, characterized as a "shring as Coley innings" due to its uncertain impact on the game's outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. He aimed to bat through the innings, but his slow pace meant he "chewed up extra balls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. While India reached a decent score, it was unclear if his strike rate (128) was beneficial or detrimental until the very end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>. The speaker estimated the pitch to be a 165 par wicket, which India exceeded, but not necessarily due to exceptional batting performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a>.

Shivam Dube's quickfire 27 off 16 balls was crucial, forcing South Africa away from their spin bowlers and back to pace options like Marco Jansen, who then conceded 17 runs in an over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>.

## South Africa's Chase

Jasprit Bumrah's bowling was exceptional, with one delivery to Reza Hendricks described as "unfair," angling in to take the top of off stump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. Arshdeep Singh also contributed with a wicket, leading to Tristan Stubbs coming in early in the power play, a random but significant moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:09:02]</a>.

Axar Patel bowled a "genius" slower ball to dismiss Stubbs, a delivery not typically associated with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Despite India taking early wickets, the ball was "coming on so beautifully" for the South African batsmen against the spinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

### Klaasen's Onslaught and the Turning Point

The partnership between Heinrich Klaasen and David Miller became critical as they are South Africa's "two best players of Spin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. Klaasen began hitting sixes "everywhere," making the game seem "gone" for India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

The actual biggest swing moment of the game occurred with Rishabh Pant's knee injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. The subsequent break, used to attend to Pant, created a crucial pause in play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Immediately after the break, Arshdeep Singh bowled a "wide length ball" which Klaasen edged behind, completely changing the momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

Rohit Sharma then made the decision to bring Bumrah back, seeing it as the "last chance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:46">[00:33:46]</a>. Bumrah delivered, dismissing Marco Jansen with a ball that angled in and took the stumps, exposing [[challenges_faced_by_south_africa_cricket_team | South Africa]]'s tail-end weakness at positions 7, 8, and 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

Hardik Pandya then bowled a "bad ball" – a wide full toss – which David Miller hit high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. Suryakumar Yadav took a "fantastic" catch on the boundary, reminiscent of Kapil Dev's catch in 1983, despite some debate about whether he touched the boundary rope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. This catch sealed India's World Cup victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

## Analysis and Outcomes

India's victory was attributed to their shift in intent, playing with a "level of intent that I thought wasn't always there in some of those other World Cup knockout games" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>, such as against [[review_of_india_vs_england_cricket_test_match | England in the World Cup semi-final in Australia]] or [[challenges_faced_by_australia_in_the_semifinal_against_india | Australia in the last World Cup semi-final]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>. They actively sought wickets and allowed players like Axar to be aggressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>.

For [[challenges_faced_by_south_africa_cricket_team | South Africa]], the loss highlighted their persistent weakness in major tournaments, particularly their lower batting order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>. Despite being in a winning position (needing 30 from 30 with 6 wickets in hand) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:37">[01:16:37]</a>, they faltered, with strategic errors like Maharaj taking a single off Bumrah's last ball, exposing the weaker tail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:07">[00:35:07]</a>.

Hardik Pandya's performance with the ball was critical, dismissing both Klaasen and Miller, despite previous doubts about his place in the squad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">[00:37:42]</a>. His ability to bowl effectively when the frontline spinners were being targeted was a game-changer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.

The match was recognized as one of the greatest World Cup finals of all time, potentially in the top three alongside the 2019 and 2016 finals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:57">[01:20:57]</a>. Jasprit Bumrah was considered the Player of the Series, while Heinrich Klaasen was arguably the Player of the Match for his outstanding innings, though the award typically goes to the top scorer from the winning side, likely Virat Kohli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:50">[01:41:50]</a>.

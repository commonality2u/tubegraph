The final saw key [[Role and impact of key players in the match | individual performances]] and strategic decisions heavily influence the outcome.

## Australia's Key Players

### Travis Head
[[Performance of specific players in T20 World Cup 2024 | Travis Head]] played a pivotal role in Australia's victory, earning Player of the Match honors in both the semi-final and final <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>.
*   **Early Struggles & Luck**: Early in his innings, Head appeared vulnerable, looking like he might get dismissed "every single ball" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This "bit of luck" is sometimes necessary in big games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Batting Dominance**: He went on to score 137 runs off 120 deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>, hitting more boundaries than the entire Indian team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. His aggressive approach, willing to take on bowlers like Jasprit Bumrah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:58">[01:28:58]</a>, highlighted his transformed game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:05">[01:29:05]</a>.
*   **Fielding Impact**: Despite being considered a "substat of Fielder" who sometimes "Daydreams" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, Head took a crucial catch in the final <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>.
*   **Legacy**: Head's performances in the World Test Championship final and both World Cup knockout games established him as a "multiformat superstar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:09">[01:27:09]</a>, emulating Mark Waugh's achievement of being Player of the Match in both the semi-final and final in 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:12">[01:27:12]</a>.

### Marnus Labuschagne
[[Performance of specific players in T20 World Cup 2024 | Marnus Labuschagne]], who was not initially expected to be in the World Cup squad, played a vital "test innings" of 58 off 110 balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:36">[01:30:36]</a>, consolidating the innings from one end while Head attacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:43">[01:30:43]</a>. He entered the crease with Australia at 47 for 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:49">[01:30:49]</a>, at a point when India was ahead in win percentages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:52">[01:30:52]</a>. His performance was crucial in steadying the innings.

### Pat Cummins (Captaincy & Bowling)
Pat Cummins's captaincy was lauded for his bold decision to bowl first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   **Bowling Performance**: Cummins delivered a crucial spell, conceding no boundaries in his 10 overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:41">[00:56:41]</a> and taking the wicket of [[Role and performance of key players like Bumrah Shami and Gill in the World Cup | Virat Kohli]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:41">[00:56:41]</a>, which dramatically silenced the home crowd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:41">[00:56:41]</a>.
*   **Tactics**: He employed an unconventional "cockin" style of constantly changing bowlers, which kept India under pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:20">[00:43:20]</a>, although some of his decisions, like taking Mitch Marsh off when he was getting something from the pitch, could be questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>. This tactic of changing bowlers frequently was intentionally designed to make it harder for batters to play on "autopilot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:21">[01:29:21]</a>.
*   **Leadership**: Cummins's ability to "silence" the massive home crowd was a testament to his mental fortitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:11">[00:57:11]</a>. He has led Australia to multiple major titles, including the World T20 in 2021, the Ashes at home, the World Test Championship final, retention of the Ashes in England, and now the ODI World Cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

### Other Australian Bowlers
*   **Mitchell Starc**: Despite previously complaining about two new balls, Mitchell Starc took 6 wickets in the two knockout games, performing exceptionally when it mattered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:24">[01:20:24]</a>.
*   **Adam Zampa**: Adam Zampa had an incredible tournament, taking 22 wickets in the round robin stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:07">[01:20:07]</a>, though his wicket-taking rate dipped slightly in the knockout games (one wicket in each) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:09">[01:20:09]</a>. He is considered the best limited-overs leg spinner Australia has had since Shane Warne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:27">[01:22:27]</a>.

### Fielding
Australia's fielding was "absolutely Relentless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:17">[00:44:17]</a>, exerting significant pressure on the Indian batters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:24">[00:44:24]</a>. Their field placements were aggressive, forcing batters to hit hard even for singles, increasing the chance of errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>.

## India's Key Players and Challenges

### Rohit Sharma (Captaincy & Batting)
[[Role and performance of key players like Bumrah Shami and Gill in the World Cup | Rohit Sharma]] played an aggressive innings of 47 off 31 deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:20">[01:05:20]</a>, prioritizing power play hitting to provide a "launch pad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:23">[01:05:23]</a>. He spoke with class after the match, admitting India did not manage to get enough runs on the board and refusing to make excuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>.

### Virat Kohli
[[Role and performance of key players like Bumrah Shami and Gill in the World Cup | Virat Kohli]], despite scoring 54 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:06">[01:09:06]</a>, and achieving the record for most runs in a single World Cup edition (765) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:58">[01:08:58]</a>, slowed down significantly during his innings with KL Rahul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This was partly due to the team's perceived "weakness" at number eight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, leading to a conservative mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a> and a failure to put pressure back on Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:15">[00:29:15]</a>.

### KL Rahul
[[Role and performance of key players like Bumrah Shami and Gill in the World Cup | KL Rahul]] scored 66 off 107 balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:42">[01:05:42]</a>, playing a very slow, almost "test innings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:02">[01:06:02]</a>. While he aimed to soak pressure and set up a late charge, this "kick never came" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>. He also struggled with wicketkeeping in the final, missing some "regulation takes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:27">[01:07:27]</a>, possibly due to nerves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:25">[01:07:25]</a> and the difficult pitch conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:43">[01:07:43]</a>.

### Bowling Unit
*   **Mohammed Shami**: After a stellar tournament, [[Role and performance of key players like Bumrah Shami and Gill in the World Cup | Mohammed Shami]] struggled with the new ball in the final, perhaps due to bowling with a slightly older ball previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:13">[01:28:13]</a>. His best utility was arguably as first change bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>.
*   **Mohammed Siraj**: Rohit Sharma's decision to bring [[Role and performance of key players like Bumrah Shami and Gill in the World Cup | Mohammed Siraj]] on later in the innings (17th over) was questioned, as his "best utility is with the new ball" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>.
*   **Spinners**: Kuldeep Yadav's form tailed off slightly at the end of the tournament, looking "a little bit slow, a little bit tired" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:51">[01:19:51]</a>. Ravindra Jadeja bowled one great ball that spun sideways but missed leg stump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:32">[01:19:32]</a>.

### Batting Depth and Mindset
India's batting lineup lacked a strong number eight, which contributed to Virat Kohli's decision to bat slower as he didn't feel comfortable with [[Role and performance of key players like Bumrah Shami and Gill in the World Cup | Mohammed Shami]] at that position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:06">[01:01:06]</a>. This perceived weakness, whether real or not, turned into a mental weakness for the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:28">[01:01:28]</a>. The team's tendency to become "conservative" under pressure, rather than attacking, has been a recurring issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>.

## Conclusion

The [[T20 World Cup 2024 final match analysis | World Cup final]] showcased Australia's ability to "solve like a million problems" throughout the tournament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:33">[00:33:33]</a>, while India, with a smooth journey, didn't face many challenges until the final <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. This "battle hardening" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a> and collective top-level performance from most of their players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>, combined with crucial moments of luck and individual brilliance from players like Travis Head, sealed their victory. India's inability to put enough pressure back on Australia, partly due to the psychological impact of their batting depth and the uncharacteristic slowing down of key batters, ultimately contributed to their defeat.

Cricket team selection, particularly in the context of creating an "all-star" or "best-of" team, involves various [[criteria_for_ranking_cricket_players | criteria]] and [[methods_of_evaluating_cricket_players | methods of evaluation]]. For a "current Asian test team," emphasis is placed on [[evaluating_current_cricket_players_across_formats | current form]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, with the format specifically chosen to highlight this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Key Selection Criteria

### Current Form and Recent Performance
A primary criterion is a player's recent performance. For example, Kusal Mendis was considered a top pick due to his outstanding current form, accumulating 943 runs at an average of 94.3 in seven tests "this year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, and reaching 1,000 runs in eight test matches with five tons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Similarly, Jasprit Bumrah's 41 wickets in nine tests at an average of 16 highlighted his strong recent performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Shubman Gill's current form, averaging 47.4 in Test Cricket for the calendar year, led to his selection despite prior criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

### Statistical Performance
Player statistics, such as runs scored, batting averages, wickets taken, and bowling averages, are crucial for evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Batting Statistics**: Yashasvi Jaiswal was noted for averaging 56+ in 14 test matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Saud Shakeel's "million runs" over the last couple of years was a key factor for his selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. Salman Ali Agha's batting average of 46 in 17 test matches, exceeding Babar Azam's current average, supported his inclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.
*   **Bowling Statistics**: Jasprit Bumrah's career average of 20.57 from 173 wickets in 40 tests is a significant indicator of his effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Hassan Mahmud was selected based on his 23 wickets at an average of 30 in seven games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.

### Player Roles and Versatility
A player's ability to fill specific [[cricketing_roles_and_player_performance_assessment | roles]] and their versatility are important considerations. Kusal Mendis's ability to bat anywhere from 4 to 7 adds flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Rishabh Pant is valued as a "match winner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Spinners like Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja are preferred for their batting capabilities, offering an "extra bowler" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

### Performance in Different Conditions
A player's ability to perform across various conditions is also a factor. Kusal Mendis's ton in England indicates he's an "all conditions batter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Asitha Fernando was praised for carrying Sri Lanka's attack "not just in Sri Lanka but overseas as well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. While Saud Shakeel has excellent stats, concerns exist about his performance when "traveling around the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>, particularly against moving balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

### Intangibles and Qualitative Contributions
Beyond raw numbers, qualitative aspects can influence selection. Asitha Fernando, despite possibly not having the highest wicket count, was noted for doing "a lot of the grunt work for Sri Lanka in Test Cricket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Yashasvi Jaiswal is described as "extremely aesthetically pleasing to watch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Rishabh Pant is seen as a "beacon of hope" who scores runs regularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

### Player Availability and Fitness
A player's current availability due to fitness is also a consideration. Mohammed Shami was considered for the team but might not qualify if not "currently available for test selection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.

### Opposition and Match-up Considerations
The impact of player selection on the opponent's strategy can be a subtle factor. Choosing an "unorthodox" or "wild card" player can keep the opposition "guessing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>. Deciding when to deploy express pace or a "mystery spinner" falls under [[cricket_strategies_and_player_techniques | strategic thinking]] in team management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>.

### Team Composition and Balance
Building a balanced team involves considering combinations of players. The discussion about having multiple Indian players or Sri Lankan players, and the desire to include players from Bangladesh, indicates an awareness of national representation and team balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. The overlap of strengths (e.g., middle-order batters) across Asian teams highlights the challenge of selection and the "not easy anywhere to find top order players" in modern cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>. The need for a specific number of bowlers (e.g., a "third seamer") drives later picks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>.

## Example of a Drafted Team

This team reflects the application of the discussed [[analysis_of_strategies_for_t20_team_selection | selection criteria]], including current form, statistical performance, role versatility, and a balanced composition of batters, all-rounders, and bowlers.

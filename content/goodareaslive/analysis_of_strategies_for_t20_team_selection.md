Episode 29 of the Crick Piics podcast focuses on the intense topic of creating the best current T20 World 12, emphasizing [[form_and_strategy_adjustments_in_t20_cricket | current form]] over [[cricket_strategies_and_game_analysis | past records]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. The selection process follows a snake-style draft competition, with each of the three participants receiving four picks to build a 12-man squad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

## Key Selection Criteria

The primary criteria for player selection are:
*   **Current Form** Players must be in top form in the present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.
*   **Active Players** Only currently active cricketers are eligible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. Sunil Narine was deemed ineligible because he has not made himself available for the West Indies national team despite his [[techniques_and_strategies_in_t20_cricket_batting | batting]] form in the IPL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:50:00">[20:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:07:00">[21:07:00]</a>. Glenn Maxwell, despite past performance, was also ruled out due to his current "appalling form" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:40:00">[21:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:49:00">[21:49:00]</a>.
*   **Role Clarity** The ability of a player to perform a specific [[player_roles_and_strategies_in_t20_cricket | role]] within the team is highly valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>, especially for openers who "gun it as hard as you can" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>.

## Player Selections and Justifications

### Jasprit Bumrah
*   **Selection:** Unanimous first pick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.
*   **Justification:** Considered the best all-format cricketer, currently peaking in T20s, unplayable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. He can bowl in all phases of the game, maintain a dry line, and is an out-and-out wicket-taker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. His unique angle and release point make him highly successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:11:00">[22:11:00]</a>.

### Travis Head
*   **Selection:** Picked as an opener <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.
*   **Justification:** Epitomizes modern T20 [[techniques_and_strategies_in_t20_cricket_batting | batting]], going "berserk" from the first ball, taking the game by the scruff of its neck in the power play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>. Praised for his [[cricket_strategies_and_player_techniques | clean ball striking]] and "predator mode" mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>. He is a "big game player" performing well in significant matches like the World Cup final and World Test Championship final <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.

### Heinrich Klaasen
*   **Selection:** Chosen for the middle order, with potential wicket-keeping duties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>.
*   **Justification:** Considered the best current batter in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>, having a massive impact on South Africa's performance. He can handle tough situations and is adept at chasing targets, being able to "absolutely go berserk" in the middle and later overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>. His dominance against spin is highlighted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>, along with his unique "back foot straight pull" shot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>. His ability to score quickly while staying in for extended periods makes him a "cheat code" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>.

### Suryakumar Yadav ("Sky")
*   **Selection:** Positioned at number three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:17:00">[17:17:00]</a>.
*   **Justification:** Has "disrupted the game" and "changed T20 cricket" with his 360-degree play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:39:00">[17:39:00]</a>. His exotic style allows him to score all around the wicket, unaffected by length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:53:00">[17:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:58:00">[17:58:00]</a>. His match-winning half-century on a tough New York pitch demonstrated his pedigree in difficult conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:07:00">[18:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:14:00">[19:14:00]</a>.

### Matheesha Pathirana
*   **Selection:** Chosen as a "gun bowler" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:11:00">[22:11:00]</a>.
*   **Justification:** Considered the best strike bowler in white-ball cricket after Bumrah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:20:00">[22:20:00]</a>. His unique angle and release point are major strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:48:00">[22:48:00]</a>, making him hard to face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:02:00">[23:02:00]</a>. He has shown excellent current form in the IPL and for Sri Lanka, clocking speeds of 150 km/h <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:20:00">[23:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:02:00">[24:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:11:00">[25:11:00]</a>. He possesses a full skill set, including a slow ball and bouncer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:27:00">[25:27:00]</a>.

### Andre Russell
*   **Selection:** Included as an all-rounder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:06:00">[26:06:00]</a>.
*   **Justification:** Still going strong, highly experienced with the ball, especially effective with short balls in the middle overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:12:00">[26:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:21:00">[26:21:00]</a>. Despite being less effective as a death bowler, he can pick up wickets and is a "gun fielder" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:35:00">[26:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:05:00">[27:05:00]</a>. His [[techniques_and_strategies_in_t20_cricket_batting | batting]] is "ludicrous" and he can adapt his game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:07:00">[27:07:00]</a>, hitting some of the hardest sixes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:22:00">[27:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:32:00">[28:32:00]</a>. He is considered almost a blueprint for an all-round T20 cricketer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:47:00">[27:47:00]</a>.

### Jos Buttler
*   **Selection:** Chosen as an opener and wicketkeeper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:36:00">[29:36:00]</a>.
*   **Justification:** Despite some hot-and-cold periods, his impactful innings for Rajasthan in the IPL proved his value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:40:00">[29:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:53:00">[29:53:00]</a>. He is versatile, able to play through different gears as per the game situation, and is a strong leader, making him a captaincy candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:06:00">[30:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:10:00">[30:10:00]</a>. His killer reverse sweep and ability to score quickly in tough conditions are highlighted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:31:00">[30:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:47:00">[30:47:00]</a>. He can play both aggressive and anchor-type innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:19:00">[31:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:41:00">[31:41:00]</a>.

### Nicholas Pooran
*   **Selection:** Selected as a middle-order batter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:25:00">[32:25:00]</a>.
*   **Justification:** Considered the best striker of the ball after Heinrich Klaasen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:30:00">[32:30:00]</a>. He can also keep wickets, offering flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:35:00">[32:35:00]</a>. His left-handed option in the middle order is important for matchups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:12:00">[33:12:00]</a>. He can play at the top of the order or as a finisher, and once he starts hitting, "he doesn't stop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:22:00">[33:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:44:00">[33:44:00]</a>.

### Rashid Khan
*   **Selection:** Chosen as a leg-spinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:11:00">[35:11:00]</a>.
*   **Justification:** Has been consistently good for a long time with few dips in form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:45:00">[35:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:50:00">[35:50:00]</a>. His [[techniques_and_strategies_in_t20_cricket_batting | batting]] has improved, allowing him to clear boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:19:00">[35:19:00]</a>. His exceptional fielding is also noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:05:00">[36:05:00]</a>. Considered by some to be the best wrist spinner in T20 cricket, capable of bowling in any phase (power play, death) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:15:00">[36:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:25:00">[37:25:00]</a>.

### Trent Boult
*   **Selection:** Picked as a new ball bowler and left-arm seamer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:40:00">[38:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:47:00">[38:47:00]</a>.
*   **Justification:** Despite New Zealand's early exit from the World Cup, his bowling was "unplayable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:51:00">[38:51:00]</a>, with excellent returns in terms of economy and wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:58:00">[38:58:00]</a>. He maintains eligibility by not officially retiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:12:00">[39:12:00]</a>. His left-arm angle and ability to swing the ball, particularly to get a wicket in the first over, are valuable skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:25:00">[39:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:11:00">[41:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:18:00">[41:18:00]</a>.

### David Miller
*   **Selection:** Included as a middle-order batter, particularly for the number six position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:53:00">[42:53:00]</a>.
*   **Justification:** His current form is strong, and he's capable of playing "two things": staying in when the team is in trouble and hitting big when needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:56:00">[42:56:00]</a>. He played one of the best innings of the T20 World Cup on a tough New York pitch against the Netherlands, demonstrating his ability to adapt and perform in challenging conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:02:00">[43:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:16:00">[43:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:32:00">[43:32:00]</a>.

## Considerations for Team Balance

The team aims for a balance of [[player_roles_and_strategies_in_t20_cricket | player roles and strategies in T20 cricket]], including batting depth, bowling variety, and left-handed options.
*   The final proposed team lineup is: Travis Head, Jos Buttler, Suryakumar Yadav, Nicholas Pooran, Heinrich Klaasen, David Miller, Andre Russell, Rashid Khan, Jasprit Bumrah, Trent Boult, and Matheesha Pathirana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:10:00">[51:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:18:00">[53:18:00]</a>.
*   **Batting Depth:** The team features explosive batters in the top five <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:02:00">[40:02:00]</a>, with Miller, Russell, and Rashid Khan providing further hitting power and versatility in the lower middle order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:18:00">[37:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:41:00">[47:41:00]</a>.
*   **Bowling Variety:** The team includes a mix of fast bowlers (Bumrah, Pathirana, Boult) and spin options (Rashid Khan). The inclusion of a left-arm seamer like Trent Boult addresses the need for variety in the pace attack, especially with the new ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:40:00">[38:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:25:00">[39:25:00]</a>.

## Alternative and Debated Selections

Several players were considered but ultimately not picked, often due to strict adherence to the "current form" rule:
*   **Kuldeep Yadav:** Picked by one participant, but debated by others as not being in the "top four spinners" currently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:22:00">[14:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22:00">[15:22:00]</a>. He offers a left-arm wrist spin option with good control and wicket-taking ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:00">[16:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26:00">[16:26:00]</a>. He is considered the 12th man in the final combined team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:42:00">[51:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:33:00">[53:33:00]</a>.
*   **Virat Kohli:** Acknowledged for his strong IPL performance but his "atrocious" T20 World Cup form in New York led to his exclusion from the current top three batters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:22:00">[44:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:02:00">[45:02:00]</a>. His exceptional fielding is also noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:36:00">[50:36:00]</a>.
*   **Adam Zampa & Wanindu Hasaranga:** Other leg-spin options considered alongside Rashid Khan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:35:00">[35:35:00]</a>. Hasaranga's recent [[form_and_strategy_adjustments_in_t20_cricket | batting form]] dip in the T20 World Cup made him ineligible for a specialist batting role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:33:00">[41:33:00]</a>.
*   **Phil Salt:** Considered a strong opening batter option, with a toss-up between him and Travis Head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:31:00">[48:31:00]</a>.
*   **Sikandar Raza:** Mentioned as a potential 12th man, offering an off-spinning option and handy [[techniques_and_strategies_in_t20_cricket_batting | batting]], but his team's absence from the World Cup put him at a disadvantage for "current form" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:11:00">[47:11:00]</a>.
*   **Mustafizur Rahman ("Fizz"):** Acknowledged for his good form in recent months, especially in the IPL, and his difficulty to score off in slow conditions due to his wrist variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:36:00">[49:36:00]</a>.

The final consolidated World 12 chosen by the hosts combines their best picks, reflecting a strong batting lineup, versatile all-rounders, and a balanced pace and spin attack based on players' current performances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:18:00">[53:18:00]</a>.

India secured a comfortable four-wicket victory over New Zealand in the Champions Trophy final with an over to spare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:30">[02:51:30]</a>. This win marks a significant turning point for [[indias_performance_in_icc_events | India's performance in ICC events]], ending an 11-year drought for ICC trophies, despite consistently reaching knockout stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. Following this win, India has now claimed two back-to-back limited-overs ICC trophies within months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.

## Unprecedented Dominance
In the last three ICC tournaments over 18 months, India has only lost a solitary game, specifically against Travis Head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. They were expected to win all three tournaments without a single loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. Their consistent strong performance in bilateral cricket over a six to eight-year period indicates they are genuinely a very good team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.

This Indian side is currently considered by many to be the best limited-overs international team by a country mile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:59:00">[12:59:00]</a>. They were just one game away from achieving the "Triple Crown" if they had won the ODI World Cup unbeaten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05:00">[13:05:00]</a>. The team from 2023 to 2025 has been hailed as potentially India's greatest-ever white-ball side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>.

### Team Strengths
India's current squad boasts remarkable depth and talent across all departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:00">[14:43:00]</a>.
*   **Batting**:
    *   Shubman Gill is the world's number one ODI batter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47:00">[14:47:00]</a>.
    *   [[rohit_sharma_3_0 | Rohit Sharma 3.0]] has undergone a significant transformation, sacrificing his runs for the team's benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:50:00">[42:50:00]</a>. His powerplay strike rate jumped from 72 (2013-2021) to 120 (2022 onwards) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:27:00">[44:27:00]</a>, and he averages 20 more runs in the powerplay now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:40:00">[45:40:00]</a>.
    *   Virat Kohli is one of the greatest players ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59:00">[13:59:00]</a>.
    *   Shreyas Iyer has become a quintessential number four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a>.
    *   KL Rahul has silenced critics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:00]</a>, averaging 48 or 49 in ODI cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:00">[14:41:00]</a>.
    *   All-rounders like Ravindra Jadeja and Hardik Pandya provide proper batting depth until number eight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:08:00">[14:08:00]</a>.
*   **Bowling**:
    *   The spin quartet of Varun Chakravarthy, Kuldeep Yadav, Ravindra Jadeja, and Axar Patel is considered ridiculously difficult to play, especially in favorable conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:59:00">[35:59:00]</a>. In the final, Indian spinners bowled 38 overs, taking five wickets for 144 runs, an economy rate of less than four runs per over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:43:00">[35:43:00]</a>.
    *   Kuldeep Yadav bowled a crucial spell in the final, removing Rachin Ravindra and Kane Williamson in quick succession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:12:00">[15:12:00]</a>.
    *   Jasprit Bumrah is described as perhaps one of the greatest strike bowlers of all time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:37:00">[18:37:00]</a>.
    *   Hardik Pandya offers a second seam option, capable of bowling across all phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:49:00">[18:49:00]</a>.
*   **Squad Depth**: Players like Yashasvi Jaiswal (who would make most international opening lineups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:31:00">[15:31:00]</a>) and Mohammed Siraj (who would play for most teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:49:00">[15:49:00]</a>) were not in the playing XI, showcasing the immense talent pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">[14:17:00]</a>.

## The Final Match vs. New Zealand
New Zealand won the toss and elected to bat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:49:00">[48:49:00]</a>. They were handicapped by the loss of Matt Henry, the tournament's leading wicket-taker, before the final <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:05:00">[23:05:00]</a>. New Zealand felt they were 25-30 runs short of a competitive total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:22:00">[23:22:00]</a>. The pitch became tougher to bat on in the second innings, showing increased average turn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:34:00">[23:34:00]</a>. However, India's blistering start, scoring 100 for no loss in 17 overs, meant they were never behind in the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:41:00">[23:41:00]</a>.

### New Zealand's Performance
*   **Daryl Mitchell's Innings**: Mitchell scored 63 off 101 balls, which was criticized as a detrimental knock due to its slow strike rate, especially a 91-ball fifty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:36:00">[30:36:00]</a>. His lack of intent and struggle to pick up the ball affected New Zealand's total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:07:00">[31:07:07]</a>.
*   **Fielding**: While New Zealand is generally a strong fielding side, they dropped two crucial catches in the final, including Shubman Gill on six runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:29:00">[27:29:00]</a>. This was detrimental given India was chasing a sub-250 target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:02:00">[29:02:00]</a>.
*   **Bowling**: New Zealand's seamers, particularly Ben Sears, struggled to hit their lengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:42:00">[29:42:00]</a>. Nathan Smith's inclusion was questioned, as he has a high economy rate in ODIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:12:00">[38:12:00]</a>.

### Rohit Sharma's Captaincy and Batting
[[rohit_sharma_3_0 | Rohit Sharma's]] captaincy was lauded for his proactive decisions, such as bringing in Varun Chakravarthy early in the powerplay for a wicket and Kuldeep Yadav immediately after the powerplay to pick up crucial wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:19:00">[43:19:00]</a>. His 41-ball 50, ending with 76 runs, ensured India was well ahead of the required run rate, allowing other batters to contribute without needing an "all-timer" knock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:10:00">[47:10:00]</a>.

## Context and Controversy
The tournament itself faced criticism for its planning, cancellation history, and venue changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>. One team even refused to play in the original host country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. Despite the controversy and the "nonsense" surrounding the tournament, the favored team, India, ultimately won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>.

Critics and even casual sports fans expressed anger over how the tournament played out, with some suggesting an "asterisk" should be placed next to India's title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. However, the Indian team itself does not deserve an asterisk, as they were the best performing team and favorites by a mile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>. The issues stem from the politics and financial interests of organizations like the ICC and BCCI, not the players' performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>.

### The Toss Controversy
India's captain Rohit Sharma lost the toss for the 15th time in a row, a streak of 12 consecutive tosses lost by him personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:59:00">[19:59:00]</a>. The probability of this happening is an astonishing 0.003% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:08:00">[20:08:00]</a>. The last time India won a toss in ODI cricket, they hadn't won either of their recent limited-overs trophies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:13:00">[20:13:00]</a>. This unusual streak has even led to conspiracy theories about fixed tosses, especially during the 2023 World Cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:31:00">[20:31:00]</a>.

## Individual Accolades
While Rachin Ravindra won the Player of the Tournament award <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:00:00">[40:00:00]</a>, Shreyas Iyer was also a strong contender, being India's highest scorer and the tournament's second-highest scorer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:39:00">[40:39:00]</a>. Iyer's ability to take down spin and conquer his weakness against short-pitched bowling made him a vital asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:54:00">[40:54:00]</a>.

India's win solidifies their position as a formidable white-ball cricket team, showcasing their depth, strategic evolution, and remarkable individual performances.

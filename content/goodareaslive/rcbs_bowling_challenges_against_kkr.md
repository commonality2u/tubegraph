Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) demonstrated a noticeable struggle in their bowling attack, particularly in their match against Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:11">[01:16:11]</a>. This performance highlighted ongoing concerns regarding their ability to take wickets consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

## Initial Bowling Performance and Wicket-Taking Concerns

RCB's bowling was initially described as "horrendous," characterized by incorrect lines and lengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>. While Josh Hazlewood appeared effective, the rest of the attack struggled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. The team's wickets largely came as a result of KKR's aggressive pursuit of a high score (230-240 runs) and subsequent collapse, rather than sustained, penetrating bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. This suggests a need for RCB to "manufacture wickets a little bit more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. The relatively inexperienced captaincy also contributes to the challenge of managing a tough bowling lineup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.

### Individual Bowler Analysis

*   **Suyash Sharma**: Initially bowled flat balls outside off stump, giving away significant width and easy scoring options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>. His performance improved when he started bowling straighter, on the stumps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>.
*   **Venkatesh Iyer**: Over-pitched, which allowed Phil Salt to attack effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:03:00">[28:03:00]</a>. He tends to struggle against unconventional batters like Salt or Heinrich Klaasen, who can hit the ball in different ways, unlike traditional batters who might be cramped by his typical lengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:20:00">[28:20:00]</a>.

## KKR's Collapse and RCB's Adapted Bowling

While RCB's bowling was initially poor, they managed to pull it back in the latter half of the game. This shift forced KKR batters to take risks even from "good balls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:00:00">[21:00:00]</a>. However, many KKR wickets were attributed to batter error rather than exceptional bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:58:00">[17:58:00]</a>. Key dismissals included Sunil Narine and Ajinkya Rahane attempting to swing, Kuldip Pandia playing back onto his stumps, and Rinku Singh, Andre Russell, and Ramandeep Singh pushing too hard and losing consistent wickets across overs 10, 11, 13, 15, and 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:18:00">[18:18:00]</a>. KKR's aggressive setup, with lower-order hitters like Rinku Singh, Andre Russell, and Ramandeep Singh, aims to go "really really hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>. Their failure on this particular day meant they fell short of a par score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>.

## The Due Factor and Chasing

The [[challenges_for_bangladeshs_cricket_team | due factor]] significantly impacts chasing statistics in T20 cricket, making chases easier due to the slippery ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:36:00">[26:36:00]</a>. While the prospect of using multiple dry balls could potentially alleviate this, it's not a guaranteed solution as ball lacquer might behave differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:42:00">[27:42:00]</a>. This factor, combined with teams scoring "20 or 30 or 40 under par," contributes to the perception of easier chases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:46:00">[26:46:00]</a>.

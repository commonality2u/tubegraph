Hardik Pandya plays a significant role in India's ODI cricket team, particularly with his bowling.

## Bowling Performance and Role

Pandya functions as a high-performing fifth bowler for India in One Day Internationals (ODIs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. His typical bowling record against most opponents shows him taking a wicket every 39 deliveries, with an economy rate of 5.62 runs per over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. He has also occasionally served as a sixth bowling option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

However, when playing against Pakistan, Pandya's performance elevates him to the level of a frontline bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. In these matches, he takes a wicket every 29 balls and maintains an economy rate of under five runs per over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

### Recent Match Impact

In a recent match, Hardik Pandya and Mohammed Shami were praised for their effective bowling, successfully stemming the flow of runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Pandya's wicket of Babar Azam was noted, with the analysis suggesting he is adept at drawing batters in with wide deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. His more impactful bowling, which helped set up the game, came after this initial wicket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

While not necessarily considered the "best" bowler in the specific match, Pandya was deemed the most impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:35">[00:56:35]</a>. His and Mohammad Shami's tandem bowling after an injury scare to Shami was credited with setting up the game for [[indias_dominance_in_odi_cricket | India]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:12">[00:57:12]</a>.

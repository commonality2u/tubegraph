India's approach to bowling in One Day Internationals (ODIs) often involves strategic choices in player selection and deployment, particularly in the middle overs. Recent performances have highlighted strengths and posed questions regarding optimal combinations, especially concerning seamers and spinners.

## Overall Performance and Challenges
In a recent match against Bangladesh, India's bowling saw a period without taking wickets between overs 10 and 40, a pattern observed in the World Cup final as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. This has raised questions about the ideal usage and selection of their bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. The pitch in this particular match was noted as being trickier to bat on, especially in the middle period, due to the ball not consistently coming onto the bat as expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>.

## Key Bowlers

### Mohammed Shami
Mohammed Shami is regarded as a fantastic bowler and forms a great duo with Jasprit Bumrah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. He is considered one of the best attacking bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
His statistics highlight his impact:
*   Took 200 wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   Takes a wicket every 19 balls when playing with Bumrah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   Has an economy rate of 5.76 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   Ranked as the best strike bowler in ODI history when adjusted for era, with a wicket every 25.1 deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. This places him just ahead of Ajantha Mendis and nearly identical to Waqar Younis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   He excels in ICC events, where 29.7% of his wickets come from just 18.3% of his games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   In ICC events, he has 60 wickets with an economy of 5.14, taking a wicket every 15.5 deliveries (approximately every three overs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
*   His impressive record often goes overlooked due to injuries and the presence of Bumrah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>.

### Jasprit Bumrah
Jasprit Bumrah is described as probably the greatest white-ball bowler and the best defensive bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   Takes a wicket every 36 balls when playing with Shami <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   Maintains an economy rate of 4.67 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

### Spin Options: Kuldeep Yadav vs. Varun Chakravarthy
India faces a choice between Kuldeep Yadav and Varun Chakravarthy for their spin attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.
*   **Kuldeep Yadav**: Has 174 wickets and is a great strike bowler, taking a wicket every 31.4 balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>. However, he appears to be a "step away from his best" currently, possibly due to returning from injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>.
*   **Varun Chakravarthy**: Is believed to have found a level of bowling unique for white-ball bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. Despite the perception that he might be easy to "work out" over 10 overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>, teams are not handling him particularly well in List A cricket over longer periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

[!ATTENTION]
The pitch in the Bangladesh match was deemed better for wrist-spinners than finger-spinners, which could favor Chakravarthy's bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:25">[00:30:25]</a>. If India continues to struggle in the middle overs, a swap from Kuldeep to Chakravarthy is anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.

## Seamer Selection: Harshit Rana vs. Arshdeep Singh
India aims to go into matches with two specialist seam bowlers, along with Hardik Pandya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. This requires careful consideration of roles.
*   **Arshdeep Singh**: Good at taking wickets in the bowling power play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a> and at his best in that phase in T20 cricket (IPL and T20 Internationals) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. He can be "a little loose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a> and go for runs in the middle overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.
*   **Harshit Rana**: Good in the middle overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a> and at his best in the middle phase in T20 cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. He has gone for runs in the power play so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. His figures at the death might look bad, but this is influenced by particularly high-scoring wickets in the last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.

[!INFO]
The choice between Arshdeep and Harshit depends on the desired role: Arshdeep for power play wickets, Harshit for control in the middle overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>. Harshit Rana fits the template of a "hit-the-wicket" bowler, strong and capable of bowling at 145-150 km/h into the surface, which is a desirable method when opposing teams are good at playing spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.

Despite these tactical considerations, there isn't extensive ODI or List A cricket data for either Arshdeep Singh or Harshit Rana to fully analyze their roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. India's preference for two seamers means they lose certain options but gain flexibility in other areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:11">[00:33:11]</a>.

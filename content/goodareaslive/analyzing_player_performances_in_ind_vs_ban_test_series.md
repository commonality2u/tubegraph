The Test match between India and Bangladesh was described as "a lot more exciting than any of us thought it would be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:47">[01:16:47]</a>. This article analyzes key player performances from both teams throughout the series, highlighting statistical insights and strategic approaches.

## Bangladesh Batting Performance

### First Innings
Bangladesh's top four batsmen struggled to make significant runs consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:43">[02:29:43]</a>. However, Momimul Haque stood out with a brilliant century, scoring 100 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:27">[03:00:27]</a>. Despite his century, his control percentage was relatively low at 75% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:42">[03:22:42]</a>. Litton Das, another top-order batsman, showed a higher control percentage, around 80-85% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:39">[03:51:39]</a>. Despite Haque's efforts, Bangladesh's top order didn't receive enough support from other batsmen, preventing them from putting pressure on India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:27">[02:44:27]</a>.

## India Bowling Performance

### First Innings
India's bowlers displayed a strong collective performance, with a good spread of wickets among a five-man attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:38">[04:10:38]</a>.

*   **Jasprit Bumrah**: Took three wickets and was economical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:14">[03:58:14]</a>. His false shot percentage was remarkably high at 33% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:05">[04:29:05]</a>. Bumrah demonstrated exceptional accuracy, consistently hitting his desired spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:24">[09:18:24]</a> and constantly changing his speed based on the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:04">[07:55:04]</a>. While effective with the new ball, his primary strength lies in his old ball skills, leading to suggestions he could be a first-change bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:50:56">[29:50:56]</a>.
*   **Mohammed Siraj**: Was a bit more expensive but maintained a good line with his bowling, often bowling a little fuller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:19">[04:04:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:22">[09:40:22]</a>. His speed consistency was noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>.
*   **Akash Deep**: Had a false shot percentage over 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:52">[04:34:52]</a>. He impressed with his ability to maintain accuracy for extended periods, acting as a potential counterbalance to Siraj <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:08">[08:02:08]</a>. Akash Deep's speed analysis showed a normal pace ball with an extra "kick when he needs to" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:31">[07:47:31]</a>.
*   **Ravindra Jadeja**: Displayed a "phenomenal" and "brilliant" effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:30">[05:13:30]</a>. He is considered a "brilliant brilliant cricketer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:39">[05:15:39]</a>. Historically, Jadeja's batting average has significantly improved from 21.5 (2012-2015) to 42 (last couple of years), while his bowling has remained steady <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:50">[06:51:50]</a>. He is also noted as being significantly faster than other spinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:02:50">[26:02:50]</a>. Comparing him to other notable all-rounders like [[Imran Khan]], Sir Garfield Sobers, Jacques Kallis, and Ben Stokes, it's observed that his ability to both take 300 wickets and make 3,000 runs is rare and valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:20">[06:36:20]</a>.
*   **Ravichandran Ashwin**: Now has 423 wickets in Asia, placing him among the highest wicket-takers in the continent, behind only Anil Kumble's 612 and Harbhajan Singh's 300+ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:25">[08:20:25]</a>. Ashwin and Jadeja's spin analysis showed they bowled quicker and turned the ball more than Bangladesh's spinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:55:09">[24:55:09]</a>.

## India Batting Performance

India's second innings showcased an aggressive, high-scoring approach, contributing to one of the highest runs per over for a team with a minimum of 250 runs in Test history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:44">[10:08:44]</a>. This style of play reflects a natural evolution of Test cricket, influenced by T20 and ODI formats, a shift away from valuing draws, and the impact of the World Test Championship points system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:40">[11:41:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>.

*   **Rohit Sharma**: Demonstrated a "selfless innings," allowing other batsmen to attack, akin to Brendon McCullum's captaincy philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:05:07">[19:05:07]</a>. His approach with the new ball enabled quick scoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:01:21">[23:01:21]</a>.
*   **Yashasvi Jaiswal**: Played with freedom, currently facing less pressure, though future challenges are anticipated when playing in conditions like Australia or England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:35:48">[19:35:48]</a>.
*   **KL Rahul**: Praised for his versatility and ability to play with freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:56:07">[19:56:07]</a>. He can "gear up and gear down" his pace of scoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:37:05">[20:37:05]</a>.
*   **Ravindra Jadeja**: Scored 70 runs at better than a run-a-ball with a very high control percentage of 92%, indicating controlled and clever batting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:41:07">[20:41:07]</a>.
*   **Virat Kohli**: Scored 47 runs off 35 balls with a control percentage of 71% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:16:32">[21:16:32]</a>. This was described as a "selfless innings," prioritizing the team's objective of winning games and reaching the World Test Championship final <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:06:40">[22:06:40]</a>.
*   **Rishabh Pant**: Attacked 90% of the time but struggled to convert that into quick runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:25:35">[22:25:35]</a>.

## Bangladesh Bowling Performance

Bangladesh's bowlers struggled to contain India's aggressive batting, akin to how other teams initially reacted to "Bazball" tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:03">[16:16:03]</a>.

*   **Mehidy Hasan**: Showed improvement in finding the right speed to bowl on Indian wickets and consciously mixed up his speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:20:00">[23:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:05:37">[27:05:37]</a>.
*   **Taijul Islam**: Although not "killing it," he maintained a respectable position compared to other bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:39:10">[23:39:10]</a>. He tends to operate at two key speeds: slightly slower and more floated, and slightly quicker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:52:00">[26:52:00]</a>.
*   **Shakib Al Hasan**: Appeared more comfortable bowling in this game compared to the previous one and had improved his bowling speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:23:07">[24:23:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:13:30">[26:13:30]</a>.
*   **Khaled Ahmed**: Was described as "a little bit unlucky" with a high false shot percentage, but his inability to take wickets while conceding many runs negated this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:06:00">[24:06:00]</a>.

Generally, Bangladesh's spinners produced less turn and bowled at slower speeds compared to their Indian counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:14:00">[25:14:00]</a>.

**Note on Control Percentage**: Control percentage is a metric that indicates how often a batter hits the ball where they intended to, or makes a controlled shot. A low percentage may suggest the batter was not in control, perhaps playing and missing, or hitting the ball in an unintended direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:40:02">[32:40:02]</a>. While a high control percentage is often desirable, some players, like Dean Elgar or Rory Burns, can still make runs with lower percentages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:07:05">[33:07:05]</a>. It's often used to assess the difficulty of the pitch or the quality of a knock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:32:00">[33:32:00]</a>.

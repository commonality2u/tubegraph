New Zealand comprehensively defeated South Africa by 50 runs in Lahore to secure their spot in the Champions Trophy final against [[preview_of_new_zealand_vs_india_final | India]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>. While some online commentators dismissed the result as a "joke", New Zealand's dominant performance showed they were fully deserving of the win, having outplayed South Africa in almost every aspect of the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:02">[01:31:02]</a>. South Africa had entered the match as slight favourites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:08">[01:43:08]</a>.

## Toss and Pitch Conditions
New Zealand captain Mitchell Santner won the toss and elected to bat first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:03">[02:17:03]</a>, a decision South African captain Temba Bavuma also would have made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:06">[02:24:06]</a>. The pitch was described as a "belter of a surface" and "basically a road" for batting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:09">[02:27:09]</a>. While conducive to high scores, the conditions did change slightly in the second innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:02">[03:12:02]</a>. New Zealand posted 362, considered an above-par total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:02">[03:36:02]</a>, although some believed par was higher at 380 and that New Zealand left runs on the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:03">[03:17:03]</a>.

## South Africa's Chase Falters
South Africa's chase never gained significant momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:02">[01:54:02]</a>. While Rassie van der Dussen and Temba Bavuma built a partnership, they were only at parity, never truly on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:05">[02:07:05]</a>.

### Top Order Struggles
South Africa's main issue was their top order's inability to capitalize on the batting conditions, particularly Temba Bavuma's slow scoring rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:01">[04:01:01]</a>. He was stuck at 3 runs off 18 balls and ended his innings 15 runs behind run-a-ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:04">[04:33:04]</a>. The focus on containing New Zealand's new ball bowlers, particularly Matt Henry, led to Bavuma forgetting the need to score runs, resulting in a crucial slowdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:07">[04:09:07]</a>.

The early wicket of Ryan Rickelton, who appeared set for a big score, was also significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:04">[05:22:04]</a>. His dismissal stemmed from a delivery that "stopped on him," pushing it straight to short cover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:05">[05:29:05]</a>.

### Mid-Innings Collapse
Despite a good period where Bavuma and van der Dussen played well, South Africa fell behind due to two overs by Michael Bracewell and Mitchell Santner that went for only two runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:02">[06:31:02]</a>. A batch of wickets fell in the middle overs, making it impossible for them to catch up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:02">[05:57:02]</a>.

### David Miller's Unbeaten Century
David Miller played an outstanding innings, scoring an unbeaten 100 off 67 deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:04">[02:52:04]</a>, a knock that summed up his career of performing in knockouts but often being left stranded due to lack of support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:04">[09:28:04]</a>. He was out of partners at the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:08">[09:57:08]</a>, and his efforts, despite the game being "toast," showed what he could have achieved with support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:44:06">[20:44:06]</a>. He was not giving up, but rather trying to keep other batsmen in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:02:03">[20:02:03]</a>.

### Fielding and Bowling
South Africa's bowling performance was considered one of their worst in recent times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:45">[53:45]</a>. Even their best bowler, Lungi Ngidi (3 for 72), took wickets with slower deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:26">[44:26]</a>. Kagiso Rabada, typically a threat with the new ball, was used at first change and didn't look as threatening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:19">[53:19]</a>. Marco Jansen had a terrible day, conceding 79 runs without a wicket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:25">[53:25]</a>.

Their fielding, usually a strength, also faltered, dropping two catches including key opportunities for Kane Williamson and Daryl Mitchell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:20">[54:20]</a>.

## New Zealand's Masterclass
New Zealand's batting order executed their plan perfectly, overcoming the South African challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:13">[49:13]</a>.

### Rachin Ravindra's Brilliance
Player of the Match Rachin Ravindra scored his second century of the Champions Trophy, an impressive 108 off 101 deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:01">[39:01]</a>. He also snuck in a wicket, taking one for 20 from five overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:09">[39:09]</a>. Ravindra set a new record as the fastest to five ODI centuries in ICC 50-over events, reaching the milestone in just 13 innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:17">[39:17]</a>. His impeccable range, strong play against both pace and spin, and ability to stay ahead of the game with a better than run-a-ball strike rate were crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:29">[39:29]</a>.

### Kane Williamson's Catch-up Knock
Kane Williamson scored 102 off 94 balls, a catch-up knock after a relatively slow start (40 off 57 deliveries) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:07">[40:07]</a>. His intent shots, including reverse sweeps and scoops, showcased his adaptation to the team's needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:13">[42:13]</a>. While he sometimes struggles with power, this innings showed a rare ballistic side of his game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:01">[45:01]</a>. Williamson's ability to explode in the later stages, coupled with Ravindra's quick scoring, allowed him to find his rhythm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:27">[49:27]</a>. He was dropped on 56 by Heinrich Klaasen, a moment that could have significantly impacted the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:36">[43:36]</a>.

### Supporting Contributions
Daryl Mitchell scored 49 off 37 balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:50">[47:50]</a>, finding form after a shaky start because Williamson was going well at the other end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:38">[49:38]</a>. Glenn Phillips scored an unbeaten 49 off 27 deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:53">[47:53]</a>, smashing boundaries against Jansen and Rabada in the death overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:56">[50:56]</a>. New Zealand's decision to promote Tom Latham ahead of Phillips baffled some analysts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:48">[48:48]</a>, but overall, their batting order worked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:13">[49:13]</a>.

### Mitchell Santner's Impact
Mitchell Santner delivered the best bowling spell of the day, taking 3 for 43 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:02">[06:46:02]</a>. He removed well-set batsmen Temba Bavuma and Rassie van der Dussen, along with Heinrich Klaasen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:03">[06:49:03]</a>. His delivery to dismiss van der Dussen was considered the best of the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:04">[06:55:04]</a>. Santner's recent form, marked by pace variations, accuracy, and length, has seen him surpass Keshav Maharaj as a limited-overs spinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:02">[09:09:02]</a>. He has transformed into a dangerous bowler, surprising many with his wicket-taking ability despite being traditionally a defensive bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:07">[08:47:07]</a>.

## Outlook for the Final
New Zealand's performance, particularly their ability to score high totals, addresses a previous concern about their capability in high-scoring games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:50">[50:50]</a>. They demonstrated excellent fielding, with a 96% catch success rate in the tournament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:25">[54:25]</a>.

Despite this win, [[new_zealands_performance_and_bowling_strategy | New Zealand]] are still considered underdogs against [[india_vs_new_zealand_odi_match_evaluation | India]] in the final <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:42">[54:42]</a>. While India are massive favorites, they are not a perfect side, and New Zealand has the advantage of having played in Dubai previously in the tournament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:18">[55:18]</a>. The fitness of Matt Henry, who took 5 for 42 against India in the group stage, will be crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:11">[56:11]</a>. New Zealand will need to take early wickets to make the game competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:32">[56:32]</a>. The toss in Dubai could also play a significant role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:20">[01:09:20]</a>.

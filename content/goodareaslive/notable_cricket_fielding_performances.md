The Crick Picks podcast, in its eleventh episode, conducted a snake-style draft to determine the top five fielders in [[best_fielders_in_cricket_history | cricket history]] from each of the three hosts' perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. The discussion highlighted various attributes that define excellence in [[Significance of fielding and catch efficiency in cricket | fielding]], including athleticism, catching ability, throwing arm accuracy, and versatility across positions.

## Top Fielder Selections

### Faf du Plessis
Considered by one host as potentially the best fielder of all time, Faf du Plessis was noted for his exceptional abilities as a slips fielder, as well as being a top-five outfielder during his younger, fitter years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. His unique combination of skills in both areas sets him apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. He even once brought [[ab_de_villiers | AB de Villiers]] to play a club cricket game in England, with du Plessis fielding at point and de Villiers at cover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>.

### Ravindra Jadeja
In [[Recent performances of Asian cricket players | contemporary cricket]], Ravindra Jadeja is widely regarded as one of the best fielders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. His key strengths include a "bullet arm," superb outfielding, and reliability as a catcher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>. He is known for securing many run-outs and famously took a catch in a test match in New Zealand that was described as "that [[ben_stokes | Ben Stokes]] catch from the World Cup versus South Africa, but kind of better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. While an excellent fielder, his relative standing against past generations is debated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

### Ricky Ponting
Ricky Ponting was praised for his prowess in the slips and infield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. His ability to consistently achieve direct hits on the stumps was highlighted as particularly exceptional, making him one of the best in that regard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.

### Jonty Rhodes
A "revolutionary fielder," Jonty Rhodes is credited with changing perceptions of [[Impact of fielding on cricket matches | fielding]] and inspiring a new level of athleticism in the sport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>. While his ground coverage and athleticism were superb, some debate exists regarding his stump-hitting accuracy compared to others, as his most famous run-out involved not throwing the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>. His hand skills were also considered by some to be slightly below those of top catchers like Jadeja or Ponting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>.

### AB de Villiers
[[ab_de_villiers | AB de Villiers]] was an all-round brilliant fielder, known for his ability to force a dismissal in nearly every game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>. He was a skilled catcher and outfielder, and also kept wicket on occasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>. His general athleticism was so profound that he was considered capable of playing multiple sports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>.

### Garfield Sobers
Stories about Garfield Sobers suggest he was a "revolutionary fielder" capable of fielding in every single position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>. He was known for taking rare catches while running back with the flight of the ball, similar to those seen by [[ben_stokes | Ben Stokes]] and Steve Waugh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>.

### Colin Bland
Colin Bland was described as a "Jonty 40 years before Jonty," due to his incredible athleticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a>. He was so renowned for his fielding that people would attend matches specifically to watch his fielding practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:00">[12:35:00]</a>. Known for hitting the stumps consistently, he was a proper player who averaged 49 in Test cricket, but his batting was often overshadowed by his exceptional fielding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>.

### Paul Collingwood
Paul Collingwood was an "immense catcher" and a very quick outfielder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:32:00">[14:32:00]</a>. He took "some absolute blinders" at point, including a famous catch that is suggested to be looked up on YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:34:00">[14:34:00]</a>. His [[Impact of fielding on cricket matches | fielding]] was considered his best asset among his all-rounder skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a>.

### Kieron Pollard
Kieron Pollard is arguably one of the greatest boundary fielders ever, making difficult boundary catches look simple with his large hands and athleticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:40:00">[16:40:00]</a>. He is particularly noted for his "Parry catch" technique, sending the ball back over the boundary before catching it again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:19:00">[18:19:00]</a>. While perhaps more specialized, his potential to be a great slip fielder in longer formats is recognized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:14:00">[19:14:00]</a>.

### Andrew Symonds
Andrew Symonds possessed incredible athleticism and was deceptively quick for his size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:03:00">[20:03:00]</a>. He was known for hitting the stumps frequently, had a superb arm, and excelled in all [[Significance of fielding and catch efficiency in cricket | fielding]] positions (infield, outfield, catching, direct hits) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:05:00">[20:05:00]</a>. Symonds, like [[jonty_rhodes | Jonty Rhodes]] and Colin Bland, was a player who thought about [[impact_of_fielding_on_cricket_matches | fielding]] differently, treating it as importantly as batting and bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:21:00">[21:21:00]</a>. He is also considered one of the best fielders of his own bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:41:00">[22:41:00]</a>.

### Ben Stokes
[[ben_stokes | Ben Stokes]] is an alert and athletic fielder known for taking "splendid catches" in the slips and gully, including amazing one-handed grabs while running back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:28:00">[23:28:00]</a>. He frequently hits the stumps and makes crucial run-outs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:47:00">[23:47:00]</a>. While he might "clang" a little more as a slip fielder, his athleticism allows him to get to many catches others wouldn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:17:00">[24:17:00]</a>.

### Mark Waugh
Mark Waugh was lauded as perhaps the "most skillful fielder in every position" ever seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:23:00">[28:23:00]</a>. He could field at short leg, silly point, slip, point, and boundary, possessing an almost unparalleled "first touch" with his hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:53:00">[26:53:00]</a>. His tactical awareness meant he was always in the right spot, evidenced by his interception in the 1999 World Cup semi-final and a great catch in the final <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:11:00">[27:11:00]</a>. He is also considered a favorite second slip fielder of all time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:40:00">[27:40:00]</a>.

### Jim Laker
Despite poor batting statistics (averaging 15 in Test cricket), Jim Laker's long career was attributed to his exceptional [[Significance of fielding and catch efficiency in cricket | fielding]] abilities, leading to him being considered close to the best fielder in the world for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:33:00">[29:33:00]</a>. There are stories of him regularly winning games with his [[cricket_and_player_performances | fielding]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:43:00">[29:43:00]</a>.

### Shadab Khan
A self-admittedly biased pick, Shadab Khan was hailed as the best Pakistani fielder ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:50:00">[32:50:00]</a>. He is described as a "terrific" point fielder, equally good at catching and stopping quick shots, and accumulating a fair number of direct hits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:53:00">[32:53:00]</a>. His [[cricket_and_player_performances | fielding]] is currently considered his best attribute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:49:00">[34:49:00]</a>.

### Steve Smith
Steve Smith is recognized as a really good catcher who applies extra pressure as a fielder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:49:00">[35:49:00]</a>. He is consistently good, particularly in the last five to six years, taking "phenomenal" catches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:27:00">[36:27:00]</a>. His younger self was described as an "incredible" fielder, a combination of Ponting and Mark Waugh in his ability to read the game and be in the right place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:15:00">[37:15:00]</a>.

## Debate on Fielding Attributes
The hosts debated the relative importance of different [[Significance of fielding and catch efficiency in cricket | fielding]] attributes, such as pure athleticism versus clean hands and accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>.

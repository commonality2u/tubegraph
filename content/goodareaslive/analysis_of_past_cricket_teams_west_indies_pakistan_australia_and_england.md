The Footmarks podcast, in its 70th episode titled "Time Travelers," discussed which historical cricket teams could potentially win a Test series against the current formidable Indian team at home. India has won 18 consecutive Test series at home, making winning a Test match, or even a series, in India "probably the toughest task in the sport" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:59">[00:59:59]</a>. This analysis considers various historical teams and their strengths against modern India's lineup, which includes experienced batters like Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, generational talents Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill, the phenomenal Rishabh Pant, and one of the best spin bowling partnerships of all time in Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. Jasprit Bumrah is considered the best all-format cricketer in contemporary cricket, with Mohammed Siraj and the currently injured Mohammed Shami also part of the strong bowling attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. This Indian unit, spanning several years, is described as "invincible on home soil" with "no holes in the team" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.

## Criteria for Evaluating "Time Traveler" Teams

Jared Kimber established five key criteria to measure the potential of historical teams against modern India:
*   **Fast Spinners:** Spinners who bowl with pace, as slow spinners struggle in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.
*   **Flat Pitch Quicks:** Fast bowlers capable of performing on flat pitches, delivering reverse swing or deadly accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.
*   **Batting Depth:** A strong batting lineup where numbers six and seven are not weak links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.
*   **All-rounders:** Necessary to have five bowlers, as India employs five <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.
*   **Few Left-Handers:** A batting lineup with minimal left-handed batters to mitigate Ravichandran Ashwin's effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

## Teams That Have Defeated India in the Millennium

Since 2000, only three teams have managed to win a Test series in India. However, their prospects against the current Indian juggernaut are questioned:

### South Africa (2000)
This team had good batting, but their bowling attack, led by Shaun Pollock (9 wickets), Hansie Cronje (6 wickets), and main spinner Nicky Boje (7 wickets), would likely struggle against modern India. Hansie Cronje's bowling would be ineffective, and Nicky Boje's average of 42-43 would not suffice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.

### Australia (2004)
This Australian side was "absolutely stacked with both bat and ball" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. Despite Shane Warne's improved performance (14 wickets) on that tour, they had too many left-handers and lacked a strong second spinner (Nathan Hauritz was not ideal). Glenn McGrath and Jason Gillespie were at their peak, but the team might still fall short due to spin support and left-handers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

### England (2012)
This series was won thanks to the spin duo of Graeme Swann and Monty Panesar, coupled with tons from Alastair Cook and Kevin Pietersen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. However, this team lacked a genuine all-rounder. While Swann and Panesar were excellent, they are not considered better than Ashwin and Jadeja at their peak, and England lacked a third quality spinner or seamer for Indian conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. Alastair Cook's exceptional record against Ashwin in India (averaging 46 over 761 balls faced) is noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

## Teams Unlikely to Succeed

### Sri Lanka
Despite having "magnificent players" like Muttiah Muralitharan and Rangana Herath who even played together, their records in India were not strong. Muralitharan was often too slow for Indian pitches and batters, and Herath also struggled to take wickets in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. While they had strong batters like Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene, their bowling lineup, beyond Muralitharan, wasn't sufficiently strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

### New Zealand
New Zealand has historically "never had a great spinner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. Daniel Vettori, their best spinner, was often valued for his batting. They lacked a complementary spin partner, and even though Ajaz Patel took 10 wickets in a match, his second spinner was Will Somerville, highlighting the lack of depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. Even strong 1980s teams with all-rounders like Richard Hadlee lacked a strong second spinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.

## Historical Teams Analysis

### Australia
Australia has several strong historical teams that could be considered:

*   **Australia (2001):** This team, known for the famous [[analysis_of_historical_cricket_matches_and_records | Laxman and Dravid series]] comeback, included Shane Warne, who wasn't at his best in India at this point. However, the underused Colin Miller, a fast off-spinner who could generate significant pace and jag, is seen as a key addition. Miller was the Test Player of the Year when greats like McGrath, Warne, and Ponting were playing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. His unique bowling action and speed could trouble Indian batters. This team, with "Peak Gilchrist" who could counter Ashwin, along with faster McGrath and Gillespie, is considered a better shot than the 2004 team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

*   **Australia (1969-70):** The last Australian team to win a Test series in India before 2004. It featured spin bowlers Ashley Mallett and John Gleeson, a "mystery spinner" of his day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. Gleeson's average of 31.2 in India and the team's lack of a great fast bowler like Jasprit Bumrah make it seem unlikely to succeed against current India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.

*   **Australia (1950-51):** This team included Jack Iverson, the pioneer of the carrom ball, who was a legitimate mystery spinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. The batting was stacked even post-Bradman, featuring all-rounder Keith Miller (one of only three Test cricketers to average over 35 with the bat and under 25 with the ball, alongside Imran Khan and Ravindra Jadeja), and frontline seamer Ray Lindwall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. Neil Harvey, a left-hander, had one of the best records against off-spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. The combination of a mystery spinner, strong batting depth, and quality fast bowling makes it a strong contender.

*   **Australia (1932-36):** The "Bradman years" team presents a fascinating match-up. Though Donald Bradman never played in Asia, he faced quality spinners on turning wickets globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. The team boasted an "incredible four spinners" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>: leg-spinner Clarrie Grimmett (fastest to 200 Test wickets for almost a century), Bill O'Reilly (considered by many the best bowler in the world at the time), Chuck Fleetwood-Smith (left-arm wrist spinner), and Bert Ironmonger (slow left-arm). All four offered different bowling types, providing immense variety. Strong batting depth with Bradman, the two Bills (Ponsford and Brown), and Stan McCabe, makes this a formidable side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. Its only potential weakness is the lack of an elite fast bowler and all-rounder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

### Pakistan
Historical Pakistan teams offer intriguing possibilities:

*   **Pakistan (1987):** This team defeated India in India and also won in England. Imran Khan's leadership and all-round prowess, alongside Wasim Akram's reverse swing, were key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>. Although Abdul Qadir was part of the squad, the Bangalore Test win was secured by spinners Tauseef Ahmed and Iqbal Qasim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. Javed Miandad, a "great player of spin," added strength to the batting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>. While solid, their spin bowling might not be fully equipped to handle modern India's batters compared to Ashwin and Jadeja <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.

*   **Pakistan (1999):** This team is considered "the strongest Pakistan team on paper" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. It featured a strong spin attack with Saqlain Mushtaq, Mushtaq Ahmed, and Shahid Afridi. The fast bowling trio of Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis, and Shoaib Akhtar, though not always playing in tandem, were formidable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. All-rounders Azhar Mahmood and Abdul Razzaq, coupled with batters Saeed Anwar, Inzamam-ul-Haq, and Mohammad Yousuf, provided immense depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. The only slight concern was Mushtaq Ahmed's lack of wickets in Asia, making Afridi the second spinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>.

*   **Pakistan (Mid-2010s):** This team, which briefly topped the world rankings, featured Misbah-ul-Haq and Younis Khan as batting mainstays, supported by Asad Shafiq and Azhar Ali <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>. Sarfaraz Ahmed was a decent wicket-keeper. The key strength was their spin, with Yasir Shah in his record-breaking period and Saeed Ajmal who was "unplayable on any surface" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. However, the careers of Yasir Shah and Saeed Ajmal did not significantly overlap, meaning a time machine could only bring one of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>. If both could play together, coupled with a strong fast bowling group (Junaid Khan, Wahab Riaz, Mohammad Amir, Rahat Ali), they would have a strong chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.

### West Indies
The dominant West Indies era is often mentioned, but their relevance to Indian conditions is debated:

*   **West Indies (1983-84):** This team had some of the "best fast bowlers of any era," but they "didn't have any spinners," making them unsuitable for Indian conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. Malcolm Marshall and others, despite their quality, would not take wickets at a better average than Ashwin or Jadeja on Indian pitches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>.

*   **West Indies (1966-67):** This team had Lance Gibbs, but he lacked sufficient support in the spin department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.

*   **West Indies (1960):** This team is deemed "stacked" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. It featured Lance Gibbs, all-rounder Garry Sobers (who could bowl slow left-arm orthodox, seam, or wrist spin), Sonny Ramadhin, and Alf Valentine in the spin department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>. The pace bowling included Wes Hall and Roy Gilchrist. The batting was exceptionally deep with the "three W's" (Worrell, Weekes, Walcott), Rohan Kanhai, and Conrad Hunte <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>. Sobers' versatility and Gibbs' phenomenal record in Asia (54 wickets in 14 games at an average of 14, mostly in India) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>, make this team a strong contender despite a lack of "fast-paced" spinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.

### England
Beyond the 2012 team, other historical England sides are considered:

*   **England (1908-1914):** This team featured Sydney Barnes (who, like Bumrah, was a bowler with a "gray area" between seam and spin and boasted the best bowling average of all time for over 150 wickets), Jack Hobbs (one of the best openers of all time, operating at a "Bradman level" pre-war), and all-rounder Wilfred Rhodes (who bowled spin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>. While the top three players are perfect for India, the rest of the team was "haphazard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>, and Rhodes's slow pace would be a concern.

*   **England (1952-1957):** This is considered a "ridiculously stacked team" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>. It included Jim Laker (the only player to take 19 wickets in a Test match, and a fast off-spinner who never bowled in India but could have "run riot"), Tony Lock, and Fred Titmus as other spinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>. Johnny Wardle was a left-arm finger spinner who could also bowl wrist spin, offering multiple options. Fast bowlers included Fred Trueman (skillful, bowls all day, ideal for India) and the express-paced Frank "Typhoon" Tyson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>. The batting lineup was strong with Len Hutton, Ken Barrington (both top 10 batters of all time), Peter May, and Colin Cowdrey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>. Dennis Compton, a frontline batter, also bowled left-arm wrist spin, adding a valuable secondary skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>. All-rounder Trevor Bailey further bolstered the side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>. This team is noted for players who scored runs on "uncovered wickets" in England, where fast finger spinners dominated, making them well-suited for Indian conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>.

## The Elon Musk Challenge: Winning Two Series in India

In a hypothetical scenario where Elon Musk challenges the hosts to pick three historical teams to win a Test series in present-day India, with the condition of winning at least two to survive:

> [01:12:30] "Jared, you can bring three teams to present day India for test series but two of those teams need to win the test series for you to make a profit and if you don't make a profit he'll kill you."

### Jared's Picks
Jared's automatic picks are:
*   England (1952-57)
*   West Indies (1960)

For the third pick, Jared takes a "flyer":
*   Pakistan (1999): Chosen over Australia (1932-36) due to "more bowling options" and a harder team to "game plan against" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:23">[01:13:23]</a>.

### Baram's Picks
Baram's top teams were also Pakistan (1999) and West Indies (1960). For the third spot, he debated between England (1952-57) and Australia (1932-36). To be "a bit different" and driven by the desire to "sell those tickets" to see Bradman, Baram picks:
*   Australia (1932-36)

### The Ultimate Pick
When pressed to pick only one team for his life, Jared eventually leans towards:
*   West Indies (1960): Despite ranking England (1952-57) slightly higher initially, the "slightly better all-rounder" in Sobers and similar batting, with Gibbs's proven record in Asia, sways his decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:08">[01:16:08]</a>.

## Conclusion: India's Unbroken Dominance

Despite the deep dive into cricket history, a consensus emerges that no current team is truly set up to beat India in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. Australia is considered the most likely candidate if their current talent, like Todd Murphy and Nathan Lyon, reaches its full potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. However, the ultimate question of when India's streak will break might simply depend on the inevitable "transition period" when key players like Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja retire or their form declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. Until then, the current Indian team remains the "most dominant side in Test Cricket in this era particularly at home" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.

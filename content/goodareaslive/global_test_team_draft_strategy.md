The Crick Picks podcast, in its 38th episode, engages in a unique and challenging cricket draft titled "current global Test 11" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. The podcast typically involves participants drafting their top five players for a generic cricket category in a snake-style competition (pick order 1-2-3-3-2-1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:40]</a>. Occasionally, they combine picks to create a team, as was done in this episode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

## Global Test Team Draft Rules & Challenges
The primary rule for this draft was that no more than one player could be selected from a single nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. This constraint made the draft "nerve-wracking" and "very very hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

Key challenges highlighted by the hosts included:
*   **Limited Player Options** Some nations, like Zimbabwe and Ireland, have played very few Test matches (e.g., Zimbabwe played three Tests in three years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. This drastically reduces the pool of "current" Test players to choose from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.
*   **Difficulty in Player Qualification** It was uncertain if players like Sikandar Raza qualified as current Test players due to infrequent matches or potential unofficial retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. Blessing Muzarabani, an early pick, had played only one Test in the last three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.
*   **Balancing Talent and Availability** Participants noted that it was "horrendously hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a> to create an "incredible Test team" under these rules, predicting a "Frankenstein's monster" of a side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.

## Draft Strategy
Two main strategies emerged during the draft:
1.  **Prioritizing Players from Weaker Nations:** Jared Kimber advocated for picking "good players from bad teams first" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>. This strategy aims to secure a viable player from a nation with limited options, preventing being left with no suitable choice later in the draft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. This was evident in his first pick, Blessing Muzarabani from Zimbabwe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.
2.  **Picking Obvious Elite Players Early:** Baram Kazi initially believed in "just pick the best players" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>. This led him to select high-profile players like Joe Root and Kane Williamson early, which later constrained his choices from other nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:31:00">[16:31:00]</a>.

Other strategic considerations included:
*   **Batting vs. Bowling Balance:** Jared suggested prioritizing batters from nations with multiple strong bowling options (e.g., India) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>.
*   **Openers Scarcity:** It was noted that Test openers are difficult to come by <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>, making Dimuth Karunaratne an "obvious choice" from Sri Lanka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>.
*   **Wicketkeeper Timing:** The decision of when to pick a wicketkeeper was a point of discussion. Delaying the pick might allow for securing a key bowler or batter, hoping a decent keeper remains available from a less-contested nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>.

## Team Selections
The final team, aiming for a "current global Test 11" with one player per nation, was constructed as follows:

| Mehidy Hasan Miraz   | Bangladesh    | Pick 7 (Jared)         | Spinner/all-rounder, only confident pick from Bangladesh early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>. |
| Kagiso Rabada        | South Africa  | Pick 8 (Baram)         | Seamer, 291 Test wickets, best strike rate ever (for 20+ Tests) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00">[12:06:00]</a>. |
| Jason Holder         | West Indies   | Pick 9 (Estelle)       | Bowling all-rounder, easy to fit in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:00]</a>.                                  |
| Lorcan Tucker        | Ireland       | Pick 10 (Estelle)      | Wicketkeeper, "very very difficult to pick a player from Ireland" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52:00">[15:52:00]</a>, obvious choice for keeper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09:00">[16:09:00]</a>. |
| Mohammad Rizwan      | Pakistan      | Pick 11 (Baram)        | Wicketkeeper, flattering record, averages 40.4 in 30 Tests, away average higher than home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:22:00">[17:22:00]</a>. |
| Rashid Khan (12th Man) | Afghanistan   | Pick 12 (Baram)        | Spinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:05:00">[19:05:00]</a>, despite not playing many recent Tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:10:00">[19:10:00]</a>. |

The team was considered to have a strong top four and a "pretty good attack" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:31:00">[22:31:00]</a>, but some weakness in the middle order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:23:00">[22:23:00]</a>. The team offers multiple bowling combinations, including spin options with Mehidy Hasan and Rashid Khan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:49:00">[22:49:00]</a>.

## Future Draft Considerations
The difficulty of this draft led to suggestions for future improvements:
*   **Zoning Players:** Introducing "zones" for players could help balance picks across different player types and strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:36:00">[20:36:00]</a>.
*   **[[Evolution of Test Cricket strategies | All-Time Global Test 11]]:** Applying similar rules for an all-time team draft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:41:00">[20:41:00]</a>.
*   **[[Challenges in Selecting Current Test Players from Different Nations | Impact of Limited Test Matches on Player Selection]]:** The draft highlighted how limited Test schedules for some nations complicate player selection and assessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:33:00">[23:33:00]</a>.

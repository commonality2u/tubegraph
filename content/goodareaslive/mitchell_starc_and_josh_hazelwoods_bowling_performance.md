The recent match saw an unusually high number of wickets, a "wicket blowout" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, with the day's play being described as "ridiculous how many wickets we actually saw there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This was largely influenced by significant seam movement, averaging around 0.9 degrees for a long period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, making batting extremely difficult regardless of technique or form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

## Mitchell Starc's Resurgence

Mitchell Starc delivered one of his best performances in quite a while <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. He looked like a "completely different bowler than we've seen in Test Cricket for a while" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, showcasing "a lot of extra Rhythm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a> and consistently hitting the right length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

Previously, Starc had struggled in Test bowling since 2020, a period which coincided with Kookaburra changing the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. His struggles were attributed to attempting the wobble ball and losing his swing and early wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. In this match, he bowled a mix of swing, wobble ball, and traditional seam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

Historically, Starc has shown varied performance across different venues in the first 10 overs of games in Australia:
*   **Adelaide (Pink Ball):** "basically unplayable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
*   **Gabba, Sydney, Melbourne:** "fine if not Elite" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
*   **WACA:** "never did anything with a new ball" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
*   **Optus Stadium (Perth):** He is a "different bowler here than he is like anywhere else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>, which was evident in this match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

Leading into the series, Starc was considered the "weakest link of the bowlers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>, but his performance today did not reflect that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

## Josh Hazelwood's Consistent Excellence

Josh Hazelwood's performance has been "awesome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. He has been on a "tear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>, particularly in the last 12-14 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. His form this year has been "ridiculous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>, with his average hovering around 11 or 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

Once considered an "average bowler for a while" after prioritizing white-ball cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>, Hazelwood is "no longer an average bowler" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. He is currently averaging 13.69 with the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. He was predicted to be the "best bowler in this series" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a> due to his ability to pick up so many wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

## Overall Bowling Conditions

The Perth wicket's behavior today was unusual. While typically it gets "easier to bat on day one than any other day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, with a normal average of 64.8 runs per wicket on day one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>, today saw wickets falling at an average of 12.76 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. The curator attempted to make it a better batting pitch by adding more moisture and keeping it greener, expecting it to flatten out on subsequent days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>.

The difficulty for batters isn't just about the pitches; it's also attributed to changes in the Kookaburra ball since 2020. Kookaburra has added "extra lacker on the ball" and "reinforced that seam" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[00:24:36]</a>, leading to the writing on the ball remaining visible after 25 overs, which was not typical historically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>. This has resulted in balls being "juiced" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>, making it tougher for batters globally, particularly in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.

This era is considered the toughest for batting since the 1910s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>. The combination of faster bowlers, balls with more consistent seam movement, and the strategic use of techniques like the wobble ball makes it extremely challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>. The wobble ball, in particular, helps bowlers maintain seam exaggeration for longer periods by not flattening the seam as quickly as conventional seam bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:07">[00:50:07]</a>.

Despite the challenging conditions, some Indian batters like Rishabh Pant attempted to play in a non-traditional manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:45">[00:44:45]</a>, highlighting the need for adaptability in this bowling-dominant era. The [[Indias_bowling_strategies_and_performance | Indian team's bowling performance]] led by [[Indias_Bowling_Performance_in_the_Test | Jasprit Bumrah]] was also exceptional, with Bumrah consistently out-bowling brilliant opposition bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

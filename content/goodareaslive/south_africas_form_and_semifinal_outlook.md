South Africa has been identified as a well-rounded and strong team in the tournament, expected to top their group alongside India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:19">[00:43:19]</a>. They demonstrated their strength by "smashing the hell out of England," bowling them out for 179 and chasing the total down in 29.1 overs with seven wickets in hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>. This performance led to them topping Group B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:17">[00:43:17]</a>.

## Bowling Attack

South Africa boasts a "killer bowling attack" that is in form, with the exception of Lungi Ngidi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:17">[00:47:17]</a>.
*   **Marco Jansen:** Took 3 for 39 against England and has been effective with the new ball, also taking spectacular catches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:23">[00:44:23]</a>.
*   **Kagiso Rabada:** Picked up 3 for 36 against Afghanistan while bowling first change, which is considered unusual but effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:35">[00:44:35]</a>.
*   **Wiaan Mulder:** Despite a poor start against England, dropping a catch, he recovered to take 3 for 25, utilizing a "wobble seam nip backer" that troubles batters like Babar Azam and Joe Root <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:41">[00:44:41]</a>.
*   **Keshav Maharaj:** Consistently performs, picking up three wickets in the tournament, including 2 for 35 against England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:07">[00:45:07]</a>.

Concerns exist regarding Lungi Ngidi's current form, with observations that he "used to be good" but is "not good" now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:30">[00:42:30]</a>. The team might consider playing Corban Bosch if Ngidi continues to struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:37">[00:45:37]</a>. The team's overall bowling is considered solid for at least 40 overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:50">[00:46:50]</a>.

## Batting Lineup

The batting lineup is strong, with many players having scored runs:
*   **Ryan Rickelton:** Scored a century against Afghanistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:41">[00:48:41]</a>.
*   **Rassie van der Dussen:** Has back-to-back fifties, with 50 against Afghanistan and an unbeaten 72 against England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:46">[00:48:46]</a>. He takes his time initially but can be ballistic once set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:53">[00:48:53]</a>.
*   **Aiden Markram:** Scored a fifty against Afghanistan, though he is currently nursing a tight hamstring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>.
*   **Temba Bavuma:** Scored a fifty against Afghanistan and has been dealing with illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:06">[00:49:06]</a>.
*   **Heinrich Klaasen:** Considered a key player, he has returned from injury with a remarkable streak of five consecutive ODI fifties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:24">[00:49:24]</a>. He is known for "absolutely annihilating spin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:57">[00:49:57]</a> but also showed his power against England's seamers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.
*   **David Miller:** Good against spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:47">[00:51:47]</a>.

Injuries and illness to key players like Markram and Bavuma are a concern that could impact their tournament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:15">[00:49:15]</a>.

## Semifinal Outlook

South Africa will face [[New Zealand vs South Africa semifinal review | New Zealand]] in the semifinal in Lahore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:52">[00:41:52]</a>.
*   While [[New Zealand vs South Africa semifinal review | New Zealand]] is seen as a "bogey team" for South Africa, similar to India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:57">[00:52:57]</a>, South Africa is considered the better team pound-for-pound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>.
*   The Lahore pitch is expected to offer movement with the new ball, even under lights, and can be "sticky" at times, bringing spinners into play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>. This could pose a challenge if they are troubled by spin, though players like Klaasen and Miller are strong against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:42">[00:51:42]</a>.
*   New Zealand's discipline in bowling and fielding is an edge they hold over other teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>. However, South Africa's pace of scoring is generally quicker than New Zealand's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:44">[00:40:44]</a>.

South Africa is still widely considered the "second best team in this tournament" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:15">[00:48:15]</a>. The overall prediction for the final is that it will be between [[preview_of_new_zealand_vs_india_final | South Africa and India]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a>.

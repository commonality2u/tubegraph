The [[indian_cricket_team_performance_in_cwc_2023 | Indian cricket team]] entered the [[Cricket World Cup 2023 analysis | World Cup]] as a dominant force, widely considered the best team in ODI Cricket at the moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>. Despite their consistent performances leading up to and during the tournament, they faced several challenges and made tactical decisions that ultimately impacted their outcome in the final match against [[Australias cricket strategy and performance in ODI World Cup 2023 | Australia]].

## Pre-Tournament and Early Campaign
The team had not needed to solve many problems throughout the [[Cricket World Cup 2023 analysis | World Cup]], as their "Plan A" had worked effectively for most of the tournament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. This lack of necessity to adapt or employ alternative plans became a significant challenge in the final <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>. While [[Australias cricket strategy and performance in ODI World Cup 2023 | Australia]] had been challenged in various matches, learning much about themselves and having different options, India's consistent success meant they weren't tested in the same way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:58:00">[53:58:00]</a>.

## Batting Challenges in the Final
In the final, India's batting lineup faced multiple issues, including:
*   **Pitch Conditions**: The pitch played differently across the innings. While the new ball was particularly easy to hit, the older ball became harder to score runs from, similar to many IPL pitches where the "air goes out of balls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:14:00">[27:14:00]</a>. This made scoring and rotating strike difficult in the first innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:54:00">[25:54:00]</a>.
*   **Defensive Mindset**: After losing early wickets, the [[indian_cricket_team_performance_in_cwc_2023 | Indian batters]] shifted into a defensive mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:32:00">[14:32:00]</a>. This conservative approach, common in knockout games, led to a period of slow scoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:09:00">[31:09:00]</a>, including a long stretch without boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:21:00">[44:21:00]</a>. This allowed [[Australias cricket strategy and performance in ODI World Cup 2023 | Australia]] to bowl without significant pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:46:00">[59:46:00]</a>.
*   **The "Evan Gbus Effect"**: The lack of a strong number eight batter, such as Hardik Pandya, influenced the top-order's approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:43:00">[28:43:00]</a>. When the batting depth is perceived as shallow (e.g., a number eight with an average of seven), top-order batters like Virat Kohli tend to reduce their strike rate to ensure they don't get out and expose the tail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:38:00">[29:38:00]</a>. Kohli's strike rate dropped significantly in games without Hardik Pandya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:53:00">[29:53:00]</a>.
*   **Individual Batting Performances**:
    *   Rohit Sharma showed great intent at the start, despite the loss of Shubman Gill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:01:00">[42:01:00]</a>. His aggressive approach was suited to the new ball period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:22:00">[42:22:00]</a>.
    *   KL Rahul's innings, while providing stability, was criticized for being too slow, with a strike rate of 61 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:40:00">[24:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:32:00">[32:32:00]</a>.
    *   Ravindra Jadeja was sent ahead of Suryakumar Yadav in the batting order, a defensive move that [[Australias cricket strategy and performance in ODI World Cup 2023 | Australia]] likely would not have made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:05:00">[25:05:05]</a>.
    *   Suryakumar Yadav struggled to accelerate, indicating the difficulty in scoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:46:00">[25:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:43:00">[32:43:00]</a>.

## Bowling and Fielding Strategies
*   **New Ball Distribution**: Rohit Sharma's decision to give the new ball to Mohammed Shami instead of Mohammed Siraj was a change from India's usual strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:16:00">[18:16:00]</a>. While Shami had an exceptional record against left-handers in the tournament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:48:00">[17:48:00]</a>, he struggled more with the brand new ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:32:00">[18:32:00]</a>. This shift released some early pressure that India's usual new-ball pair would maintain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:38:00">[18:38:00]</a>.
*   **Siraj's Usage**: Siraj was brought on too late in the innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:27:00">[19:27:00]</a>. By the time he bowled, conditions were not in his favor, and [[Australias cricket strategy and performance in ODI World Cup 2023 | Australian batters]], particularly Travis Head, were waiting to attack him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:23:00">[46:23:00]</a>.
*   **Captaincy Decisions**: Rohit Sharma's tactical choices, while not necessarily massive errors, did not go in India's favor on the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:46:00">[37:46:00]</a>.

## Overall Performance and Outlook
India's performance in the final was disappointing, especially given their dominant run in the tournament. The team did not make many mistakes in terms of playing and selecting before the final <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>. However, in the high-pressure final, they couldn't solve the problems posed by [[Australias cricket strategy and performance in ODI World Cup 2023 | Australia's]] varied attack and the changing pitch conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. The general consensus was that the team had nine players in exceptional form coming into the game, but that wasn't consistently evident in the final <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:38:00">[58:38:00]</a>.

Despite the loss, the [[indian_cricket_team_performance_in_cwc_2023 | Indian cricket team]] may be considered one of the greatest teams to have not won a [[Cricket World Cup 2023 analysis | World Cup]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:16:00">[52:16:00]</a>. The team's consistency in the tournament was remarkable, but their natural conservative nature in knockout games, coupled with the absence of a strong number eight batter and an adaptable approach to changing conditions, ultimately led to their defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:09:00">[31:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:36:00">[59:36:00]</a>.

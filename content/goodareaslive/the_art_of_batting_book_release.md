## Core Premise & Content
The book explores the mindset and techniques of the world's best batters, highlighting their unique approaches to making runs [00:03:48]. It delves into the stories of players who did "whatever they have to to make runs" [00:03:50].

> The best batters in the world do whatever they have to to make runs. We have told their stories in our new book, The Art of Batting. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>

The book features various anecdotes, such as:
*   Brian Lara using pot plants for placement [00:03:28].
*   John Wright gluing his glove to his bat [00:03:30].
*   Sachin Tendulkar digging up practice pitches [00:03:32].
*   Cla Taylor using a hockey grip [00:03:38].
*   Steve Smith's background in tennis [00:03:40].
*   Dean Jones calling phantom runs [00:03:42].
*   Victor Trumper turning nets into a war zone [00:03:44].
*   Ross Taylor playing with impaired vision [01:30:43].

## Authorship and Research
Jared is the primary author of *The Art of Batting* [00:00:29]. Shyan Ahmed Khan served as the "head researcher" for the book, being deeply involved in the research, numbers, and data analysis [00:01:11]. Shyan's involvement helped him develop an interest in older historical players [00:02:07]. The research process involved initial lists based purely on ratios, analyzing the top 80 players, and then conducting forensic analysis on individual records [00:42:05].

## Batting Analysis & Player Selection
The book's methodology aims to go beyond raw averages, incorporating [[batting_performance_analysis_of_india_and_australia | advanced stats]] and contextual factors [00:09:20].

Key aspects of analysis include:
*   **Peak Performance vs. Longevity:** The book considers a player's peak performance against their overall career length and consistency [00:05:36].
*   **Match Factor:** [[batting_performance_analysis_of_india_and_australia | Advanced statistics]] like "match factor" were used to evaluate impact [00:09:20].
*   **Conditions and Era:** Performance in different conditions (home/away) and against different bowling attacks (e.g., West Indies fast bowlers) [00:09:33], as well as the scoring environment of the era (e.g., low-scoring 80s) [00:58:21], are factored in.
*   **Playing Position:** The difficulty of batting at different positions, especially opening, is considered [00:09:50], with some players (like David Gower and Bob Simpson) potentially having been better in different roles [00:09:54], [00:44:30].
*   **Context of Team Strength:** Batters from weaker teams (like Mahela Jayawardene for Sri Lanka [00:30:30] or Andy Flower for Zimbabwe [00:37:05]) are given credit for having to carry their side regardless of form [00:30:30], [00:37:09].
*   **Longevity and Career Path:** The book distinguishes between players who played throughout their careers (e.g., Younis Khan from his early 20s to his 80s [00:45:47]) and those who debuted later in their careers (e.g., Mike Hussey [00:46:20]) or had periods out of the team [00:30:47].
*   **Impact vs. Raw Numbers:** The book emphasizes the transformative impact of players like Kevin Pietersen on a game, even if their raw averages might not be the highest [01:08:04].

### Examples of Players Discussed in Relation to the Book's Research
*   **Virat Kohli:** Jared noted that many people contacted him to ensure Kohli was included, despite some opinions that he should be lower [00:05:27]. Kohli's exceptional peak is highlighted [00:05:36].
*   **Hanif Mohammad:** While a "really, really good player" and the "original little master" [00:05:53], [00:06:16], his record was carefully scrutinized and not rated in the "upper echelon" for the book [00:05:57].
*   **David Gower:** Surprisingly, Gower was rated much higher than expected in the research, almost making the top 50, due to his performance on [[batting_conditions_across_eras | advanced stats]] and his record against the West Indies in the West Indies [00:09:03].
*   **Neil Harvey:** An elegant player [00:07:17], known for lamenting the state of Australian cricket [00:07:49]. He was considered a "magnificent" player [00:08:57].
*   **Victor Trumper:** His quick scoring for his era was a significant factor in his evaluation, with his adjusted average in modern cricket estimated to be in the mid-40s [01:12:05]. He was an "inventor of attacking cricket" [01:10:45].
*   **Clyde Walcott:** While a great batter, his record was found to be "a bit more paper thin" upon closer examination [01:11:42].
*   **Ranjitsinhji:** Despite a fantastic Test average, he played very few matches [01:13:05]. His selection issues due to racial bias in England selectors were acknowledged [01:13:30].
*   **Herbert Sutcliffe:** An English opener with a high average, he is considered a great player who was "done dirty" by being matched early against Garfield Sober [01:14:54].
*   **Garfield Sober:** Though initial numbers didn't highly rate him, he was "pushed up the list" during research [01:15:21] due to his all-time great status and high strike rate for his era [01:15:54].
*   **Frank Worrell:** Considered "massively underrated" as a batter due to his consistency across conditions and his leadership qualities overshadowing his batting prowess [01:17:13].
*   **Rahul Dravid:** Recognized as a great player with a strong peak and the ability to make runs in various conditions, particularly in England and New Zealand [01:20:15].
*   **Vijay Hazare:** Despite a trophy named after him, his significant home/away split (70 at home, 36 away) prevented his inclusion in the book's main list [01:22:30].
*   **Jeffrey Boycott:** His quality as a pure batter is emphasized, with criticisms mostly stemming from his personality rather than his on-field performance [01:23:18].
*   **Wally Hammond:** Despite being labeled a "stat patter" in his time due to dominating New Zealand, removing those runs still shows him as one of the greatest [01:25:38]. He was also a hard-hitting player for his era [01:26:03].
*   **Steve Smith:** His initials SPD (Steven Peter Devereux) were mentioned, and his strong performance in the fourth innings was noted [01:26:42].
*   **Mahela Jayawardene:** His ability to play for Sri Lanka regardless of form and his nearly 9,000 runs in Asia make him a highly regarded batter [01:30:28].
*   **Usman Khawaja:** His numbers are seen as inflated due to not being in the side during less successful periods of his career [01:30:47].
*   **Clive Lloyd:** Known for his heavy bat and being an "incredible" player [01:33:02].
*   **Gundappa Viswanath:** A great player, but his struggles away from home, particularly against good bowling attacks, were a drawback [01:35:22].
*   **Andy Flower:** Highlighted as an "incredible" player who consistently performed under pressure for Zimbabwe, often coming in at 62/3 [01:37:05]. His high median entry point demonstrated his resilience [01:37:23].
*   **Ken Barrington:** Considered a strong player, preferred over Andy Flower due to his overall record [01:39:15].
*   **Gordon Greenidge:** Praised as an attacking opener without a "hole" in his career against lateral ball movement, unlike other aggressive openers [01:40:07].
*   **Javed Miandad:** Both Greenidge and Miandad played a bit too long, affecting their numbers [01:40:03].
*   **WG Grace:** A historically significant figure, highly rated in the book's metrics [01:41:59].
*   **Bob Simpson:** Despite good initial metrics, his complex career path (including a 10-year break from Test cricket due to lack of money) and inconsistent record meant he "misses out" on the top tier [01:42:52].
*   **Younis Khan:** Considered "way better than people think" and Pakistan's only batter with over 10,000 Test runs, plus a hundred in every country [01:47:35].
*   **Mike Hussey:** His career started later in his prime, making it difficult to compare to players who battled through their 20s at the Test level [01:46:20].
*   **Martin Crowe:** A "really important player" whose potential was hampered by knee injuries and declining fitness at the end of his career [01:50:41].
*   **Steve Waugh:** Started his career primarily as a bowler and developed into a strong batter, showing longevity [01:50:09].
*   **Inzamam-ul-Haq:** Considered an "automatic great" on the list, someone whose top 50 status cannot be argued against [01:54:13].
*   **Jack Hobbs:** Praised for his extraordinary first-class record (over 190 first-class hundreds) and impressive average in an era of lower scoring [01:54:39].
*   **Greg Chappell:** A "great batter" who missed out on Test matches due to World Series Cricket but maintained a high average [01:55:46].
*   **Graeme Smith:** Remembered as a captain, but also a "fantastic" batter, especially strong away from home, despite not conquering his home pitches [01:55:58].
*   **Allan Border:** One of the few players to average over 50 both home and away in a low-scoring era, carrying a weak Australian team [01:58:11].
*   **Virender Sehwag:** Known for his aggressive style [01:59:10], but his struggles against the moving ball were noted [02:04:02].
*   **Len Hutton:** Unanimously chosen over Dean Jones [02:00:21].
*   **Dean Jones:** A fascinating player with two double hundreds, but his Test career was cut short due to team balance and his personality [02:00:31].
*   **Justin Langer & Michael Clarke:** Both played in a "great batting era" with inflated numbers [02:04:52]. Langer as an opener was seen as having a tougher job than Clarke batting at number five [02:05:10].
*   **Kevin Pietersen:** A "controversial top 50 batter" but loved by the authors for his "unparalleled" ability to change a game [02:07:30]. His aggressive mindset and iconic innings (e.g., 2005 Ashes, 149 vs. Dale Steyn, Colombo) are highlighted [02:08:45].
*   **George Headley:** The "black Bradman" was favored over Pietersen [02:10:31].
*   **VVS Laxman & Graeme Thorpe:** Both considered great, with Laxman having more "iconic" and game-changing knocks [02:11:32]. Thorpe is noted as "massively underrated" [02:11:52].
*   **Mohammad Yousuf:** His inclusion on the list was debated, with his exceptional 2006 year being a significant factor [02:12:48].
*   **Viv Richards:** Unsurprisingly went through against Mohammad Yousuf [02:14:13].
*   **Rohan Kanhai:** Considered a "forgotten great" who didn't get the credit he deserved due to teammates' high scoring [02:14:50].
*   **Kumar Sangakkara:** A unanimous choice, holding the highest batting average among the 10k Test run club (57.4) [02:16:17].
*   **Saqlain Mushtaq:** Mentioned as someone whose career was cut short, potentially a better Test player than ODI player [02:17:04].
*   **Zaheer Abbas:** Dubbed the "Asian Bradman," but his Test peak was relatively short, with his ODI record being "ridiculous" [02:19:52].
*   **Joe Root & Hashim Amla:** Root is seen as "miles ahead" of Amla, despite Amla's strong peak and good away record [02:20:51].
*   **AB de Villiers & Everton Weekes:** De Villiers, with his "all the gears" and versatile approach, was preferred over Weekes, whose numbers were seen as inflated by a few key matchups [02:22:26].
*   **Kane Williamson & Alastair Cook:** A close call, with Cook slightly ahead due to his performances against the best teams (e.g., Australia 2010-11, India) [02:23:00]. Williamson's struggles against top sides are noted [02:24:14].
*   **Graeme Pollock & Matthew Hayden:** Both considered similar types of players, with Hayden's longer career and impactful scoring elevating him [02:25:33].
*   **Shivnarine Chanderpaul & Jacques Kallis:** Kallis was a unanimous choice [02:28:45]. Chanderpaul's unique batting stance and ability to not get out at the end of his career are highlighted [02:29:19].

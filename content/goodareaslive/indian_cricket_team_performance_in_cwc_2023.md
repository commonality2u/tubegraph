The [[indian_cricket_teams_challenges_and_strategies_in_odi_world_cup_2023 | Indian team]] has displayed a dominant performance throughout the 2023 Cricket World Cup, with no apparent weaknesses in their squad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:07">[02:19:07]</a>. Their current form suggests they are "just better than everyone else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:44">[03:02:44]</a>.

## Overall Team Strength
The [[indian_cricket_teams_challenges_and_strategies_in_odi_world_cup_2023 | Indian team]] is in such incredible form that even if they were to bat with a "bruised cumquat at number seven", they would still likely be undefeated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:55">[02:20:55]</a>. They could "almost void the position seven and eight" and still perform exceptionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:30">[02:28:30]</a>. The team's collective form is a significant factor, with nearly every player performing well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:24">[02:42:24]</a>.

The hosts could have potentially "voided the eighth position" in their lineup and still been undefeated in the tournament, showcasing their unparalleled dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:33">[03:31:33]</a>. Their strong form makes them incredibly difficult to beat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:39">[04:25:39]</a>.

### Comparison to Historical Dominance
While highly dominant, the 2023 [[indian_cricket_teams_challenges_and_strategies_in_odi_world_cup_2023 | Indian team]] is compared to the 2003 and 2007 [[australias_cricket_strategy_and_performance_in_odi_world_cup_2023 | Australian teams]], which are still considered the most dominant in World Cup history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:40">[04:43:40]</a>. The [[australian_cricket_team_performance_trends | Australian teams]] achieved their dominance away from home, adding an extra layer to their achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:13">[04:52:13]</a>. The 2003 [[australian_cricket_team_performance_trends | Australian team]] had an incredible bowling unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:56">[04:56:56]</a>, while the 2007 [[australian_cricket_team_performance_trends | Australian team]] was the best batting team, averaging 15 runs more per wicket than current India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:55">[05:06:55]</a>.

Despite their current success, the [[indian_cricket_teams_challenges_and_strategies_in_odi_world_cup_2023 | Indian team]] faces the historical challenge of dominant teams not winning the World Cup, such as New Zealand in 1992 and South Africa in 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:02">[04:58:02]</a>.

## Batting Performance
The [[indian_cricket_teams_challenges_and_strategies_in_odi_world_cup_2023 | Indian batting]] has been exceptional, starting with high intent at the top of the order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:23">[01:00:23]</a>. India has been scoring at a fast rate in the power play, averaging around 50 runs, which is "good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:57">[01:14:57]</a>.

### Key Batters
*   **Virat Kohli**: Kohli played an anchor role against South Africa, starting quickly in the first 10 overs but slowing down in the middle overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:58">[01:11:58]</a>. This strategic slowdown was likely to avoid losing wickets against effective bowlers like Keshav Maharaj, as Kohli's technique against spinning balls away from him has changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:41">[04:09:41]</a>. He holds the joint-most hundreds in ODI history and is expected to surpass Tendulkar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>. Kohli's current form is "absolutely phenomenal" despite his age, and he could finish as the leading run-scorer in the tournament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:04">[11:10:04]</a>.
*   **Rohit Sharma**: Rohit "went nuts" at the start of the innings against South Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:10:48]</a>, contributing to India's aggressive power play strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:41">[01:41:41]</a>.
*   **Shreyas Iyer**: Iyer, batting at number four, showed the ability to adjust his strike rate based on the game situation and opposition bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. He respected strong bowlers while cashing in against others, such as Marco Jansen and part-time spinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:19">[01:54:19]</a>. He is seen as a "World Cup quality number four" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.
*   **Suryakumar Yadav (SKY)**: SKY's role as a finisher at number six, similar to Liam Livingstone or Jos Buttler, is seen as a "huge bonus" for the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:36">[02:00:36]</a>. He can score at "crazy rates," even on tricky pitches where the ball softens and causes trouble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:43">[02:05:43]</a>.
*   **Ravindra Jadeja**: Despite coming into the tournament with questions about his form, Jadeja has solidified his position as one of the best number sevens in ODI history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:36">[02:20:36]</a>. He became only the third number seven in ODI history to score 2,000 runs in that position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:56">[02:27:56]</a>. His recent form shows a significant improvement in both average and strike rate compared to the last two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:15">[02:49:15]</a>.

## Bowling Performance
The [[indian_cricket_teams_challenges_and_strategies_in_odi_world_cup_2023 | Indian bowling attack]] is world-class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:58">[02:08:58]</a>, contributing to their ability to defend any total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.

### Key Bowlers
*   **Mohammed Shami**: Shami struggled early on but bowled well at the death, with an economy rate of 7.25, considered good when the opposing team was pushing for runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:52">[02:50:52]</a>. He is a better T20 bowler than ODI bowler because he thrives when batters attack him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:05">[02:54:05]</a>.
*   **Ravindra Jadeja**: Jadeja was the main spinner against South Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:44">[03:23:44]</a>. The decision to bowl him in the power play was based on the pitch conditions, which suited spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:51">[03:17:51]</a>.
*   **Jasprit Bumrah**: Bumrah's unique action and hyper-extension of the elbow contribute to his effectiveness, making him a "freakish bowler" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:37">[05:37:37]</a>. His ability to cause issues on good batting wickets is noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:09">[05:50:09]</a>.
*   **Kuldeep Yadav**: Kuldeep is expected to cause issues even on flat batting wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:09">[05:50:09]</a>.
*   **Mohammed Siraj**: Siraj's presence, along with Shami and Bumrah, ensures a formidable pace attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:09">[05:50:09]</a>.

## Strategies and Adaptations
The [[indian_cricket_teams_challenges_and_strategies_in_odi_world_cup_2023 | Indian team's]] strategy has shifted from a more conservative approach in previous tournaments to an aggressive, wicket-taking focus in CWC 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:58">[01:08:58]</a>. This shift was influenced by internal discussions after their failure in the last T20 World Cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:56">[01:09:56]</a>. They decided to pick bowlers who take wickets and play aggressively, even if it meant taking more risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>.

> [!info] Batting First vs. Chasing
> It is debated whether batting first or second is India's strength. While some believe batting second is stronger due to their world-class bowling putting scoreboard pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:58">[02:08:58]</a>, others argue it "probably doesn't matter" for India given their current dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:23">[03:00:23]</a>. They have the flexibility to choose based on conditions or opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:06">[03:10:06]</a>.

## Concerns and Conspiracy Theories
A common concern for India in ICC events is their past performance in knockout games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:23">[01:18:23]</a>. The team's current run raises questions about "peaking too early" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:32">[01:11:32]</a>.

Conspiracy theories regarding the ball, pitch, and DRS favoring India are dismissed as "nonsense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:25">[01:02:25]</a>. The argument that Indian bowlers are doing well due to extra lacquer on the ball is debunked as seam bowling is prevalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>. Comparisons of spin on the same pitch show that a South African bowler (Maharaj) actually spun the ball more than an Indian bowler (Jadeja) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:11">[01:02:11]</a>. The exceptional form of Indian bowlers like Shami, Bumrah, and Siraj predates the tournament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>.

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed markdown-embed-clipboard">

> [!quote] Addressing "Selfish" Innings
> Virat Kohli's slower innings to reach his hundred is defended, suggesting it was not selfish but a strategic decision based on pitch conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:15">[03:49:15]</a>. He likely aimed to consolidate and prevent further wicket loss when the ball began spinning more and causing trouble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:04">[03:59:04]</a>.

## Avoiding Semifinal/Final Losses
To avoid past failures in semifinals or finals, the [[indian_cricket_teams_challenges_and_strategies_in_odi_world_cup_2023 | Indian team]] must focus on taking early wickets against strong batting sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. Taking three wickets in the first 15-25 overs can significantly impact the game, as India's batting depth is not as strong as teams that bat down to eight or nine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:22">[01:15:22]</a>. The team needs to "problem solve on the flight" during critical moments if their initial plans don't work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:18">[01:16:18]</a>.

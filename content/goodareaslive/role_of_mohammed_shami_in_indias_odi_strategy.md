Mohammed Shami has emerged as a crucial component of India's One Day International (ODI) strategy, particularly in the World Cup, showcasing exceptional wicket-taking ability and contributing significantly to India's victories.

## Unexpected "Ridiculous Weapon"

Initially, there was a possibility that [[Role of key players in Indias cricket team | Mohammed Shami]] might not have played in the World Cup had [[Importance of allrounders in Indias ODI team | Hardik Pandya]] not sustained an injury, despite India potentially still winning the tournament [02:38:00]. His presence on the bench as such a skilled bowler was described as having a "ridiculous weapon" at their disposal, a rarity in World Cup Cricket history [02:48:00].

## Exceptional World Cup Performance
[[Role and performance of key players like Bumrah Shami and Gill in the World Cup | Mohammed Shami]] has a remarkable record in World Cup matches. He boasts the best strike rate in the tournament's history among bowlers with a minimum of 20 wickets [03:44:00]. He has taken 36 wickets in just 12 World Cup matches [03:42:00]. While it's acknowledged that he hasn't played every single game, and might have been selected when conditions favored him, taking 36 wickets in 12 matches is considered "absolutely fantastic" regardless [03:53:00].

In a specific match against New Zealand, his spell was instrumental in shifting the game "massively in favor of India" from a near-par situation [02:07:00]. He also took an early wicket and later dismissed Daryl Mitchell [04:21:00].

### Bowling Prowess
Shami's bowling is characterized by several key attributes:
*   **Seam Movement and Pace** He effectively moves the ball back in off the seam, cramping batters, and has a strong death bowling ability [04:30:00]. He maintains good pace and can move the ball in either direction [05:38:00].
*   **Versatility** Unlike many bowlers who can only swing or seam, Shami's "incredible wrist" allows him to do both [05:59:00].
*   **Smartness and Control** Over recent years, he has added "a lot of smarts as a bowler" in the one-day format while retaining pace and sideways movement [05:53:00].

## Impact on India's Bowling Strategy
[[Indias bowling strategy and selection in ODIs | Shami's inclusion]] bolsters India's formidable bowling attack. India possesses five, and potentially six if [[Importance of allrounders in Indias ODI team | Hardik Pandya]] returns, [[Indias bowling strategy and selection in ODIs | strike bowlers]] [07:06:00]. This depth means they are "always a threat of getting wickets" [07:16:00]. Unlike teams that need to "manufacture wickets" with "weird fields or weird plans," India's bowlers, including Shami, can take regular wickets "while just bowling normally," which is a huge advantage [07:25:00].

His performance against New Zealand was seen as the primary reason for India's victory, as he prevented New Zealand from accelerating at the death, allowing India to win comfortably [08:01:00].

## Comparisons and Future Outlook
While his World Cup record is phenomenal, discussions arise when comparing him to other great bowlers like Mitchell Starc. Starc has a higher overall wicket count in World Cups over more games, and has had a bigger impact on two tournaments [04:50:00], making it difficult to definitively call Shami the "GOAT" of World Cup bowling at this stage [04:47:00]. However, his current performance is seen as "absolutely fantastic" [04:55:00]. If he continues his wicket-taking rate over more matches, he could certainly be considered in that elite discussion [05:16:00].

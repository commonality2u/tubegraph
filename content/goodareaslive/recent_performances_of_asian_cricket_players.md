This drafting exercise highlighted several [[top_asian_test_cricket_bowlers_and_batters | top performers]] from Asian cricketing nations.

## Batters

### Kamindu Mendes (Sri Lanka)
[[emerging_cricket_talents_and_their_impact | Kamindu Mendes]] was a controversial first pick due to his exceptional recent form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. He has played seven Tests this year, scoring 943 runs at an average of 94.3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. Mendes reached 1,000 runs in eight Test matches, a record achieved quicker than Don Bradman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. His overall average is 91.27, with five centuries in eight Test matches, including one in England, demonstrating his ability as an "all conditions batter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. He is versatile, capable of batting anywhere from positions 4 to 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.

### Yashasvi Jaiswal (India)
[[performance_of_debutant_cricket_players | Yashasvi Jaiswal]] was selected as an opener for the drafted team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. Despite being new to the game, he averages over 56 in 14 Test matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>. He is considered aesthetically pleasing to watch and is expected to score a significant number of runs for India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.

### Rishabh Pant (India)
[[performance_of_indian_cricketers_in_recent_tests | Rishabh Pant]] was chosen despite India's recent struggles in Test cricket, such as being swept by New Zealand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>. He was a "beacon of hope," consistently scoring runs and acting as a match-winner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>. He has returned magnificently after a prolonged injury break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>.

### Saud Shakeel (Pakistan)
[[performance_of_indian_cricters_in_recent_tests | Saud Shakeel]] was selected to bat at number five <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:00">[10:38:00]</a>. He has made "a million runs" in the last couple of years, despite some concerns about his [[australian_cricket_team_performance_trends | performance in different conditions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>. He is particularly strong against spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>.

### Salman Agha (Pakistan)
Salman Agha was a "biased pick" but justified by his numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>. He has had a "terrific year," with consistent runs since the series against Sri Lanka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a>. He often bails Pakistan out, is fantastic against spin, and is improving against pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:00">[12:32:00]</a>. He averages 46 runs with the bat in 17 Test matches, which is currently more than Babar Azam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:00">[12:44:00]</a>.

### Shubman Gill (India)
[[performance_of_indian_cricketers_in_recent_tests | Shubman Gill]] was selected to bat at first drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:28:00">[13:28:00]</a>. He averages 47.4 in Test cricket this calendar year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>. Despite heavy criticism prior to his recent form, he is now considered one of India's most in-form batters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:36:00">[13:36:00]</a>.

### Dimuth Karunaratne (Sri Lanka)
[[drafting_a_current_asian_test_cricket_team | Dimuth Karunaratne]] was chosen as an opener <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:23:00">[14:23:00]</a>. He has been one of the top four opening batters over the last six or seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:42:00">[14:42:00]</a>. In the last 24 Test matches, he has made almost 2,000 runs with four centuries and 13 fifties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>. Although he has no centuries this year, he is considered a safe pick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>.

### Others
*   **Mohammad Rizwan (Pakistan):** Considered the only other option from Pakistan for the wicket-keeper role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>.
*   **Angelo Mathews (Sri Lanka):** Has made a lot of runs in the last couple of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:33:00">[18:33:00]</a>.
*   **Pathum Nissanka (Sri Lanka):** A tempting option, considered a potential top opener in the future if he plays more Test cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:36:00">[15:36:00]</a>. His limited Test appearances are due to protection from a back injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01:00">[16:01:00]</a>.
*   **Rahmat Shah (Afghanistan):** Averages 32 in Test cricket batting at number three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:39:00">[16:39:00]</a>.
*   **Hashmatullah Shahidi (Afghanistan):** Averages 44 from eight games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:54:00">[16:54:00]</a>.
*   **Ibrahim Zadran (Afghanistan):** Averages 38 from seven games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:01:00">[17:01:00]</a>.

## Bowlers

### Jasprit Bumrah (India)
[[top_asian_test_cricket_bowlers_and_batters | Jasprit Bumrah]] has a strong record of 173 wickets in 40 Test matches, averaging 20.57 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. His 2024 performance is even better, with 41 wickets in nine Tests at an average of 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.

### Ravindra Jadeja (India)
[[notable_cricket_fielding_performances | Ravindra Jadeja]] was an easy pick for the team, certain to be included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.

### Ravichandran Ashwin (India)
[[performance_of_indian_cricketers_in_recent_tests | Ravichandran Ashwin]] was chosen as a second spinner, providing an additional batting option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>. Despite a recent "worst ever series," his overall form before that was strong, including a Man of the Match performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:47:00">[23:47:00]</a>.

### Asitha Fernando (Sri Lanka)
[[top_asian_test_cricket_bowlers_and_batters | Asitha Fernando]] is considered the easily second-best fast bowler in Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>. He has been consistently good for Sri Lanka, carrying their attack both at home and overseas, and has a good wicket tally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>. He is arguably the best Test fast bowler in Sri Lanka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.

### Hasan Mahmud (Bangladesh)
[[emerging_cricket_talents_and_their_impact | Hasan Mahmud]] was picked as the third seamer, representing Bangladesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:50:00">[17:50:00]</a>. He has had the most success among Bangladeshi fast bowlers, with 23 wickets in seven games at an average of 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:55:00">[17:55:00]</a>. He is known for getting five-wicket hauls and putting his team in good positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:05:00">[18:05:00]</a>. Mahmud is pinpoint accurate, bowls a nagging length, and is deceptively quick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:10:00">[19:10:00]</a>.

### Others
*   **Mohammad Shami (India):** While not fit for current selection, if available, he would be a strong contender for the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>. He recently took four wickets in a Ranji Trophy game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:38:00">[20:38:00]</a>.
*   **Taskin Ahmed (Bangladesh):** Considered as another option for a seamer, especially given his recent improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:51:00">[19:51:00]</a>.
*   **Nahid Rana (Bangladesh):** A "new speed demon" but hasn't yet shown consistent Test numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:26:00">[19:26:00]</a>.
*   **Vishva Fernando (Sri Lanka):** Offers a left-arm option but Asitha Fernando was preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>.
*   **Mehidy Hasan Miraz (Bangladesh):** A strong player for Bangladesh, but overlaps with India's strong spin options like Ashwin and Jadeja <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>.
*   **Taijul Islam (Bangladesh):** Another strong spin option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:17:00">[23:17:00]</a>.
*   **Nauman Ali (Pakistan):** A key part of Pakistan's spin combination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:24:00">[23:24:00]</a>.

Australia faced significant challenges in their Champions Trophy semifinal match against India in Dubai, ultimately losing by four wickets with 11 deliveries to spare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. Despite India being overwhelming favourites due to missing Australian players and favourable conditions, Australia pushed them harder than any other team in the tournament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

## Missed Opportunities

Australia had several opportunities to seize control of the game but failed to capitalise:
*   **Batting Position** At 36 overs, Australia was 196 for four, a position from which they could have scored 300 or more runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. However, they only managed to add 68 runs from that point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">[12:22:00]</a>.
*   **Dropped Catches** Three crucial catches were dropped, including Rohit Sharma twice and Virat Kohli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>. The dropped catch of Virat Kohli in the chase in an ICC knockout fixture was particularly detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. Cooper Connelly's dropped catch of Rohit was due to a miscommunication with Glenn Maxwell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>.

## Pitch Conditions

The pitch behavior was unexpected:
*   The wicket started slow, but somehow got faster as the innings went on, which was the opposite of what was anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. It was still a tricky pitch, but manageable if batsmen weren't trying to hit boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>.
*   Contrary to expectations, the pitch did not spin much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>, making it more suited to finger spinners rather than wrist spinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:22:00">[36:22:00]</a>.

## Batting Performance

### Travis Head
Travis Head got a life when Shami dropped his catch early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>. After his reprieve, he "went a bit berserk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. However, he was dismissed first ball by Varun Chakaravarthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>. He delivered the expected start in the power play (39 off 33 balls) but needed to bat for another 10 overs for Australia to be in a winning position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>.

### Steve Smith
Steve Smith's innings of 73 off 96 balls (strike rate of 76) was considered too slow to put Australia in a winning position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:58:00">[15:58:00]</a>. He started by rotating the strike well and using his feet against spinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:33:00">[12:33:00]</a>, but then got stuck at the crease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>. His dismissal to a full toss from Mohammed Shami was described as "comical fashion" and occurred at a terrible time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>. Smith himself would likely admit he "choked up too many dot balls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:23:00">[17:23:00]</a>.

## Bowling and Team Selection

Australia went into the match with an experimental side, including two young spinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:00">[09:59:00]</a>.
*   **Spinner Selection** Both teams opted for an extra spinner, which was deemed incorrect given the pitch conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:00">[10:38:00]</a>. Tanveer Sangha, not typically an attacking leg-spinner in ODI cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>, was chosen over a pace option like Spencer Johnson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>.
*   **Defensive Options** Australia's bowling attack heavily relied on defensive options such as Cooper Connelly, Glenn Maxwell, and Nathan Ellis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a>. This strategy required Australia to be "massively ahead of par" with their batting to win, which they were not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Pace** The absence of key pace bowlers like Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood, and Mitchell Starc meant their stand-ins, such as Dawaes, were not at the same level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:47:00">[39:47:00]</a>. Nathan Ellis, while a good defensive bowler, was not the "strike bowler" needed for this game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:53:00">[39:53:00]</a>.
*   **Missed Clusters of Wickets** Australia struggled to take back-to-back wickets, allowing India to build partnerships between dismissals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:22:00">[27:22:00]</a>.

## Overall Strategy
Australia's strategy was to "win it with defensive bowling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:08:00">[15:08:00]</a>. This required them to be "above par" in their scoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:03:00">[15:03:00]</a>. However, their struggles with strike rotation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:23:00">[31:23:00]</a> and inability to force breakthroughs put undue pressure on their side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:27:00">[31:27:00]</a>.

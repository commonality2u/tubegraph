Dew, a significant factor in T20 cricket, particularly in regions like India, Pakistan, and the UAE, has long impacted match outcomes by providing an advantage to chasing teams and potentially diminishing the quality of contests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. This phenomenon can make the ball slippery, difficult for bowlers (especially spinners and those relying on slower deliveries) to grip, and can ruin the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. The 2021 T20 World Cup, won by Australia, is cited as a tournament where the toss, influenced by dew, played a dominant role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.

## IPL's New Rule to Counter Dew

The Indian Premier League (IPL), known for introducing radical rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>, has implemented a new regulation to address the wet ball challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

> "What the IPL have done to kind of counter this is that after 11 overs in the second innings... the bowling side has the option to change the ball once and have a different cherry but not an entirely new cherry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:50">[02:48:50]</a>.

This rule aims to level the playing field by mitigating the advantage that chasing teams gain due to dew in the second innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>. While the exact timing is debated (some sources suggest after the 10th over) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>, the essence is providing the bowling side a tactical choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

### Tactical Implications for Captains

The new rule introduces a complex strategic decision for captains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>:
*   **When to change the ball**: Captains must decide the optimal time to request a ball change, considering the dew's severity and their bowlers' strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.
*   **Bowler management**: This decision will influence how captains utilize their bowlers, especially those suited for a wet ball (e.g., Rashid Khan) versus those who struggle with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.
*   **Dew consistency**: Dew is inconsistent; sometimes it helps bowling, sometimes batting, and its appearance can be unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>. A wrong decision could leave a team "stuffed" if the replacement ball also gets wet quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.

## Limitations and Future Solutions

While a "good step in the right direction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>, the current system is not perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.
*   **Dew persists**: Replacing the ball once doesn't make the dew disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. The replacement ball will eventually get wet again, especially since older balls react worse to moisture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.
*   **Umpire involvement**: It's suggested that umpires should have complete control over ball changes, taking the decision out of the captain's hands to avoid strategic manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.
*   **More ball changes**: A "perfect system" might involve replacing the ball whenever it becomes too wet, potentially meaning using four balls in a game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.
*   **Material innovation**: Exploring waterproof leather or using pink balls in white-ball cricket could be long-term solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.
*   **Stadium roofs**: Ultimately, covered stadiums might be the most effective way to eliminate dew's impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.

## Overall Impact

The goal of these evolving strategies is to prevent games from "fizzling out" due to uncontrollable factors like dew, thereby enhancing the competitive aspect of T20 cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. While the IPL is at the forefront of implementing such changes, the slow pace of broader adoption in cricket is often attributed to conservatism and conflicting interests within governing bodies like the BCCI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>. Despite these challenges, the continuous experimentation in T20 leagues contributes to the broader [[evolution_of_cricket_strategies_and_player_roles | evolution of cricket strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.

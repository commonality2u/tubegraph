The podcast discusses the "Art of Batting," a new book that ranks the greatest batters of all time, and in doing so, reveals the complex [[methods_of_evaluating_cricket_players | methods of evaluating cricket players]] used for such a list. The hosts engage in a "knockout" format, comparing players head-to-head and explaining their rationale, thereby shedding light on the [[selection_criteria for cricket teams | selection criteria for cricket teams]] used to assess individual careers and performances.

## General Considerations in Ranking Batters

The discussions highlight several key criteria used to rank players:

*   **Overall Record and Statistics** Players' career averages, total runs, and centuries are fundamental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. For example, Sunil Gavaskar is noted for averaging "50 plus as opener" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a> and being "the first to 10,000" runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Javed Miandad's consistent average of over 50 throughout his career was a significant factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. Ken Barrington's "incredible" record of 6,800 runs at an average of 58 in 82 Test matches is also highlighted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>.
*   **Peak Performance vs. Longevity** The duration and dominance of a player's peak form are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Ricky Ponting's peak was considered exceptional, but his performance outside of it was "okay when he was young and... below average when he was old" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Longevity, such as Javed Miandad playing 120 Tests and never dropping below a 50 average, also counts significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. Sachin Tendulkar is praised for being "great every single day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:21">[00:40:21]</a> and his consistency across different age groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>.
*   **Era and Conditions** The strength of opposition bowling attacks and the general batting conditions of the era in which a player played are critical for [[challenges_of_ranking_historical_data_and_records_in_cricket | challenges of ranking historical data and records in cricket]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Ken Barrington's record is scrutinized because he "made some runs against some fairly ordinary attacks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a> and "didn't play as many of the great players" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>. Conversely, Allan Border's performances against the "West Indies at their best" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a> are noted. The difficulty of scoring runs in the professional era is also acknowledged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:12">[00:52:12]</a>.
*   **Playing Style and Impact** The "contrasting styles of play" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, such as attacking vs. defensive, and the player's ability to "change a game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a> are considered. Viv Richards' "ability to change a game so violently" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:21">[00:46:21]</a> is highly valued, despite his raw numbers perhaps being lower.
*   **Technical Flaws and Versatility** Even great players might have had technical flaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Versatility, such as AB de Villiers' wicket-keeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a> or Garfield Sobers' bowling workload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, can add to their value.
*   **Batting Position** The difficulty of batting at certain positions, like opening the innings or batting at number three, is recognized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. Steve Waugh's preference for batting at number five, even when the team needed him higher, is seen as a point against him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.
*   **"Not Outs" and Average Padding** While "not outs" inflate averages, their context is debated, especially if a player was avoiding facing the new ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. Steve Waugh's desire to maintain a 50+ average and how it might have influenced his batting decisions is discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.
*   **Intangibles and "Vibes"** Personal biases, the "coolness factor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>, and subjective "vibes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a> also influence individual opinions. The perceived "mad genius vibe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a> of players like Javed Miandad and WG Grace is mentioned. The terrifying presence of players like Clive Lloyd and Viv Richards is also noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>.
*   **Impact of External Factors** Injuries (Len Hutton losing an inch off his elbow) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a>, wars (WG Grace, Len Hutton, Don Bradman) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>, and early retirements (AB de Villiers, Alastair Cook) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a> are all considered to impact career statistics and how players are perceived.

## Specific Player Comparisons and Rationale

The knockout rounds provided concrete examples of these criteria in action:

*   **Virat Kohli vs. Neil Harvey**: Kohli advanced unanimously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Harvey, despite a great start to his Test career, had "some holes in his record" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   **Victor Trumper vs. Sunil Gavaskar**: Gavaskar was the unanimous pick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Trumper was an excellent attacking player and on wet wickets, but Gavaskar's consistent average as an opener and his status as the "first to 10,000" runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a> placed him on a "completely different level" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   **Garfield Sobers vs. Ricky Ponting**: Sobers was preferred unanimously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Ponting's peak was exceptional, but Sobers had "more weapons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>, more power, a better average, and "fewer flaws in sober's record" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, especially considering his bowling workload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a> and lower batting position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   **Don Bradman vs. Geoff Boycott**: Bradman was the unanimous choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Boycott was "underestimated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a> as a "fantastic player" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a> but was seen as inferior to Gavaskar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   **Steve Smith vs. Mahela Jayawardene**: Smith advanced unanimously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Jayawardene was highly regarded, especially against spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, but Smith's overall record was seen as superior.
*   **Clive Lloyd vs. Ken Barrington**: Barrington was chosen over Lloyd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a> due to Barrington's "incredible" record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>, despite Lloyd's "coolness factor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a> and domineering style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. However, concerns were raised about the quality of attacks Barrington faced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a>.
*   **Javed Miandad vs. WG Grace**: Miandad advanced in a split vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. Miandad's longevity (120 Tests) and consistent 50+ average were key factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. Grace's historical dominance, including his continued high performance into his 40s despite becoming a doctor, was acknowledged, but his limited Test appearances due to the era made his case harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
*   **Younis Khan vs. Steve Waugh**: Younis Khan advanced unanimously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. Waugh's "not outs" and his refusal to bat higher in the order when needed were seen as limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. Younis's willingness to bat at number three for Pakistan, despite frequent early wickets, was a plus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.
*   **Jack Hobbs vs. Greg Chappell**: Hobbs advanced unanimously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. Chappell was a "fantastic player" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>, but Hobbs's legendary status and prolific first-class record, including his ability to dominate across generations, were insurmountable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:21">[00:49:21]</a>.
*   **Allan Border vs. Len Hutton**: Hutton was the unanimous pick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. Border was a "great player" and "warrior" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>, but Hutton was simply deemed "better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>. Hutton's "impeccable" record, resilience after injury, and continued dominance despite World War II made him a unique case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:55">[00:34:55]</a>.
*   **Michael Clarke vs. George Headley**: Headley won unanimously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. Headley's "insane" runs and high batting average in his early career were noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:55">[00:37:55]</a>.
*   **VVS Laxman vs. Viv Richards**: Richards was the unanimous choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>. Laxman's "overall record's not very good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a> on the metrics used, despite his "couple of innings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.
*   **Sachin Tendulkar vs. Kumar Sangakkara**: Tendulkar advanced unanimously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>. Sangakkara is considered "Sri Lanka's best batter ever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a> and a "top 10 batter of all time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>, but Tendulkar's 200 Test matches and consistent greatness were decisive.
*   **Brian Lara vs. Joe Root**: Lara was the unanimous pick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>. While Root has been consistently making runs and rising in the rankings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>, Lara's destructive prowess and unique achievements (like the 400 not out) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a> are incomparable.
*   **AB de Villiers vs. Alastair Cook**: Jacques Kallis was the unanimous choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>. Kallis was recognized as the "best batter in Test cricket to come out of South Africa" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.
*   **Matthew Hayden vs. Jacques Kallis**: Kallis was the unanimous choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>. Kallis's "all-format" ability, longevity, and bowling workload outweighed Hayden's "fear factor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>.
*   **Virat Kohli vs. Sunil Gavaskar (Round of 16)**: Gavaskar won unanimously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>. While Kohli had a period where he seemed close, his later career form and easier home conditions were considered against him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. Gavaskar's consistent excellence "till the very end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a> was highlighted.
*   **Don Bradman vs. Garfield Sobers (Round of 16)**: Bradman won unanimously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>.
*   **Steve Smith vs. Ken Barrington (Round of 16)**: Smith won unanimously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>. Barrington's record, while impressive, was deemed to have been compiled against "fairly ordinary attacks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a> and did not hold up as strongly in first-class cricket in England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">[00:30:15]</a>.
*   **Javed Miandad vs. Younis Khan (Round of 16)**: This was a split vote for Miandad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. Miandad's consistent average and playing against tougher bowlers in a tougher period were cited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>.
*   **Jack Hobbs vs. Len Hutton (Round of 16)**: Hobbs won unanimously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>. Hutton's "almost impeccable" record and resilience despite significant career disruptions were highly praised, but Hobbs's remarkable longevity and consistent dominance across eras ultimately prevailed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:55">[00:34:55]</a>.
*   **George Headley vs. Viv Richards (Round of 16)**: Richards won unanimously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>. While Headley's early record was "insane" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:55">[00:37:55]</a>, Richards' impact and ability to "change a game so violently" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:21">[00:46:21]</a> were decisive.
*   **Sachin Tendulkar vs. Brian Lara (Round of 16)**: Tendulkar won unanimously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>. While Lara had higher peaks of "genius" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:04">[00:40:04]</a>, Tendulkar's consistent greatness "every single day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:21">[00:40:21]</a> and incredible longevity (200 Tests) made him the choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:58">[00:41:58]</a>.
*   **AB de Villiers vs. Jacques Kallis (Round of 16)**: Kallis won unanimously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>. Kallis is considered "the best batter in test cricket to come out of South Africa" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>, and while AB de Villiers had the potential, Kallis's all-round contribution and record cemented his place.
*   **Don Bradman vs. Sunil Gavaskar (Quarterfinal)**: Bradman won unanimously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>. Gavaskar's top-eight finish was considered "perfect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a> for his standing.
*   **Steve Smith vs. Javed Miandad (Quarterfinal)**: Smith won unanimously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:09">[00:45:09]</a>.
*   **Jack Hobbs vs. Viv Richards (Quarterfinal)**: Hobbs won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:38">[00:45:38]</a>. Richards' raw numbers might not place him as high, but his impact and ability to "change a game so violently" were unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:21">[00:46:21]</a>.
*   **Sachin Tendulkar vs. Jacques Kallis (Quarterfinal)**: Tendulkar won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:41">[00:47:41]</a>. Kallis was considered "lucky to make the quarterfinals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:49">[00:47:49]</a>, but Tendulkar's consistent excellence was too much.
*   **Don Bradman vs. Steve Smith (Semifinal)**: Bradman won unanimously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:04">[00:49:04]</a>.
*   **Sachin Tendulkar vs. Jack Hobbs (Semifinal)**: Tendulkar won unanimously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:04">[00:49:04]</a>. Hobbs's remarkable first-class record and multi-generational dominance were acknowledged, but Tendulkar's overall career was preferred.

## The Greatest Batters of All Time: Don Bradman

The final match-up was between Don Bradman and Sachin Tendulkar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:38">[00:50:38]</a>, with Bradman unanimously chosen as the greatest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:52">[00:50:52]</a>.

> "The issue is Don Bradman doesn't have a case for being number two" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:21">[00:51:21]</a>.

Bradman's average of 99.94 is a key differentiator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:02">[00:51:02]</a>. While critics might point to the era he played in, no other player averaged 40 more than the next best batter of their era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a>. He consistently averaged "almost double what other great players did in their era" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:06">[00:52:06]</a> throughout his career. Even after missing years due to World War II and having less than 20/20 vision, he "averaged more after the war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:23">[00:54:23]</a>. His dominance across different sports periods and against strong bowling lineups in Shield cricket is cited as evidence against common criticisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:44">[00:55:44]</a>.

## Subjectivity and Challenges

The hosts acknowledge that compiling such a list is inherently subjective. There are "no right answers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>, and different individuals will value different aspects of a player's career more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>. The "raw numbers they don't tell you the story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:17">[01:00:17]</a> without considering context, eras, and other variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:24">[01:00:24]</a>. The book aims to "show how many great batters there have been and how many different kinds of great batters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:20">[00:56:20]</a>, highlighting forgotten players and giving others their due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:30">[00:56:30]</a>.

Ultimately, the ranking process involves a deep dive into [[cricket_and_player_performances | cricket and player performances]], considering not just statistics but also context, influence, and the sheer impact a player had on their era. The result is a nuanced, albeit subjective, ranking of Test cricket's greatest batters.

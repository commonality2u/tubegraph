England began their day with "precocious Vibes" but quickly lost momentum, conceding a significant advantage to India, despite being over 200 runs behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>. Both Joe Root and Ben Duckett played shots described as horrendous, with Duckett's wicket being particularly ordinary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:15">[01:13:15]</a>.

## England's Early Struggles

England's day started with early wickets, including key players Joe Root and Ben Duckett. Root's shot was noted for "breaking the internet," while Duckett's dismissal was described as "absolutely horrendous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. These early losses allowed India to gain a significant advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.

## India's Bowling Performance

Despite Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja not bowling much, England targeted Kuldeep Yadav and Mohammed Siraj <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. However, Kuldeep and Siraj "completely held their own" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. Kuldeep bowled well, taking wickets even if some weren't from his best deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. Mohammed Siraj was particularly effective in "crushing the tail" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. India has been "absolutely exceptional" at crushing the tail in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

Siraj's economy rate dramatically improved from 5.4 on Day 2 to 2.7 on Day 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. England's strategy of going after the third and fourth bowlers aims to overwork the main bowlers, like Jasprit Bumrah, and force captain changes in rotations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. This strategy, however, can be risky if support bowlers take wickets, which happened on Day 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

All Indian bowlers ended the day with an economy rate around three, including Jadeja, who bowled four overs for 33 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. Siraj's wickets included a good ball to Ben Foakes and a Rahane-esque Yorker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. Siraj aimed to bowl more Yorkers, which are particularly effective against the tail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

## Analysis of Joe Root's Dismissal

Joe Root's "reverse scoop" shot, played 24 times prior, yielded 66 runs from 24 balls at a rate of 16 runs per over in Test cricket, making it his "worst attacking shot" based on average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>. He uses this shot as a weapon, especially against left-arm bowlers over the wicket or against defensive fields without a third man fielder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>.

Against Jasprit Bumrah, Root's execution was poor; he didn't get under the ball and was caught at slip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>. The angle Bumrah bowls from, coming from wide on the crease and delivering from an unusual position for a right-arm bowler, makes the reverse scoop a "tough shot to pull off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>. Historically, Mike Gatting's reverse sweep dismissal was also attributed to playing the wrong ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.

Root often uses this shot when he feels troubled outside off stump or when teams try to "dry him up," believing it's safer than nicking a straight blade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

## Impact of "Bazball" on Joe Root

Analysis comparing Joe Root's performance before, during his peak, and during "Bazball" suggests that Bazball is not "ruining" his batting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>.
*   **Before Bazball**: Root averaged 49.19, while other batters averaged 34.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>.
*   **Two-Year Peak**: Root averaged 52, with the rest of the top order averaging 31 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:19]</a>.
*   **During Bazball**: Root averages 51.5, which is "pretty much exactly what he was in the two years prior" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>. While the team averages more runs, Root's average has remained consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.

Joe Root's batting style naturally aligns with Bazball, as he is a "brilliant strike rotator" and adept at changing bowlers' lengths, particularly against spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>.

## England's Third Innings Challenges

Historically, England has struggled to be batted out of the game in the third innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. Only New Zealand (483) and Ireland (significant lead) have scored more than 326 against England in completed third innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. Even when teams like Australia have had opportunities to close out matches, England's aggressive style has kept them in the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.

England believes they can chase 500 in a Test match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>. They have committed to the "Bazball" approach, making it difficult for them to block for a draw unless the pitch significantly deteriorates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.

## Key Batting Performances for India

### Yashasvi Jaiswal
[[Crucial Moments and Player Tactics in IND vs ENG | Yashasvi Jaiswal]]'s innings showcased his ability to shift gears, attacking early (strike rate of 122 in his first 48 balls) and then playing more defensively (strike rate of 57 in his next 85 balls) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. He is effective against spin, particularly off-spin, and can adapt his play based on the match situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. Jaiswal experienced a back issue during his innings, similar to problems faced by other batters like Michael Clarke and Michael Atherton, often linked to extensive batting and fielding at slips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.

### Shubman Gill
Shubman Gill averages 26 in the first innings but 42 in the second innings of Test matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. His fourth innings average is also good for someone averaging around 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. A significant portion of his runs come in the third innings, which professional cricketers consider a "least amount of pressure" situation due to comfortable leads, imminent declarations, or dead games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. While Gill batted "really really well" on Day 3, this pattern is something to watch for in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. Gill possesses "Test level batting talent" and can look like he's batting "with skates on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

## Dhruv Jurel's Wicketkeeping

Dhruv Jurel, despite being teammates with Kuldeep Yadav in the Ranji Trophy, has limited experience keeping to him in professional cricket, around 25 overs before this match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>. On Day 3, Jurel struggled to pick Kuldeep's wrong 'un, with several balls going over the stumps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. His keeping appeared "divy" at the stumps, and he sometimes looked at the ball like a batter, indicating he's not a specialist wicketkeeper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. This could become more challenging as the game progresses and the pitch deteriorates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

## Pitch Conditions

The pitch was initially expected to be tough for batting by Day 3, but it remained "still a pretty good surface to bat on" for the most part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>. While some balls misbehaved, it hasn't caused significant problems for batters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. Spinners like Kuldeep and Rehan Ahmed, and even Tom Hartley, found some bounce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. The pitch is currently trustworthy, but that may change on Day 4 or 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

## England's Overall Strategy ("Bazball" Revisited)

England's "Bazball" strategy incorporates aggressive play and aims to target the fourth and fifth bowlers to overwork the main bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. This approach led to England believing they were "back in this game" at stumps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. While there are "lots of very good parts of Bazball tactically," including positivity and selection, some aspects, like less fielding practice or an "it doesn't matter if we lose" mentality, are questionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>.

The tactical element of scoring fast in Test cricket, as seen with players like Trumper, Jessop, Bradman, Greenidge, and Lloyd, puts immense pressure on the opposition by disrupting their plans and not allowing breaks for strategic adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. England's approach often weaponizes both batting and bowling by attacking from both sides of the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>.

## Bowling Techniques Explained

*   **Cross-seam ball**: The seam runs parallel to the crease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>. It's less likely to land on the seam, aiming for inconsistent bounce rather than sideways movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.
*   **Wobble ball**: The seam is held at a slight angle, with fingers run around the back to make it oscillate upon landing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. It always lands on the seam and aims for unpredictable lateral movement (left, right, or straight through) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. Batters get "absolutely no clues" about the ball's direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.

## India's Spin Depth and Injuries

Concerns were raised about India's spin options beyond Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. While players like Axar Patel and Washington Sundar are talented, Axar lacks the overseas experience of Jadeja, and it takes years for spinners to develop to that level, as seen with Jadeja and Ashwin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. A simultaneous retirement of Ashwin and Jadeja would likely lead to a "regression" for India's spin attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.

Ravindra Jadeja's limited bowling on Day 3 was attributed to an injury, as he was only "90% fit" coming into the test and not moving as well as before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. Joe Root's struggles against Jasprit Bumrah in India are notable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.

The injury to Jack Leach is a "massive" blow for England, as there's no direct replacement for his holding bowler role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>. This has forced Tom Hartley or Joe Root into that role, neither of whom is suited for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>. Joe Root's bowling consistency is not at a frontline level, impacting England's ability to maintain pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.

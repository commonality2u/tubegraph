Mayank Yadav is a young Indian fast bowler who quickly gained widespread attention despite having bowled only 73 deliveries in his early career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. This immediate obsession was fueled by his raw pace, with the speedometer showing speeds of 155-156 km/h, a rare sight in Indian cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.

## Early Life and Development

Yadav hails from Sonet Club in Delhi, a renowned academy that has produced numerous Indian international cricketers, including Ashish Nehra, Shikhar Dhawan, Rishabh Pant, Akash Chopra, and Manoj Prabhakar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. He joined Sonet at around 13 or 14 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. According to his current coach at Sonet, he displayed "zip" from the moment he started bowling, indicating his natural pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

Despite his early talent, Yadav was not widely known in his teenage years. This could be attributed to injuries, as he has a history of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. Additionally, for a fast bowler's name to become prominent, they generally need to be consistently picking wickets, which he may not have been doing prolifically in junior cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. He missed the Under-19 World Cup selection, which in India is a significant pathway for prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.

## IPL Debut and Impact

Mayank Yadav was picked up by Lucknow Super Giants for his base price of around 20 lakh (approximately $20,000-$25,000 USD) in 2022, indicating he wasn't initially seen as a major prospect by all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>. He did not play in the IPL during the 2022 season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>. Lucknow's head coach, Justin Langer, had seen him last year and was impressed, and Yadav might have debuted then if not for a hamstring injury during practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.

His IPL debut came on March 30th against Punjab Kings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>. He was brought in to bowl in the 10th over, with Shikhar Dhawan and Jonny Bairstow having put on an 88-run opening partnership chasing 200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>. Although his first over went for 10 runs, batters were visibly rushed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>. He finished that game with figures of 3 for 27, completely changing the match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>. International cricketers like Jonny Bairstow, who are accustomed to facing fast bowlers, were visibly rushed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>. All his wickets in that match came from shorter balls, where batters attempted pull shots but were too rushed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>.

In his next game against Royal Challengers Bangalore, he bowled at speeds of 156.7 km/h and took 3 wickets for 14 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a>. His wickets included Anuj Rawat, Glenn Maxwell, and Cameron Green, all international-level players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>. The impact of his pace was evident:
*   Faf du Plessis's footwork changed, as he backed away slightly on a full and straight ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>.
*   [[Glenn Maxwell]]'s usually fast hands looked slow when playing a pull shot off a short ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>.
*   Anuj Rawat, a left-hander, noticeably walked across his stumps and shortened his backlift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>.
*   Batters were consistently hitting his deliveries much further back on the stumps compared to other bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>.
*   Cameron Green, who grew up on fast wickets in Perth, was completely bowled after his feet "went in the toilet," unable to cope with the pace, making him look like an associate-level batter or tail-ender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>.

He became the first Indian player to win 'Man of the Match' awards in his first two IPL games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:04:00">[15:04:00]</a>.

## Bowling Style and Action

Mayank Yadav's unique "skidy action" appears to rush onto the batter, making him difficult to pick up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:20:00">[13:20:00]</a>. Unlike bowlers who "bang it in" and lose pace after the bounce, his deliveries seem to "skid" off the pitch, maintaining their speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:51:00">[14:51:00]</a>. This characteristic has been compared to bowlers like Malcolm Marshall and Dale Steyn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:00">[14:43:00]</a>.

## Injury Concerns and Management

A significant challenge for Mayank Yadav's career has been his susceptibility to injuries. In the span of just 73 balls across two IPL seasons, he has sustained a lower side strain, an abdominal strain, and a hamstring strain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:31:00">[16:31:00]</a>. After his impactful IPL debut, he left a game with an abdominal strain after bowling just one over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:14:00">[16:14:00]</a>. He returned later but walked off with a lower side strain after taking a wicket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26:00">[16:26:00]</a>. Currently, he is at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bangalore recovering and has not been picked for Delhi's Duleep Trophy squads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.

His physical development is seen as incomplete, similar to Shamar Joseph, who also faces injury issues despite being very young <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:29:00">[17:29:00]</a>. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) recognizes him as a "precious commodity" and is focused on ensuring he can stay on the park <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:20:00">[18:20:00]</a>. There is an emphasis on not rushing him and allowing his body to strengthen, even if it takes one or two more years, drawing parallels with Pat Cummins's career management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:30:00">[18:30:00]</a>. The BCCI has also started giving out fast bowling contracts to build a pool of bowlers and manage them better, especially with current stalwarts like Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami nearing the end of their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:52:00">[21:52:00]</a>.

## Career Statistics and [[Future prospects for Mayank Yadav | Future Prospects]]

Mayank Yadav's career statistics are limited due to his injuries and lack of play:
*   **First-Class Cricket**: One game, 2 wickets at an average of 23, bowling 104 balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:53:00">[16:53:00]</a>.
*   **List A Cricket**: 822 balls bowled, 34 wickets at an average of 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:59:00">[16:59:00]</a>.
*   **T20 Cricket**: Bowling average of 14, but only 8,000 balls bowled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:15:00">[17:15:00]</a>.

His limited-overs statistics are promising, suggesting he could be a significant asset for India if he maintains fitness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:58:00">[20:58:00]</a>. However, it's too early to assess his potential in red-ball cricket, as he needs to demonstrate accuracy and endurance consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:40:00">[20:40:00]</a>.

There is significant hype surrounding Yadav, given he is arguably the fastest bowler ever from India, based on speedometer readings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:37:00">[19:37:00]</a>. While India is not starved for fast bowling talent currently (with Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, and Mohammed Shami), Yadav offers a distinct "red hot heat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:43:00">[24:43:00]</a>. Indian fans are eager to believe in a genuine tearaway bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:35:00">[24:35:00]</a>. The optimism for his future is higher now compared to 15 years ago, as Indian cricket has shown improved management of fast bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:01:00">[25:01:00]</a>. The focus is on letting him recover and manage his workload, rather than rushing him into international cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:48:00">[21:48:00]</a>. His participation in future international tournaments like the Champions Trophy or T20 World Cup will depend on his ability to play domestic cricket for India, rather than being picked directly from the IPL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:04:00">[23:04:00]</a>.

Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) has adopted a "boom or bust" strategy that has led to periods of both immense success and struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:15">[00:53:15]</a>. This approach, which involves pushing the foot down on the accelerator for consistent aggression, inherently means the team will experience collapses and lose a string of games at times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>.

## Current Challenges and Concerns
The primary issue with SRH's current strategy is the lack of a contingency plan when circumstances turn unfavorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:55">[00:53:55]</a>. Without a backup plan, the strategy remains inherently "boom or bust" with no middle ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:10">[00:54:10]</a>. While the team was strong last year, their current roster is not perceived to be as good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:28">[00:53:28]</a>.

## Proposed Mitigation Strategy
To mitigate the inherent risks, it is suggested that SRH incorporate one or two players in their batting lineup who can play a "sheet anchor" role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:18">[00:54:18]</a>. This means having players who can:
*   Consolidate an innings after a strong start, allowing others to continue attacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:09">[00:55:09]</a>.
*   Stabilize the innings and build partnerships following a collapse, such as losing three quick wickets in the powerplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:44">[00:54:44]</a>.

This adjustment would provide a necessary "mitigation process" for when things go wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:38">[00:54:38]</a>.

## Team Composition and Performance
Last year, SRH's success was largely attributed to their batting, as they consistently outscored opponents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. Despite high-scoring encounters where opposition teams often chased down large totals, SRH secured wins primarily due to their formidable batting lineup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:08">[00:58:08]</a>. Their bowling attack, even with additions like Muhammad Shami and Adam Zampa (who is now out of the side), has not consistently taken wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:45">[00:56:45]</a>. This season, they aimed for a more "round" team but the bowlers haven't performed as expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>.

### Impact Player Rule Influence
The [[ipl_2025_strategy_and_player_performance | Impact Player Rule]] is seen as a contributing factor to teams like SRH embracing an aggressive "hammer and tongs" approach, where players maximize every opportunity regardless of the opponent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:20">[00:31:20]</a>. This rule encourages an all-out attacking mindset, which SRH has fully embraced to win the championship solely on the back of their batting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:50">[00:58:50]</a>. This approach is estimated to have a 40% chance of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>.

While the "boom or bust" strategy makes for exciting cricket, the lack of a contingency plan means SRH will continue to experience games where they look like a "gazillion bucks" and others where they look like "poppers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:29">[00:55:29]</a>.

A notable story from a first-class cricket game between [[mumbai_indians_performance_analysis | Mumbai]] and Karnataka highlights an extraordinary act by Sunil Gavaskar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Match Context

The match was a knockout game, specifically a final, played on a "ranked turner" pitch that was heavily turning by the fourth or fifth day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Despite the dramatic individual performance, [[mumbai_indians_performance_analysis | Mumbai]] had already lost the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Karnataka's objective was to win outright against [[mumbai_indians_performance_analysis | Mumbai]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Sunil Gavaskar's Remarkable Stance

During the game, Sunil Gavaskar witnessed batters struggling against Raghuram Bhat, a renowned left-arm spinner for Karnataka who had also played one Test match for India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Gavaskar reportedly approached his teammates, suggesting they needed to "play with the spin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

He then took the unusual step of demonstrating how "easy it is" to bat on such a pitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

### Batting Ambidextrously

Gavaskar went to the crease and batted six overs against Raghuram Bhat left-handed on the turning pitch, managing to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The full story, which is detailed in a book, indicates he moved himself down the batting order and initially sent in another left-hander who did not last long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

Even more remarkably, Gavaskar batted left-handed at one end of the pitch and then switched to batting right-handed at the other end against an off-spinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This ambidextrous display is considered highly unusual and noteworthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

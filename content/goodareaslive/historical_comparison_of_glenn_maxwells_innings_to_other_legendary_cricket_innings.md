Glenn Maxwell's performance against Afghanistan in the ODI World Cup 2023 is considered one of the most extraordinary innings in cricket history, prompting extensive [[glenn_maxwells_remarkable_innings_against_afghanistan_in_the_odi_world_cup_2023 | comparisons]] to other legendary knocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. This analysis evaluates its place among the greatest one-day international (ODI) innings ever played <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

## The Context: A Herculean Effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>

Australia found itself in a dire situation against Afghanistan, with the scoreboard reading 91 for 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. From this precarious position, Glenn Maxwell embarked on a remarkable innings, battling not only the Afghan bowlers and fielders but also his own body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. He was physically compromised, reduced to "little more than like a niled elf that had been tossed in a fire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>, shriveling up and unable to run between the wickets effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>, moving like "Charlie Chaplin on 12 frames" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. Despite this, he continuously hit boundaries in "weird and wild ways" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>, employing shots like the paddle slap and reverse fafs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.

Maxwell's innings was primarily a solo effort, with captain Pat Cummins described as "the world's most overpaid cheerleader" at the other end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. Cummins contributed only 12 runs to their 179-run partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

### Statistical Significance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>

Maxwell's innings broke several records:
*   Most runs ever made by a team after losing seven wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>.
*   Highest score by a number six in ODI Cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>.
*   Highest score by an Australian in an ODI and at a World Cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>.
*   First double hundred by an Australian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>.
*   First double hundred when not opening the innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>.
*   First double hundred when chasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>.

## Historical [[comparison_of_cricket_legends | Comparisons]]

The question immediately arose: "Is this the best knock... ever?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a> The speaker acknowledges recency bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a> but still finds it difficult to place many innings above Maxwell's.

### World Cup Innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:23:00">[19:23:00]</a>

Several World Cup innings are brought into the [[comparison_of_historical_cricket_rivalries | comparison]]:

*   **Chris Gayle's 237 and AB de Villiers' 160+ (both against West Indies):** While incredible, the "degree of difficulty" for Maxwell due to his physical state sets his innings apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:32:00">[19:32:00]</a>.
*   **Finals Innings:** Clive Lloyd's innings in the first World Cup, Aravinda de Silva's century, Ben Stokes' 2019 knock, and Adam Gilchrist's innings in 2003 and 2007 finals are mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:01:00">[20:01:00]</a>. These innings were under immense pressure but were not made in situations of physical duress or with such a collapse in wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:30:00">[20:30:00]</a>. Aravinda's chase, for instance, was from a "comfortable position" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:43:00">[20:43:00]</a> and with a recognized batter like Arjuna Ranatunga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:54:00">[20:54:00]</a>, unlike Maxwell batting with the tail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:52:00">[20:52:00]</a>.
*   **Kapil Dev vs. Zimbabwe (1983 World Cup):** Kapil Dev's 175 runs from 17 for 5 is a strong contender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:30:00">[21:30:00]</a>. However, it was a first-innings score, allowing for a different tactical approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:59:00">[21:59:00]</a>, and against a team not as strong as Afghanistan's bowling unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:50:00">[21:50:00]</a>.
*   **Kevin O'Brien vs. England (2011 World Cup):** This innings by an associate nation is perhaps the "most surprising innings in world cricket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:10:00">[22:10:00]</a>. While O'Brien had some support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:28:00">[22:28:00]</a>, the "pound-for-pound" surprise element makes it a tough comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:10:00">[22:10:00]</a>.

### Other ODI Innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:05:00">[23:05:00]</a>

Beyond World Cups, other legendary ODI innings are considered:

*   **Sachin Tendulkar's 200:** Breaking the 200-run barrier was significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:18:00">[23:18:00]</a>.
*   **Sanath Jayasuriya's 189:** Made when his team was 16 for 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:40:00">[23:40:00]</a>.
*   **Herschelle Gibbs in the record run chase:** A "marvelous" innings in a high-scoring game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:54:00">[23:54:00]</a>.
*   **Viv Richards' 189:** Scored at a time when such a score was almost unfathomable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:17:00">[24:17:00]</a>. He came in at 11 for 2, fell to 102 for 7, and then 166 for 9, scoring 106 runs for the last wicket with Michael Holding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:30:00">[24:30:00]</a>. The key differences are Richards wasn't chasing and Maxwell struck quicker (though strike rates are generally higher now) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:06:00">[25:06:00]</a>.

## The Verdict on Maxwell's Innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:21:00">[25:21:00]</a>

The speaker concludes that Maxwell's innings surpasses most, if not all, of these other legendary performances, primarily due to:
*   The "historical" nature of the chase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:36:00">[25:36:00]</a>.
*   The number of wickets down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:41:00">[25:41:00]</a>.
*   The "one-sided partnership" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:41:00">[25:41:00]</a>.
*   The "physical toll" it took on him, forcing him to adapt his batting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:44:00">[25:44:00]</a>.

> "I don't want to call it the greatest innings in one day cricket history but I'm finding it hard to say that the others are better than it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:01:00">[26:01:00]</a>.

The top three are considered to be Viv Richards, Kevin O'Brien, and Glenn Maxwell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:09:00">[26:09:00]</a>.

## Maxwell's Career and World Cup Prowess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>

Maxwell's career has been described as "weird" because Australia often tried to "put a leash on something that... you can't actually train up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>. This approach was similar to how they handled [[historical_analysis_of_cricket_players_careers | Andrew Symonds]], who could have been an even better limited-overs player if "let off the hook" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>. T20 cricket, and his success overseas, allowed Maxwell to resist being "muzzled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>. Pat Cummins noted that "you don't tell him anything" to get the best out of him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:00">[10:34:00]</a>.

While Maxwell has his "failures," when he reaches this level, it is "almost unlike anything we have ever seen in cricket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:00">[10:38:00]</a>.

His World Cup statistics highlight his exceptional performance in the tournament:
*   He averages around 50 with a strike rate of 161 in World Cup Cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[14:26:00]</a>.
*   Even before this innings, his strike rate was "incredible" and he was an "outlier" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:06:00">[15:06:00]</a> among players with over 500 World Cup runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:03:00">[13:03:00]</a>.
*   He now has three ODI hundreds in World Cups, compared to only one outside of World Cups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:48:00">[16:48:00]</a>, demonstrating how he "raises his value" in major tournaments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:55:00">[16:55:00]</a>.

Comparisons with other powerful middle-order batters like David Miller and [[comparisons_with_other_cricket_prodigies | Jos Buttler]] show Maxwell's significantly higher strike rate in World Cups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:20:00">[13:20:00]</a>.

## Other Notable Aspects of the Match

While Maxwell's innings overshadowed everything, other elements contributed to the game's drama:
*   **Afghanistan's Bowling:** Naveen-ul-Haq and Omarzai delivered exceptional early spells, getting key wickets like Travis Head and Mitch Marsh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:36:00">[33:36:00]</a>.
*   **Ibrahim Zadran's Century:** He scored Afghanistan's first-ever World Cup century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:56:00">[40:56:00]</a>, a "classy innings" that put his side in a winning position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:32:00">[39:32:00]</a>.
*   **Afghanistan's Fielding:** Crucial dropped catches, including one that might have been Maxwell's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>, played a role in the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:44:00">[23:44:00]</a>.
*   **Australian Weakness Against Spin:** Despite early concerns, Australia has performed "pretty well against spin" in this World Cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:56:00">[31:56:00]</a>. Marcus Stoinis's decision to play a reverse sweep, a shot he rarely uses, was noted as a tactical misstep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:34:00">[27:34:00]</a>.
*   **Mitchell Starc's Non-Review:** An interesting moment occurred when Starc was given out but chose not to review, despite evidence suggesting the ball might have just flicked the stump, not his bat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:05:00">[30:05:00]</a>. This highlights that "batters do not always know when they hit it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:09:00">[31:09:00]</a>.

Ultimately, while the match had many compelling moments, it will be remembered almost exclusively for [[glenn_maxwells_remarkable_innings_against_afghanistan_in_the_odi_world_cup_2023 | Glenn Maxwell's remarkable innings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:37:00">[37:37:00]</a>.

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has introduced a new mentorship program aimed at addressing long-standing issues within the country's cricket system, particularly a perceived lack of [[professionalism_in_cricket | professionalism]] and inconsistent results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Shoaib Malik, who recently joined the PCB as a mentor for a domestic team, provides insights into this new initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## A New Approach to Mentorship
The role of mentors in Pakistan cricket is distinct from typical franchise cricket mentorship roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. Unlike franchise mentors who might primarily give inspiring speeches from the bench <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>, these PCB mentors are engaged in a comprehensive, year-round job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

### Contract and Commitment
Mentors are on a three-year contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a> and are expected to dedicate 240 days a year to their role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This includes being present during Champions Cup tournaments at the grounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a> and spending at least six days a month at high-performance centers when tournaments are not active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>. The commitment is considered a "24/7 job" for the professional athletes they are working with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

### Mentor Background and Authority
Five mentors have been hired, and four of them — Younis Khan, Misbah-ul-Haq, Shoaib Malik, and Sarfaraz Ahmed — have captained the Pakistan cricket team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. They have been given significant authority, including the power to select their own staff, which comprises spin bowling coaches, fast bowling coaches, physios, trainers, and head coaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

## Core Responsibilities and [[professionalism_and_player_development_in_pakistan | Player Development]]
The mentors' primary responsibility is to groom players and instill [[professionalism_in_cricket | professionalism]], providing them with the best facilities to improve both their skills and overall approach to the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

Key tasks include:
*   **Comprehensive Grooming**: Beyond just improving skill, mentors guide players on recovery from games, managing back-to-back matches, and maintaining consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   **Physical and Mental Conditioning**: This involves advising on diet plans, nutritionist plans, and overall training schedules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. The aim is to ensure players' bodies respond optimally for consistent performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   **Instilling Discipline**: Mentors emphasize that talent alone is insufficient for consistency; a disciplined life is crucial for a consistent athlete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   **Working with Various Teams**: The scope extends beyond the initially selected 30-35 players to include women's U19 and men's U19 teams, focusing on long-term [[player_development_in_pakistan | player development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

## Addressing Structural Issues and Continuity
The PCB's frequent changes in leadership and domestic [[structure_and_governance_of_pakistan_cricket | structures]] have historically hampered consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>. The new system aims to combat this by:
*   **Champion Tournaments**: These tournaments are designed to bridge the skill and [[professionalism_in_cricket | professionalism]] gap between domestic and national cricketers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
*   **Reduced Domestic Cricket Workload**: Recognizing the need for rest and time for personal development, the PCB plans to reduce the number of domestic tournaments from next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>. This provides players with essential recovery time and opportunities for off-field improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.
*   **Clarity and Communication**: Mentors emphasize the need for clear communication and continuity in plans for at least a few years to see results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>.
*   **Reporting Structure**: Mentors report to a newly hired director at the PCB, providing a clear point of contact for operational needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>. The chairman also maintains direct access and communication with players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.

## Player Selection and Development Pathways
The new system seeks to shift player selection emphasis from primarily T20 cricket to longer formats like four-day and one-day cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>. This is because longer formats expose players to diverse game situations (favorable, even, and momentum against) that better prepare them for higher-level competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>.

### Role of International Experience and NOCs
Shoaib Malik's own career highlighted the benefits of playing in various leagues worldwide for professional development, including learning life skills like doing laundry and interacting with different cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:39">[00:28:39]</a>. The PCB is working to balance player earnings and development in international leagues with national commitments and workload management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>. The aim is for greater clarity regarding NOCs (No Objection Certificates) for players to participate in foreign leagues during free windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>.

### Strategic Player Rotation
Malik has suggested to head coach Gary Kirsten that when touring stronger teams (like Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, England, India), Pakistan should field its best team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a>. However, when playing against relatively smaller sides or in home series, a mix of senior and newcomer players should be utilized to provide international exposure and manage the workload of key players, especially fast bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:08">[00:42:08]</a>.

## Babar Azam's Case Study
Shoaib Malik discussed his coaching interaction with Babar Azam, a top performer who consistently scores runs globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>. Malik offered specific tactical advice:
*   **Stance against Spin**: Suggested changing his guard from middle stump to leg stump against spinners. This helps eliminate the leg-before-wicket (LBW) element and allows for straighter shots against left-arm spinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:36">[00:43:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:08">[00:44:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:10">[00:46:10]</a>.
*   **Back Leg Movement against Pace**: Advised on improving back leg movement when playing off the back foot against bowlers exceeding 140 km/h, as he was previously trying to manage everything on the front foot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:35">[00:44:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:58">[00:44:58]</a>.

Malik emphasizes that the credit for implementing these changes belongs to Babar Azam himself, as he practiced and adapted them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. This highlights the continuous learning process even for established professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:27">[00:47:27]</a>. Following his resignation from white-ball captaincy, there's an expectation that Babar Azam, now free of additional pressure, will be able to focus solely on his batting and consistently win games for Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:54">[00:48:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>.

## Conclusion
The mentor program represents a significant shift in [[pakistans_cricket_strategy_and_performance_issues | Pakistan's cricket strategy]], aiming to foster a culture of [[professionalism_in_cricket | professionalism]] and consistency from the grassroots to the national level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">[00:37:42]</a>. By empowering experienced cricketers in key developmental roles and implementing clear structures, the PCB hopes to bring sustained success to Pakistan cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:02">[00:38:02]</a>.

The rivalry between the [[comparative_analysis_of_india_and_pakistan_cricket_teams | cricket teams of India and Pakistan]] is a significant fixture in the sport, particularly in ODI World Cups. As of a recent match discussed, India holds an 8-0 unbeaten streak against Pakistan in these tournaments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The matches are highly anticipated and often become a "mother of all games" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:27">[00:34:27]</a>, with tournament organizers often ensuring they play each other at least once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

## Early World Cups (Pre-1992): A Missed Fixture

Surprisingly, despite the hype, the first four editions of the ODI World Cup did not feature an India versus Pakistan game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This absence was partly due to the tournament's early organization by England and the ICC, who may not have prioritized such a fixture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Even in the 1987 World Cup, co-hosted by India and Pakistan, the teams did not play each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This period was before the era of "rigging the contest" for commercial success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, with less focus on the financial potential of such a game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

During this early period, Pakistan was generally considered the superior limited-overs side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. India had a difficult 1979 World Cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>, though they famously won the 1983 tournament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Pakistan had more players involved in Kerry Packer's series and possibly more County players, contributing to their greater professionalism in one-day cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Even though India won the 1983 World Cup, Pakistan was still seen as the overall better one-day team up until the 1999 World Cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

## The 1990s Era: Emerging Rivalry and Missed Opportunities

The 1992 and 1999 World Cups represented two of Pakistan's most successful campaigns, winning in 1992 and reaching the final in 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Despite this success and being generally superior to India in those tournaments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>, Pakistan failed to chase modest totals against India in both tournaments: 217 in Sydney (1992) and 228 in Old Trafford (1999) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. These are seen as "two wins that really got away" for Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

A [[key_matches_between_india_and_pakistan_in_world_cup_history | key match]] from this era was the 1996 World Cup Quarterfinal in Bengaluru <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. India posted a very strong total of 287 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>, which was comparable to 350-360 in contemporary cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. Pakistan got off to a blistering start, scoring 84 for no loss in 10 overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. However, a turning point occurred when Aamir Sohail was dismissed by Venkatesh Prasad after an on-field altercation, a "terrible shot" that halted Pakistan's momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. Venkatesh Prasad, surprisingly, became a legend in India-Pakistan World Cup cricket, also taking a five-wicket haul in 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

## A Change of Guard (2000s Onwards)

The 2003 World Cup marked a significant shift in the balance of power between the two teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. Prior to this, Pakistan was the superior limited-overs side in World Cup cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. From 2000 onwards, the [[analysis_of_indias_cricket_teams_performance_and_dominance | Indian batting lineup]] began to dominate, while Pakistan's batting started to decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. Key Pakistani players like Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis were past their prime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>, and Inzamam-ul-Haq had a poor tournament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

India's victory in the 2003 encounter, catalyzed by Sachin Tendulkar's impactful 98, including a famous six over third man off Shoaib Akhtar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>, was seen as a moment that "catapulted them towards the success that they were going to achieve in years to come" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. India's team under Sourav Ganguly started to lay the "template of modern day India" in terms of confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

A significant factor in Pakistan's decline was the decrease in the number of all-rounders in their team compared to their strong 1990s side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>, which was once their "sauce" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. By 2003, they were a "shadow of the team they once used to be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

The 2007 World Cup saw neither India nor Pakistan play each other in the main stages, as both were knocked out early by lower-ranked teams (Pakistan by Ireland, India by Bangladesh) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

## Modern Era and the Impact of Reduced Bilateral Cricket

The 2011 Mohali semi-final was the "most high-profile ODI World Cup game" between the two teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. India was playing at home, and Sachin Tendulkar was chasing a World Cup victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. Despite Pakistan reaching the semi-final after issues with spot-fixing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>, they famously dropped Sachin Tendulkar four times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. Wahab Riaz had a standout performance, taking a five-wicket haul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>. Pakistan ultimately failed to chase 260 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>, leading to a "real Heartbreaker" for their fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>.

There is a debate over whether Pakistan's losses are due to nerves and pressure, particularly as they have lost six of their eight World Cup encounters while chasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>. However, it's also argued that the fundamental difference lies in team composition: India is predominantly a batting team, and Pakistan is a bowling team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>. India's batting lineup has been superior since 2000, allowing them to put up decent totals that Pakistan's less proficient batting often struggles to chase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.

The dynamic of the rivalry has also been influenced by the cessation of bilateral series between the two nations after 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>. This makes World Cup encounters grander, almost "grand occasions" with immense hype and festivities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>.

Despite the ODI World Cup record, Pakistan has achieved success against India in other formats. In the [[t20_cricket_evolution | 2007 T20 World Cup]], Misbah-ul-Haq's innings made it a memorable encounter, although India prevailed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>. Pakistan also broke their World Cup hoodoo against India by winning the 2021 T20 World Cup while chasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>. In the [[key_matches_between_india_and_pakistan_in_world_cup_history | 2017 Champions Trophy]], Pakistan recovered from a humiliating loss in the first game to beat India in the final <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>. Even in the 2022 T20 World Cup, Pakistan largely "bossed that game" until Virat Kohli played an "incredible innings" to nullify their strong bowling attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>. This suggests that often, it's a combination of "dumb luck" and India's batting prowess against Pakistan's bowling strength, rather than merely pressure or "choking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>.

The future of the ODI World Cup is uncertain, with discussions about it being scrapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>. If this happens, the unresolved 8-0 record would leave a lasting "negativity" and "PTSD" for Pakistani fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>, preventing them from ever seeing their team break the "hoodoo" in this specific format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>. The rivalry, fueled by nationalistic sentiment and political tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:55">[00:32:55]</a>, creates an intense emotional investment for fans on both sides of the border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:46]</a>.

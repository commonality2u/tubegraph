Rohit Sharma's performance in the Indian Premier League (IPL) has often been a topic of discussion due to a perceived disparity between his significant international success and his individual batting statistics in the league. While undoubtedly a very good IPL player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:50">[00:34:50]</a>, many feel he hasn't fully lived up to his batting potential within the tournament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a>.

## Comparison with International Career

In Test cricket, [[Rohit Sharmas Test Career and Performance Analysis | Rohit Sharma]] has been noted for smashing the ball and taking on turning wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:10">[00:36:10]</a>. He is credited with revolutionizing the One Day International (ODI) setup for India and playing a significant part in T20 international cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:18">[00:36:18]</a>. However, when he returns to the IPL, he often appears to revert to a "prodding" style of play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:26">[00:36:26]</a>. His IPL numbers do not consistently match his international performance, leading to questions about why his batting doesn't translate as effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:20">[00:37:20]</a>.

## Batting Position and Statistics

Curiously, [[Rohit Sharmas batting strategy and position in IPL | Rohit Sharma's]] best numbers in the IPL have come when batting at number four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:45">[00:36:45]</a>. As an opener, he averages around 27-28 runs with a strike rate of about 130, which is considered a "replacement level player" performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:45">[00:39:45]</a>. In contrast, batting at number four, he averages 34 with a strike rate of 131, which are regarded as "elite numbers" for a T20 middle-order batsman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>. This performance at number four spanned 69 games between 2011 and 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:29">[00:40:29]</a>.

Statistically, from 2017 to 2023, [[Rohit Sharmas performance for Mumbai Indians | Rohit Sharma]] has not averaged over 30 runs in any single IPL season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:23">[00:42:23]</a>. He has also never scored more than 600 runs in a season, with his best being 538 runs in 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:33">[00:42:33]</a>. In most years, he doesn't surpass 400 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:26">[00:43:26]</a>, despite playing on a relatively flat wicket in Mumbai with a strong team around him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:31">[00:43:31]</a>.

## Factors Influencing Performance

### Impact of Captaincy

One theory suggests that the [[impact_of_captaincy_on_rohit_sharmas_career_and_performance | impact of captaincy]] and subsequent non-captaincy roles might explain his varied performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a>. When a player has captained a side for many years within a specific ecosystem and then steps down, they may experience a period of "soul-searching" as they navigate their role without the mantle of leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:55">[00:37:55]</a>. This phenomenon has been observed in other cricketers like Virat Kohli within the Indian cricket ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>.

[[Rohit Sharmas performance as an opener | Rohit Sharma]] was captain of [[Rohit Sharmas performance for Mumbai Indians | Mumbai Indians]] from 2013, the year he achieved his best seasonal tally of 538 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:21">[00:44:21]</a>. After that, he was unable to replicate those numbers, possibly because his value as a captain to the franchise was greater than his individual batting contribution, and the team had sufficient depth to compensate for any dips in his personal scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">[00:44:27]</a>. Now, no longer captain, he is in a phase of figuring out how to perform purely as a batsman for Mumbai Indians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:47">[00:44:47]</a>.

### Batting Intent and Physicality

While it might appear that [[Rohit Sharmas batting strategy and position in IPL | Rohit Sharma]] is intentionally "prodding," it is believed to be more a mental struggle or soft dismissals rather than a lack of intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:25">[00:41:25]</a>. There's a hope that he will address his fitness, perhaps by taking six months away from cricket to return in top form and finish his career strongly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:52">[00:41:52]</a>. His current physical state, including being a "thick guy" with large thighs, might put more pressure on his knees, potentially impacting his agility and running between wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:56">[01:16:56]</a>.

## Conclusion

[[Rohit Sharmas impact and batting strategy | Rohit Sharma]] is acknowledged as a significant overall asset to his team, especially given his captaincy successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:48">[00:45:48]</a>. However, his individual batting legacy in the IPL doesn't quite align with his widely recognized talent and international achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>. There's a desire among fans to see "one glorious season" from him at the end of his career, where he performs at his absolute peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:06">[00:47:06]</a>, ensuring he leaves the game on a high, inspiring future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:29">[00:47:29]</a>.

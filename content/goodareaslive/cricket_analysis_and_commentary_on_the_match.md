This article provides an in-depth [[cricket_strategies_and_game_analysis | analysis]] of the recent Test match, focusing on key player performances, team strategies, and the evolving nature of Test cricket under the "Bazball" philosophy.

## Match Overview

England began the day with "precocious vibes," but quickly lost their advantage, giving up a significant lead to India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Key moments included Joe Root's internet-breaking shot and Ben Duckett's "absolutely horrendous" shot, which contributed to England losing their "spirit and vibes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Despite Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja not bowling much, England targeted Kuldeep Yadav and Mohammed Siraj, aiming to break them and force Jasprit Bumrah to bowl long spells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. However, Siraj and Kuldeep held their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Mohammed Siraj was particularly effective, "crushing the tail" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. India has been exceptional at dismissing the tail in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

England shifted from being "in front morally to behind in reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Dhruv Jurel's aggressive batting, hitting the ball so hard he might have "thrown his own book out," was a brief highlight for England before his wicket fell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. England's only hope seemed to be coaxing a third innings "pickle situation" out of India, or chasing a massive target, which they would consider "under par" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## Player Performance Analysis

### Joe Root's Controversial Shot

Joe Root's attacking shots in Test cricket show his pull shot averages 87 against seam bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. His reverse scoop, however, is statistically his "worst attacking shot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. While modern cricketers play different shots, it's about choosing the right time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Root has played the reverse scoop 24 times, scoring 16 runs per over, equating to 66 runs from 24 balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. He uses it as a weapon against defensive fields or when left-arm bowlers bowl wide outside off stump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

When facing Jasprit Bumrah, Root's reverse scoop was played to a ball that was wide and tight, coming from a wide angle due to Bumrah's delivery stride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. The ball's angle makes it harder to fully extend arms and increases the risk of LBW <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. Root aimed to hit the ball in the air, but didn't get under it, leading to a "bad execution" and an unlikely catch at slip by Dhruv Jurel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. This specific shot choice was against the "right bowler" due to Bumrah's unique angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

#### Is Bazball Ruining Joe Root?
Before "Bazball," Root averaged 49.19, while other batters averaged 34.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. During his two-year peak, he averaged 52, with other top batters averaging 31 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. In the "Bazball" era, Root's average is around 51.5, not significantly different from his previous performances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. He naturally possesses "Bazball-esque" skills like strike rotation and changing bowlers' lengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Modern cricketers approach the game very differently, as seen with Rohit Sharma's successful risks on day one compared to Root's unsuccessful one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

### Mohammed Siraj

Mohammed Siraj's economy rate improved drastically from 5.4 on day two to 2.7 on day three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. His bowling, along with Kuldeep Yadav's, played a significant role in India's performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>. All Indian bowlers ended up with an economy rate of around three, despite Ravindra Jadeja bowling four overs for 33 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. India's ability to field at least four capable bowlers allows them to rest main bowlers and use them when conditions are favorable, putting England at a disadvantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.

### Dhruv Jurel (Batting & Keeping)

Dhruv Jurel's innings showcased his ability to switch gears between attacking and defensive play, unlike purely aggressive players like Rishabh Pant or Quinton de Kock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. He is particularly good against off-spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. His scoring chart shows a preference for scoring square of the wicket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>. His injury was noted, which could be related to the physical demands of batting for long periods and fielding at slips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:56">[00:39:56]</a>.

As a wicket-keeper, Jurel had limited prior experience keeping to Kuldeep Yadav, only about 26 overs in his professional career before this match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>. He struggled to pick Kuldeep's wrong 'un, with three balls going over the stumps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>. There were instances where he looked more like a batter than a specialist wicket-keeper, not always having his hands in the right position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:45">[00:37:45]</a>.

### Shubman Gill

Shubman Gill averages 26 in first innings and 42 in second innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>. His fourth innings average is good for someone averaging around 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>. Many of his runs come in the third innings, which professional cricketers consider the innings with the "least amount of pressure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>. This often happens when the team is in a comfortable position, a declaration is imminent, or the game is already "dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>.

A fascinating field setting for Gill was observed, with a deep backward square and leg gully, resembling a "Wagner field" but with some fielders in or just outside the ring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a>. He played an "effortless pull shot" in response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>. Gill has "elite-level batting talent" but faces challenges as bowlers have "worked him out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:47">[01:03:47]</a>. He may have an issue with the ball coming back into him, which affects his leaving and potentially leads to edges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>.

## Bazball and England's Strategy

England's "Bazball" approach involves aggressively targeting the fourth and fifth bowlers to overwork the main bowlers and disrupt captaincy rotations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. This strategy aims to avoid facing all five bowlers at their best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. However, the risk is that if support bowlers take wickets, the team is in trouble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>.

Despite the aggressive nature, England's batting hasn't improved universally, and they continue to play "gamble shots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:21">[00:35:21]</a>. The philosophy emphasizes positivity, tactical selections, and using T20 skills in Test cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>. However, there's a "Kool-Aid side" that sometimes dismisses fielding practice or the importance of losing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:42">[00:41:42]</a>. While "Bazball" can be one-dimensional, it is an improvement over England's previous batting performances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:18">[00:41:18]</a>.

> "Bazball was the reason at stumps that we thought England were back in this game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>

England believes they can chase 500 in a Test match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a>, and would find it hard to block for a draw unless the pitch significantly deteriorates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. Scoring quickly in Test cricket, as seen with players like Trumper, Jessop, Bradman, Greenidge, and Lloyd, puts immense pressure on the opposition and limits their time to strategize during breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:04">[00:55:04]</a>.

> "Attacking on both sides of the ball" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:31">[00:49:31]</a> is a core tenet of "Bazball."

## Pitch Conditions

The pitch was initially expected to be tough for batting by day three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>. However, it remained a "pretty good surface to bat on" for the most part, showing occasional misbehavior but not causing significant problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:25">[00:28:25]</a>. There was some bounce for spinners, especially those who can generate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:59">[00:27:59]</a>. The pitch is currently trustworthy but might deteriorate on day five, potentially hindering India's ability to bat England out of the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>.

## Bowling Techniques: Wobble Ball vs. Cross-Seam

A **cross-seam ball** is bowled with the seam running parallel to the crease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:25">[00:43:25]</a>. The aim is for the ball to hit the seam, causing it to skid low or bounce up inconsistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>. It's less likely to land directly on the seam, reducing sideways movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:59">[00:49:59]</a>.

A **wobble ball** is delivered with the seam on a slight angle, with fingers run around the back to create a "wobbling" effect on impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:30">[00:43:30]</a>. It aims for the ball to hit the seam and deviate left, right, or go straight through, often reacting more violently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:58">[00:43:58]</a>. Unlike conventional seam bowling, there are no clues for the batter about which way it will move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:25">[00:44:25]</a>. A wobble ball always lands on the seam, but it doesn't always move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:18">[00:50:18]</a>.

Joe Root's role as a bowler was also mentioned; he is not considered a frontline bowler despite his occasional good balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:56">[01:08:56]</a>, as his ability to land the ball consistently on a length is lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:15">[01:09:15]</a>. The absence of Jack Leach due to injury was seen as a massive blow for England, as there's no direct replacement for his holding bowler role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:48">[01:04:48]</a>.

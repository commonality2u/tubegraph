The show is hosted by Bam Kazi, Estelle Vasudevan, and Jared Kimber, with Varun Alvaka serving as the game master <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Game Format

The initial episode features a knockout competition focused on the [[greatest_test_batters_knockout_competition | 64 greatest ODI batters of all time]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This list was compiled using "hours of countless hours of research, complex algorithms and a lot of Vibes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

### Rules of Play

The rules are straightforward:
*   The game master reads out a knockout fixture pairing two players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   Competitors have 10 seconds to write down which player they believe should be eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   The competitors enter the game completely unprepared, without knowledge of the draw or the players involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

### Player Ranking Methodology

Player statistics mentioned during the game, such as averages and strike rates, are stated to be "adjusted numbers" for present-day eras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.

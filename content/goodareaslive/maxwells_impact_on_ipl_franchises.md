Glenn Maxwell's tenure in the [[ipl_team_dynamics_and_challenges | Indian Premier League]] (IPL) has been characterized by significant financial investment from franchises, but a perceived lack of professional conduct and underperformance relative to his potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. His approach to the tournament has been described by some as if he "come for vacation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Perception and Professionalism

There is a long-standing personal issue between Maxwell and figures like Veru, similar to the dynamic between Shane Warne and Mitchell Starc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Maxwell is noted as "not the most liked individual in [[maxwells_reputation_in_indian_cricket | Indian cricket]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

Concerns about Maxwell's professionalism are not exclusive to India, having been a "big thing about him in Australia, too" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. The "absence of professionalism has been dire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, leading to conversations among cricket observers about his approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. While acknowledging his "incredible talent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, critics point to his consistent failure to perform to potential in the IPL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Financial Impact and Underperformance

Despite his talent, Maxwell is considered to have "pulled the rug over" the [[ipl_team_dynamics_and_challenges | Indian Premier League]] and its franchises for a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Over this period, he has been paid "more than a million dollars almost every year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a> by various franchises, without consistently delivering performances commensurate with his high earnings or potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. This has led to widespread [[criticism_of_glenn_maxwells_ipl_performance | criticism of Glenn Maxwell's IPL performance]] and a struggle for many to "fathom how a player like him based simply on potential" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a> continues to command such high fees without consistent returns.

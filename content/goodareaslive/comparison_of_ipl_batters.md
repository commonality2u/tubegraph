Episode three of "Good Areas Knockout" focuses on identifying the [[greatest_ipl_batters | greatest IPL batters]] through a knockout tournament format involving the top 64 players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The list of 64 batters was compiled based on specific [[discussion_of_ipl_batter_criteria | criteria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Selection Criteria for Top 64 Batters
The initial list of batters included:
*   A minimum filter of 1,000 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   Removal of players with an "impact" less than zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Impact is defined as how much a batter changes the predicted score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. For example, if the predicted score is 160 when a player walks in, and they hit a six, increasing the prediction to 163, their impact for that ball is +3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   Removal of players whose "true average" and "true strike rate" were negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

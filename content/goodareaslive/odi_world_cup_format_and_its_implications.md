The structure and execution of the ODI World Cup format have generated significant discussion, particularly concerning team performance, fan engagement, and the future of the format itself.

## Current Tournament Structure
The current ODI World Cup format is a round-robin, where every team plays every other team [39:07]. This means that hypothetically strong teams play against weaker ones, and vice-versa [39:00]. This structure can lead to a long tournament schedule, with England potentially having to play for another month despite poor performance due to the round-robin nature [41:18].

Historically, older World Cup games, particularly in England, were 60 or 55 overs, more than the current 50 overs, and even included lunch breaks [16:39].

## Criticisms and Perceived Problems
The round-robin format has been criticized for being "silly" [39:53] and potentially dragging on, especially when there are clear tiers of good and less good teams [56:03]. The current tournament has seen teams stringing together a couple of wins, leading to an overestimation of their strength against stronger opponents [38:08].

A significant implication of this format is that if a team like England were playing poorly, they would have been eliminated earlier in a different structure, allowing the tournament to move to its "more serious part" [39:29]. The format can also lead to situations where the top four teams are effectively decided well before the final games, causing the latter part of the tournament to "drag on" [56:32]. The International Cricket Council (ICC) is seen as having "no one to blame but themselves" for discussions about the [[debate_on_the_relevance_and_future_of_odi_cricket | death of ODI cricket]] during periods of non-competitive games [01:01:21].

## Team Performance within the Format

### England's Struggles
England's performance in the current World Cup has been particularly disappointing, leading to questions about their tactical approach and player form. Despite perception, England's wickets have not primarily fallen due to reckless attacking shots [32:26]. Instead, many dismissals have occurred while trying to "get off strike" or through defensive shots [20:14]. England averages 24 runs per wicket when rotating a shot, which is significantly lower than the expected 50 or 60 runs per wicket for top ODI teams [19:50]. They are also high on the list for wickets lost to defensive shots, indicating that they are not defending well despite adopting a more defensive posture than their perceived attacking style [20:48].

The team's struggles appear to stem from a widespread lack of form across both bowlers and batters [33:13]. Unlike past World Cups where England might have had strong players on the bench, the current squad lacks obvious replacements who could make a significant difference [34:39]. This situation has led to a "lack of energy" and "lack of answers" within the team, rather than a lack of "fight" [43:28].

England's strategic pivot towards T20 cricket, winning one of two T20 World Cups, has impacted their ODI performance [41:22]. This focus on T20 may have led to a belief that their established system would easily translate to ODIs, but this has proven incorrect as parts of the system crumbled or aged out [55:10]. The aging out of a "golden generation" of players who excelled in Pro40 cricket (a format that no longer exists) has contributed to the decline [49:47].

### Sri Lanka's Performance
Sri Lanka started the tournament with numerous injuries and a very young lineup, often bowling on batting-friendly wickets that were challenging for their bowlers [03:01]. Initially, they averaged 46.53 runs per wicket and were the most expensive team at 6.44 runs per over [02:49]. However, in their last two games, they showed significant improvement, averaging 24 runs and an economy of 4.92 [03:54]. This turnaround is partly attributed to bowling on pitches that offered more assistance and bringing in more experienced bowlers, such as Angelo Matthews, who surprisingly performed well despite not having bowled in an ODI since 2020 [04:02].

Sri Lanka's powerplay batting has been strong, second only to India in terms of pace [10:12]. Kusal Mendis's early performances on batting wickets contributed significantly [11:15]. Despite early wickets, players like Samarawickrama and Nissanka played positively in the powerplay [12:54].

### Other Teams
Australia has also seen a perceived resurgence after winning a couple of games, but this is sometimes viewed as an overestimation given the quality of their opponents (e.g., Netherlands) [38:00]. Similarly, New Zealand is noted as another example of a team that benefits from stringing together wins [38:02].

## Future of ODI Cricket
There's an ongoing [[debate_on_the_relevance_and_future_of_odi_cricket | debate on the relevance and future of ODI cricket]]. Some believe this could be the last 50-over World Cup [00:58:07]. This discussion originates not from the English media, but from broadcasters who, in the next cycle, considered shifting the most important World Cup from 50 overs to 20 overs [00:59:03]. Despite this, the current 50-over World Cup is projected to generate more revenue than any previous one, and even more than the 20-over World Cup [00:59:48].

The "World Cup isn't the issue" for the format; rather, it's the numerous other ODIs that struggle for relevance [01:00:11]. International cricket analysts admit to rarely following one-day cricket outside of tournament lead-ups due to its perceived lack of seriousness, player resting, and limited financial returns for some boards [01:00:24].

The ICC's chosen format, with potentially fixed top four teams early on, further contributes to this narrative of a dying format [01:01:14]. The format's failure to consistently deliver close games is also a concern, as close finishes were a primary reason for ODI cricket's invention [01:01:28]. Critics argue that there are "certainly better tournament options out there" [01:01:52], such as a double round-robin which could allow for marquee matchups like India playing Pakistan twice, a scenario that remarkably did not occur in some past World Cups [01:02:01].

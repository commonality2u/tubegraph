The match between India and Sri Lanka in the [[Cricket World Cup 2023 analysis | ODI World Cup 2023]] was described as "more wickets and runs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:47">[02:17:47]</a>, characterized by "absolute Carnage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:05">[02:02:05]</a> for Sri Lanka. India ended with a score of "350 odd" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:07">[02:05:07]</a>, after which "there was no Cricket, it was only violence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:04">[02:10:04]</a>.

## Indian Bowling Performance

The Indian pace attack was highlighted as "one of the best bowling attacks we've seen at a World Cup" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:37">[04:07:37]</a>, striking in a way never seen before from an Indian team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:25">[04:22:25]</a>. They were considered the "best Strike bowling team" ever seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:37">[04:37:37]</a>.

### Jasprit Bumrah's Masterclass

Jasprit Bumrah took a wicket with his first ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:02">[01:13:02]</a>. His first delivery was described as "ridiculous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:04">[03:32:04]</a> and "remarkable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:08">[04:43:08]</a>. The ball darted back "so much" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:06">[05:04:06]</a>, acting more like a left-arm finger spinner at serious heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:06">[05:11:06]</a>. Even Bumrah would have been surprised by the movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:08">[05:52:08]</a>. He created an extreme angle, delivering the ball from outside the wide line, which then straightened to hit the off stump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:07">[03:57:07]</a>. Despite only taking "one wicket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:07">[02:45:07]</a>, he was considered "unplayable early on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:02">[02:51:02]</a>.

### Mohammed Siraj's Impact

Mohammed Siraj took two wickets in his first over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:09">[01:17:09]</a>. His second wicket ball, dismissing Karunaratne, was moving fast and caught the batter unaware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:05">[06:37:05]</a>. Siraj, like Bumrah, created a "natural angle" with a big lean, bringing the ball back a long way despite being bowled very full <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:09">[07:18:09]</a>. This type of full, seaming ball is generally harder to achieve significant movement from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:09">[07:38:09]</a>. He demonstrates a "huge skill" in managing to land the ball in the same spot from different angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:19:07">[11:19:07]</a>. In the powerplay, Siraj averages 5.3 runs per wicket against Sri Lanka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

### Mohammed Shami's Wickets

Mohammed Shami was on a hat-trick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:04">[02:16:04]</a>. He took an early wicket with his first ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:05">[02:15:05]</a>. His bowling action is "much more traditional" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:48:06">[15:48:06]</a> compared to Siraj or Bumrah, with a dead straight arm and no angle created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:34:04">[15:34:04]</a>. Shami's wickets, particularly the one against Asalanka at 14 for 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:35:05">[14:35:05]</a>, were "proper collapse wicket[s]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48:07">[14:48:07]</a>, influenced by the pressure of the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:03">[15:00:03]</a>. He often gets a "million wickets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:33:04">[18:33:04]</a> even when other bowlers do the early damage. He demonstrated a ball similar to Siraj's to Karunaratne, pitching full and darting back to hit leg stump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:42:09">[18:42:09]</a>.

## Indian Batting Performance

India used the game as a "practice game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:01">[01:56:01]</a> to get runs for Gill and Iyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:04">[01:59:04]</a>.

### Virat Kohli

[[Cricket analysis and player performance in ODI World Cup 2023 | Virat Kohli]] has the most runs against spin without being dismissed in this [[Cricket World Cup 2023 analysis | World Cup]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>, with a strike rate of around 91 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:08">[02:06:08]</a>. His record against spin has been "startling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:09">[02:01:09]</a>. Since 2019, he had struggled more against spin, potentially due to changing his technique for Test Cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:04">[02:33:04]</a>. His only real struggle has been against left-arm Orthodox spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:03">[02:56:03]</a>.
Kohli has crossed 1000 runs in a calendar year for the eighth time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:08">[03:05:08]</a>, surpassing Sachin Tendulkar's seven times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:04">[03:15:04]</a>. His last 1000-run year before 2023 was in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:02">[02:54:02]</a>.

### Shubman Gill

Shubman Gill was the number two ranked ODI batter coming into the tournament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:04">[02:47:04]</a> and had the highest batting average in ODI Cricket history depending on minimum runs set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:06">[02:52:06]</a>. He missed the first few games due to dengue fever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:08">[02:58:08]</a> but was "outstanding" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:03">[03:16:03]</a> in this match. He displayed excellent touch, playing shots against quick bowlers that are usually seen against spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:02">[03:22:02]</a>.

### Shreyas Iyer

Shreyas Iyer is part of an Indian top order that is "ridiculous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:07">[03:37:07]</a>, with four current batters (Rohit, KL Rahul, Kohli, Gill) averaging over 45 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:07">[02:50:07]</a>. His presence on this list despite being a "victim" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:05">[03:35:05]</a> of sometimes being a scapegoat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:05">[03:41:05]</a>, shows the "impossible metric" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:03">[03:44:03]</a> they are judged against.

## Sri Lankan Bowling Performance

### Dilshan Madushanka

Madushanka was the "only positive thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:06">[03:06:06]</a> for Sri Lanka. He is the leading wicket-taker in the tournament with 18 wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:07">[03:39:07]</a>. He also has the second most wickets in the powerplay, potentially going past Jansen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:07">[03:45:07]</a>. His economy of 6.4 is "not great" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:07">[03:09:07]</a>, but he's been developing and getting better at taking wickets throughout the tournament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:04">[03:02:04]</a>. Madushanka took 5 for 80 in this match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:07">[03:07:07]</a>. His slow ball was surprisingly good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:09">[03:51:09]</a>, dismissing Kohli and Iyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:08">[03:59:08]</a>. He is expensive at the death (10 runs an over), but exceptional in the middle overs with an average of 25 from six wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:07">[03:23:07]</a>.

### Maheesh Theekshana

Maheesh Theekshana is struggling with injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:07">[03:27:07]</a> and not bowling as he used to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:05">[03:32:05]</a>. His bowling average in the previous cycle was 23.4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:06">[03:56:06]</a>, but it has "ballooned" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:05">[03:08:05]</a> in this tournament. He hasn't been "hammered" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:08">[03:29:08]</a> on economy throughout the tournament, but struggled more in this match by bowling "slightly offline" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:05">[03:37:05]</a>.

## Fielding Efficiency

Catch efficiency in the [[Cricket World Cup 2023 analysis | World Cup]] has shown fluctuations, with India's percentage initially in the 90s and Australia's at 50, both unrealistic long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:04">[03:07:04]</a>. [[India versus Pakistan ODI World Cup 2023 analysis | Pakistan]] surprisingly topped the catch efficiency list with 87% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:04">[03:23:04]</a>, while Sri Lanka was at 61% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:03">[03:59:03]</a>. However, not all catches are equal, with seam bowlers dropping approximately 60% of caught and bowled chances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:05">[03:27:05]</a>. India has created fewer chances (31) compared to New Zealand (56) or South Africa (63), indicating different bowling strategies (e.g., India attacking the stumps more) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:07">[03:31:07]</a>.

### Hardik Pandya's Return

When Hardik Pandya returns, he would likely replace a batter like Suryakumar Yadav <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:09">[04:00:09]</a>, leading to a "weak number eight position" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a> in the batting lineup. However, India's current bowling level could mitigate this risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:06">[04:13:06]</a>.

### Toss Decisions

There has been a trend of teams choosing the wrong thing after winning the toss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:02">[04:54:02]</a>. The best thing to do in this World Cup has often been to lose the toss and allow the opposition to make a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:01">[04:39:01]</a>. Bowling in the second innings during the powerplay (0-15 overs) has been a significant advantage in many grounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:08">[05:07:08]</a>. Batting first is generally easier in World Cups than chasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:05">[05:27:05]</a>.

### Wanindu Hasaranga's Absence

Wanindu Hasaranga's absence due to injury significantly impacted Sri Lanka's ability to take wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:02">[04:56:02]</a>. He is a "main strike bowler" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:09">[04:47:09]</a>, and without him, Sri Lanka has "struggled to take wickets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:06">[04:25:06]</a>, which is crucial for stopping teams from scoring over 300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:07">[04:55:07]</a>.

### Spinners vs. Pacers at the Death

Spinners are generally not preferred at the death because they can't bowl bouncers, don't bowl as fast, and offer less variety in deliveries like Yorkers or slower balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:05">[04:47:05]</a>. Pacers have the ability to bowl six different deliveries, which spinners cannot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:07">[04:05:07]</a>.

### Crowd Impact

While playing at home offers advantages like better umpiring decisions and increased player confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:08">[04:48:08]</a>, the crowd's energy in India is "absolutely crazy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:07">[04:02:07]</a>. However, exceptional bowling deliveries are the primary reason for team struggles, not crowd pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:04">[04:14:04]</a>.

### Sri Lanka Player Conditioning

Questions have been raised about Sri Lankan players' conditioning due to numerous injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:02">[04:53:02]</a>. While New Zealand, a fit team, also experienced many injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:04">[05:01:04]</a>, some Sri Lankan players, like Angelo Matthews and Maheesh Theekshana, have struggled with fitness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:07">[05:01:07]</a>.

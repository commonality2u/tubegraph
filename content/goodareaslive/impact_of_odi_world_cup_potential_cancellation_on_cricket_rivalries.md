The potential cancellation or diminishing importance of the [[debate_on_the_relevance_and_future_of_odi_cricket | ODI World Cup]] raises significant questions about the future of established cricket rivalries, particularly the intense one between India and Pakistan.

### India vs. Pakistan: An Unbroken Streak
As of October 2023, India maintains an unbeaten 8-0 record against Pakistan in [[cricket_world_cup_2023_analysis | ODI World Cups]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This streak is a major talking point whenever the two teams meet in an ODI World Cup.

#### Early World Cups: A Curious Absence
Surprisingly, India and Pakistan did not play each other in the first four editions of the [[odi_world_cup_format_and_its_implications | ODI World Cup]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This was partly due to England and the early ICC not foreseeing the immense commercial and financial success such a fixture would generate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. Even in the 1987 World Cup, co-hosted by India and Pakistan, they were not grouped to play each other, despite the round-robin format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This contrasts sharply with modern tournament scheduling, which often "rigs" fixtures to ensure an India-Pakistan encounter due to its immense broadcast value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

Historically, before 1992, Pakistan was considered the superior limited-overs side compared to India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Experts suggest Pakistan might have secured victories had they played India during that era, especially given India's weaker performances in 1975 and 1979 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Pakistan had more professional players and a stronger one-day team overall until the 1999 World Cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. Despite winning the 1992 World Cup and reaching the 1999 final, Pakistan failed to chase down relatively modest totals against India in both tournaments, which many fans consider missed opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

#### Key Encounters and the Shift in Dominance

*   **1996 World Cup Quarter-final (Bengaluru)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>: India scored 287, a significant total for the era, equivalent to 350-360 today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. Pakistan had a blistering start, reaching 84 for no loss in 10 overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. A turning point came when Pakistan's Aamer Sohail was dismissed shortly after verbally challenging Venkatesh Prasad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. Prasad, who also took a five-wicket haul in the 1999 World Cup match against Pakistan, became a legend in this rivalry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
*   **2003 World Cup (Centurion)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>: This match marked a significant "change of guard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. Sachin Tendulkar's 98, including a famous six over third man off Shoaib Akhtar, was pivotal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. India's victory here is seen as a catalyst that "catapulted them towards the success they were going to achieve in years to come" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. From 2000 onwards, Indian batting began to dominate, while Pakistan's batting, and particularly their all-rounders, saw a decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.
*   **2011 World Cup Semi-final (Mohali)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>: This was perhaps the most high-profile ODI World Cup game between the two teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. Pakistan reached the semi-final despite losing key players to spot-fixing the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>. Sachin Tendulkar was dropped four times and benefited from a DRS decision that controversially missed the leg stump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. Pakistan ultimately failed to chase 260, leading to accusations of match-fixing among some fans, despite recent fixing scandals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>.

### The "Pressure" and "Choking" Narrative
Out of India's eight ODI World Cup victories over Pakistan, six have come while Pakistan was chasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>. This has led to a persistent narrative that Pakistan struggles to perform under pressure in this fixture, particularly when chasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>.

This phenomenon is often compared to the "choking" narrative surrounding South Africa in World Cups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>. However, some argue that it's less about pressure and more about the inherent differences in team strengths, with India typically having a stronger batting lineup and Pakistan relying more on their bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.

Counter-examples challenging the "pressure" narrative include:
*   **2017 Champions Trophy final** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>: Pakistan, after being humiliated by India in the group stage, defeated them comprehensively in the final, proving they could perform under pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>.
*   **2021 T20 World Cup** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>: Pakistan broke the World Cup hoodoo against India, winning a crucial match while chasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>.
*   **2022 T20 World Cup** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>: Pakistan were in control of the game against India at the MCG until a remarkable innings by Virat Kohli turned the tide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>.

These instances suggest that while individual brilliance or tactical errors can influence outcomes, the "choking" explanation might be overly simplistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>.

### Impact of Bilateral Series Stoppage
The intensity of the India-Pakistan rivalry in global tournaments has been amplified by the cessation of bilateral series since 2008 (following the Mumbai attacks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>. With no regular direct competition, World Cup matches become "grand occasions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>, laden with heightened nationalistic fervor and media hype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:55">[00:32:55]</a>. Both countries contribute to making these matches "more than a game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>. While the hype can be overwhelming, it creates a unique spectacle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:17">[00:34:17]</a>. Interestingly, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is said to be interested in playing more against Pakistan for financial and energizing reasons, but political factors prevent it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a>.

### The Future of the Rivalry and ODI World Cups
The discussion around the potential cancellation of the [[odi_world_cup_format_and_its_implications | ODI World Cup]] would leave Pakistan fans with a lasting sense of "negativity" or "PTSD" regarding their winless streak against India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>. The hope of breaking the "hoodoo" would be removed, preventing fans from experiencing the potential triumph that could erase years of disappointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08">[00:31:08]</a>. The rivalry would be relegated to T20s, where Pakistan has already won against India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>, and therefore would not carry the same weight or unresolved historical baggage.

For fans, cricket fandom offers a vicarious emotional release, but persistent losses in high-stakes matches, especially with nationalistic undertones, can have psychological effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:44">[00:32:44]</a>. The India-Pakistan rivalry in the ODI World Cup embodies this, creating a unique cultural and emotional landscape for supporters on both sides of the border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:12">[00:34:12]</a>.

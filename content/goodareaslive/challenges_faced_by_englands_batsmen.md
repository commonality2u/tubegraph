England's batsmen have faced significant challenges, particularly in Test cricket against quality spin bowling in Asian conditions. While their openers have shown improved performances, the middle and lower order have struggled, leading to consistent batting collapses.

## General Batting Performance and Strategy

England's innings often self-destruct, with the team not batting for extended periods to start games, which India has learned to exploit by being patient and waiting for wickets to fall [[00:02:11]]. This is a consistent pattern, where they reach a strong position, such as 100 for one, only for the innings to fall apart, barely doubling that score [[00:13:41]]. This suggests an issue with their strategy or execution in longer innings.

The "Bazball" approach, while revolutionary and allowing freedom, might contribute to these collapses. While it has helped openers like Crawley and Duckett, who were previously inconsistent against spin, it appears to lack a "second part to their innings" where batsmen consolidate after getting set [[00:14:59]]. The mindset for players with "flawed" but "fast scoring skills" like Duckett and Crawley might need to change once they pass 30-40 runs, focusing on capitalizing rather than continuously taking high risks [[00:14:06]].

## Specific Batting Order Issues

[[analysis_of_englands_batting_order_issues | England's batting order issues]] are evident in their series batting averages:
*   Openers: Averaging 42 [[00:10:30]].
*   Number three: Averaging 33 [[00:10:33]].
*   Number four: Averaging 30 [[00:10:34]].
*   Number five: Averaging 21 [[00:10:37]].
*   Number six: Slightly up [[00:10:38]].
*   Numbers three to seven: Averaging 25 against India, a significant gap compared to their top order and India's middle order [[00:12:42]].

Historically, players batting at numbers four, five, and six (like Root, Bairstow, and Stokes) have been England's strength, but this has not materialized on the tour [[00:12:05]].

## Individual Batsmen Challenges

### Jonny Bairstow
Bairstow has shown moments of brilliant batting, but his aggressive approach sometimes leads to dismissals. He was "convinced that he had to get his 100 in 30 balls" [[00:01:54]]. He was dropped once trying to force a shot he didn't need to, and eventually got out trying to be aggressive against a wrong'un that beat him with a fine edge [[00:05:51], [00:05:57]]. He is seen as a "match winner" but has "so many holes in his game" and might be used "consistently wrong" in his career [[00:40:48]].

### Zak Crawley
Crawley's opening partnerships have been described as the "most grown-up basball opening partnership" seen for some time, despite playing almost exclusively with the outside or leading edge early on [[00:01:20], [00:01:02]]. He has managed to handle pressure, putting away bad balls and not attacking all out, which is an improvement from earlier in the series [[00:18:30]].

However, he still faces issues. He has shown improvements against spin, learning to come down the wicket to block or play good shots instead of always trying to smash the ball [[00:19:33], [00:19:35]]. Despite this, his bottom hand can take over, leading to bat paths from unusual angles when he tries to hit hard [[00:19:50]].

A significant concern for Crawley is his inability to convert starts into big scores. While he has clustered starts (scores between 30 and 70), indicating a good start to innings, he struggles to "capitalize on all of these starts" [[00:20:49]]. He lacks a "milking gene" and finds it difficult to "think his way through the Innings" once the new ball softens [[00:23:11], [00:23:54]]. His career statistics show a remarkable frequency of failing to pass 75, suggesting a "missing gear" in converting 30-70 scores into 100-150 runs [[00:21:09], [00:23:05]]. This indicates a lack of experience in building large innings, unlike most professional batters at his talent level who would have regularly scored 50s, 100s, or 150s in professional cricket before Test level [[00:22:20]].

### Ben Duckett
Duckett made a clear mistake getting out to a wide ball outside off stump, attempting to hit to the leg side [[00:04:51], [00:04:54]]. His dismissal involving a wide, full ball outside off stump, where he tried to drag it across, showed poor balance and a difficult shot choice for the situation [[00:06:28], [00:06:58]]. Like Crawley, he is a "flawed batter" with "fast scoring skills" who might benefit from a different mindset after getting a good start [[00:14:07]].

### Ollie Pope
Pope struggled against Kuldeep Yadav's wrong'un, attempting to come down the wicket but failing to realize the ball was turning the other way and being nowhere near the pitch [[00:04:56], [00:04:58]]. He also frequently uses his feet, possibly more than anyone in world cricket against spin and seam, a tendency that India's fielders note [[00:07:17], [00:07:07]].

### Ben Stokes
Stokes has an "inherent weakness in playing quality spin bowling" [[00:31:17]]. His batting average against India between 2014-2024 is 28, and in the current series, it is 21.8 across nine innings [[00:31:10]. He was dismissed after not picking a wrong'un from Kuldeep, despite having recognized it the previous over [[00:06:00], [00:06:05]].

Stokes's bat path, often coming from a wide position, creates a "built-in problem with the ball when it spins away from them" [[00:31:42], [00:31:47]]. His best shot against spin, the slog sweep, is a "high-risk shot" [[00:32:15]]. He struggles to come down the wicket without pre-determining his shot, often getting "trapped on the crease" or caught on the back foot against spinners in Asia [[00:32:34], [00:32:41]]. His average against spin is significantly lower in Asian conditions (e.g., UAE 15, Sri Lanka 28, West Indies/Bangladesh/Pakistan 35) compared to other places where spin struggles (e.g., England 42, South Africa 55, Australia 38, New Zealand 60) [[00:34:02]]. He is considered "slightly limited in some ways" as a batter, being an all-rounder, and is probably at his best against fast bowling [[00:34:48], [00:34:58]].

## Overall Impact
[[englands_struggles_and_tactical_errors_in_cricket | England's struggles and tactical errors in cricket]] with the bat are highlighted by their average number of overs batted in the first innings over the last two years: 73. This is significantly lower than most other Test teams, with only Afghanistan batting fewer overs (52) [[00:54:57]]. This short batting duration puts immense pressure on their bowlers, limiting their recovery time [[00:54:23]]. It also suggests a preference for chasing a target rather than setting one, as they average more in the second innings than the first, a rare characteristic among Test teams in the "Bazball era" [[00:55:10], [00:56:01]].

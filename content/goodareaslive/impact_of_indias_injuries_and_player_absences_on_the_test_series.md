The Test series has been significantly impacted by various factors, including player injuries and absences on the Indian side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. Despite these challenges, India has demonstrated resilience and competitive strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

## Key Absences and Their Effect
India has secured two consecutive victories in the series without some of their top bowlers and batters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:16">[01:28:16]</a>. In a recent Test match, India played with:
*   A legend looking after his mother (implied [[indias_performance_and_strategies_in_test_cricket | Virat Kohli]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:48">[01:33:48]</a>.
*   A key player bowling on one leg who still earned Man of the Match (implied [[indias_performance_and_strategies_in_test_cricket | Ravindra Jadeja]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:48">[01:33:48]</a>.
*   Approximately half of their first-choice top order missing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:48">[01:43:48]</a>.
*   [[indias_bowling_performance_in_the_test | Mohammed Shami]] also absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

Despite these significant setbacks, India won the game convincingly against England's "Bazball" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. This contrasts with earlier periods where teams visiting India often only managed a consolation victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.

## Managing Player Workload
Concerns exist regarding the workload of key spin bowlers like [[indias_performance_and_strategies_in_test_cricket | Ravichandran Ashwin]] and [[indias_performance_and_strategies_in_test_cricket | Ravindra Jadeja]], both of whom are aging and susceptible to injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. Regular bowling of 55-60 overs per game is considered unsustainable in modern cricket due to packed schedules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:53">[02:53:53]</a>.

The possibility of resting [[indias_performance_and_strategies_in_test_cricket | Ashwin]] and [[indias_performance_and_strategies_in_test_cricket | Jadeja]] in upcoming matches has been discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:39">[03:11:39]</a>. Even with potential absences or rests for [[indias_performance_and_strategies_in_test_cricket | Ashwin]], [[indias_performance_and_strategies_in_test_cricket | Jadeja]], and [[indias_bowling_performance_in_the_test | Jasprit Bumrah]], India's depth with players like Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, and Washington Sundar is considered strong enough to compete against England's bowling attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:09">[03:39:09]</a>.

## Series Dynamics
India's ability to perform strongly despite significant player absences underscores a new dynamic in their home Test series. The team has had to "work really hard and overcome some things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>, a change from periods when winning at home seemed relatively easy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. The choice of pitches has also evolved, moving away from "rank turners" that could create lottery-like conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>, towards more balanced surfaces that still favor India's strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. This approach allows the skill of the Indian bowlers to shine more, even on good pitches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

This article details the third episode of "Good Areas Knockout," focusing on the [[top_ipl_batter_tournaments | greatest IPL batters]] of all time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The hosts Baram Kazzy, Estelle Vasuan, Jared Kimber, and game master Varun Alvak, aim to identify the 'GOAT' IPL batter from an initial list of 64 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Selection Criteria for Greatest IPL Batters

The initial list of 64 batters was compiled based on specific criteria to ensure a fair [[discussion_of_ipl_batter_criteria | comparison of IPL batters]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>:
*   A minimum filter of 1,000 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   Exclusion of players with an "impact less than zero" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
    *   **Impact Definition**: Impact measures how much a batter changes the predicted score. For example, if the predicted score is 160 when a batter walks in, and a six increases it to 163, their impact on that ball is +3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   Removal of players whose "true average" and "true strike rate" are negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

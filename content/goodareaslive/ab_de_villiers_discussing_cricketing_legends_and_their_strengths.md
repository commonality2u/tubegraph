[[AB de Villiers]] provided insights into the strengths and characteristics of several prominent cricketers he has played with or against, often drawing [[comparisons of cricket legends | comparisons]] to his own experiences and development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

## Graham Smith
[[AB de Villiers]] describes [[Graham Smith]] as having "drive and desire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a> and being the "best leader" he ever played under <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. Smith was an "inspirational character" who would "face the entire world by himself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. His best performances came when he was "putting everything on the line" and "feeling like you've got something to lose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. He captained with a "very brave" approach, sometimes being controversial and always supporting his teammates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. Despite "flaws with his technique," he countered them with an "incredible mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.

## Mitchell Johnson
[[AB de Villiers]] noted that [[Mitchell Johnson]] would "always challenge me a bit vocally and physically," which [[AB de Villiers]] "loved from a very young age" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>. Johnson's aggressive approach would make [[AB de Villiers]] "wake up" and realize "the game is on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>. [[AB de Villiers]] felt "the boring bowlers were a lot more threatening" to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>. Johnson could bowl "up to 150k an hour" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>.

## Jacques Kallis
[[AB de Villiers]] highlighted [[Jacques Kallis]]'s "control, composure, calmness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. Kallis knew how to mentally prepare himself to "go and execute" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. According to [[AB de Villiers]], Kallis "honestly believed that a bowler couldn't get him out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. If Kallis got out, he would attribute it to the wicket, the umpire, or something else, "it was never ever him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. This self-belief meant he "bullshitted himself and said I've never made a mistake in my life, I'm the best" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.

## Hashim Amla
[[AB de Villiers]] described [[Hashim Amla]] as an "incredibly gifted guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>, but felt he "maybe lacked a little bit of that impactful side...that X-factor of being able to explode completely" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. Otherwise, Amla was "perfect in my eyes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. He had an "incredible mind," was "very calm, very composed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>, and turned his "technical struggles throughout his career" into "one of his strengths" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. Amla's technique was "really compact and solid" and he "played late" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. He was exceptional at driving on the up, even hitting balls that weren't full or drivable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. This was due to playing "very late" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. His "biggest strength was his mind" and his ability to repeat his routine every time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.

## Virat Kohli
[[AB de Villiers]] noted [[Virat Kohli]] as an "all-around great player" who "can play any situation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. His "fighting spirit" is his biggest strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. Kohli is at his best "when he feels like there's something to play for" and "when he's got a challenge and someone's in his way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. [[AB de Villiers]] would try to "get him a bit fired up" when batting with him, and advise opponents not to say "one word to Virat" or even "look at him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. This fighting spirit is similar to "Nadal, Djokovic in tennis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

## Chris Gayle
[[AB de Villiers]] highlighted [[Chris Gayle]]'s "intimidation factor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>, stating he "intimidated bowling attacks big time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. Gayle was a "big guy" who would stand at the crease, and "when he decided to go, it was really tough for the bowlers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. He possessed an "incredible eye," a "big wingspan" and "bat swing," allowing him to "reach any ball" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. Gayle intimidated others through his "skill and class and his consistency in hitting the big shots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

## Other Players and Influences

*   **Jos Buttler** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>: [[AB de Villiers]] noted Buttler's ability in T20 cricket to hold his position long and then generate power by getting his hands through the ball at the last second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:58:00">[14:58:00]</a>.
*   **Joe Root** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:42:00">[28:42:00]</a>: [[AB de Villiers]] observed that Root also accomplishes dropping balls short to slips after playing it late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:42:00">[28:42:00]</a>.
*   **Heinrich Klaasen** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:58:00">[19:58:00]</a>: During a domestic four-day game, [[AB de Villiers]] watched Klaasen bat and picked up a lot of things, reinforcing them into his own technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:01:00">[20:01:00]</a>.

He asserted that there is "no one better" as an ideal batter, as he learned from too many to mention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:01:00">[32:01:00]</a>.

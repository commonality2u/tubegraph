England's bowling strategy and performance during the series have shown mixed results, characterized by both wicket-taking moments and challenges in maintaining pressure.

## Overall Performance and Challenges
Initially, there were calls for Anderson to use the new ball, but Rohit Sharma quickly dispatched him into the stands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The team bowled "horrendously bad" at times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>, which gave India a "double start" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.

The English strategy with bowlers like Tom Hartley and Shoaib Bashier "hasn't quite worked the way they thought it would" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>. They seemed to anticipate "shootout wickets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. While their "best balls are wicket taking balls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>, their main issue is the "ability to keep pressure on" when the wicket is flat or when they should be on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>.

Despite these challenges, England has been "fantastic at manufacturing wickets" in the [[Englands cricket strategy under basball | Basball]] era, and this continued in the series, even if "it hasn't worked as well for them in other series" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:35">[00:52:35]</a>.

## Captaincy and Fielding Tactics
Captain Ben Stokes maintained a spread field for much of the time, aiming to prevent boundaries while still exerting pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a>. He made "extraordinary" field placements, such as having three men on the leg-side boundary for Ravindra Jadeja, positioned about 25 meters away, essentially daring him to hit a single or a six, but not a four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>.

The decision to keep the field back was influenced by the ball getting soft, making singles a struggle for India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>. While this approach got England to the five-wicket period, they might have been "15 runs slow on bringing the fielders in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>, which subsequently led to more boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>. Stokes also experimented with various field settings, including three fielders on the offside and six on the leg side, and trying a short leg without a helmet just before lunch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>.

## Spinner Performance
England's spinners have taken a similar number of wickets to their Indian counterparts without necessarily having the same level of control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>. This could be attributed to luck, different fielding, or different playing styles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>.

The challenge for spinners like Moeen Ali, Tom Hartley, or Shoaib Bashier is "the ability to keep pressure on" when the wicket is flat, or when they should be on top, they are not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>. This is because they sometimes bowl a few inconsistent deliveries, allowing the opposition to escape pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:42]</a>. Below their best balls, they tend to struggle more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>.

Early in the series, India was likely "sucked in to the kind of [[analysis_of_englands_basball_strategy | Basball hype and moment]]" themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:26">[00:52:26]</a>, which contributed to [[bowler_performances_and_strategies | England's bowling]] seeming to "overperform" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:35">[00:51:35]</a>. England also had "very good plans for different players," noting that Dhruv Jurel and Yashasvi Jaiswal seemed unsure what to do, whereas they had clear plans for other Indian batters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:02">[00:52:02]</a>.

The role of the third umpire in cricket has been a subject of discussion, particularly concerning the consistency and expertise in their decision-making, especially when utilizing technology for [[impact_of_technology_in_cricket_officiating | DRS reviews]].

## Third Umpire Decision-Making

Third umpires rely on various technological tools, including sound waves and different camera angles, to assess dismissals, particularly those involving bat-on-ball or bat-on-pad contact. However, interpreting these inputs can be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.

### Challenges in Assessment
*   **Optical Illusions** When a bat is straight on, it can create an optical illusion, making it difficult to discern if the ball hit the bat or the pad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. The best angle to see deviations with a straight bat is typically from long-off, using a low camera with a long lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.
*   **Sound Wave Interpretation** There have been instances where a third umpire has misidentified a sound wave, attributing it to an edge when it was more likely the bat hitting the pad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.

## Case Studies: Joel Wilson's Decisions

Umpire Joel Wilson's decisions during a recent match highlighted these challenges, leading to [[controversial_decisions_and_news_in_international_cricket | controversial decisions]].
*   **Jaiswal's Dismissal** In a review involving Jaiswal, Wilson gave him not out, believing the bat was involved. However, video evidence suggested the bat only flicked the pad, with a clear gap between the ball and the bat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. Wilson seemed to miss the bat hitting the pad and incorrectly attributed the sound wave to an edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.
*   **Joe Root's Dismissal** A similar situation occurred with Joe Root's dismissal, where Wilson made a decision based on the sound wave, potentially overlooking contact with the pad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.
*   **Pattern of Error** This marked the second instance in the same game where Wilson appeared to make a decision based on a waveform, assuming it was bat-on-ball contact rather than bat-on-pad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.

## Argument for Specialist Third Umpires

The inconsistencies in third umpire decisions have led to calls for specialist third umpires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.
*   **Lack of Specialization** Currently, umpires rotate between standing and third umpire roles. Joel Wilson, for example, has performed as a third umpire in only about 22% of his 511 professional umpiring performances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>. This means he spends less than a quarter of his career in the third umpire role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>.
*   **Unique Skill Set** Third umpiring requires a distinct skill set, including a deep understanding of technology, a partnership with TV directors and technicians, and the ability to quickly ask for specific camera angles and information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>. These skills are different from those required for standing umpiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>.
*   **Improved Consistency and Speed** A dedicated team of specialist third umpires, working consistently with a regular crew of technicians, could lead to quicker and more accurate decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30">[00:39:30]</a>. This contrasts with other sports like NBA or NFL where refs review screens, potentially slowing down decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:10">[00:40:10]</a>.
*   **Addressing Errors** The number of errors in third umpiring suggests that a specialized approach would significantly reduce issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>.

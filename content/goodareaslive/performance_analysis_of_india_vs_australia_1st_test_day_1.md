The first day of the Test match between [[Cricket match analysis between India and Australia | India]] and [[Cricket match analysis between India and Australia | Australia]] was marked by an extraordinary number of wickets, with both teams struggling to establish dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Day 1 Overview
[[Cricket match analysis between India and Australia | India]] won the toss and elected to bat first, a decision that, in hindsight, may have been incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This decision was made based on the historical average of 64.8 runs per wicket on Day 1 at this venue, suggesting batting would be easier early in the match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. However, wickets fell at an astonishing rate of 12.76 runs per wicket on this particular day, indicating an exceptionally challenging batting surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. The average seam movement was around 0.9 degrees for a significant portion of the day, making batting incredibly difficult for anyone facing fast bowling over 80 mph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

Ultimately, [[Cricket match analysis between India and Australia | India]] was bowled out for 150 runs on Day 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Despite dismissing [[Cricket match analysis between India and Australia | India]] for a low total, [[Cricket match analysis between India and Australia | Australia]] also struggled with the bat and was still significantly behind in the game by the end of the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

### Pitch Conditions and Curator's Intent
The Perth pitch is generally known to "fall apart" later in Test matches, and the curator's intention was to introduce more moisture and keep it greener to improve batting conditions over days two, three, and four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>. This attempt resulted in an exceptionally challenging surface on Day 1, with significant seam movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. The change in the Kookaburra ball since 2020, with extra lacquer and a reinforced seam, contributes to increased seam movement globally, especially in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>.

### [[Batting performance analysis of India and Australia | India's Batting Performance]]
[[Batting performance analysis of India and Australia | India]]'s batting struggled due to late and indecisive shots, combined with excellent fast bowling and significant seam movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Rishabh Pant was noted as the only batter seemingly capable of doing anything noteworthy on the challenging pitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The top-order batters, especially those new to playing a Test in Perth, faced challenges from the extra pace of the wicket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>. Even players known for defensive techniques and good temperament, like Cheteshwar Pujara and Marnus Labuschagne, found it impossible to score freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:16">[00:45:16]</a>.

### [[Batting performance analysis of India and Australia | Australia's Batting Performance]]
[[Batting performance analysis of India and Australia | Australia]]'s "faulty top four" delivered a poorer performance than [[Batting performance analysis of India and Australia | India]]'s batters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Only Marnus Labuschagne had a prolonged innings, which included being dropped, missing shots, and potentially benefiting from an obstructing the field situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Other key Australian batters like Khawaja, Travis Head, and Steve Smith also struggled to make runs, reflecting a broader issue of low scores in Australian first-class cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

## Key Bowling Performances

### [[Test Match Analysis IND vs ENG 4th Test Day 3 | Australia's Bowling Performance]]
*   **Mitchell Starc:** Displayed his best form in a long time, showing renewed rhythm, a mix of swing and wobble ball, and consistent length, making him a completely different bowler from what has been seen in Test cricket recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. His performance at Optus Stadium, where he consistently bowls well in the first 10 overs, was notable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.
*   **Josh Hazlewood:** Was "awesome" and continued his remarkable form from the last 12-14 months, averaging around 11 or 12 this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. His recent performance has been exceptionally brutal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.
*   **Mitch Marsh:** Despite not bowling much this year due to injury, Marsh delivered an important spell, particularly his dismissal of Durell, who appeared to be [[Batting performance analysis of India and Australia | India]]'s most confident player outside of Pant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.
*   **Pat Cummins:** Was considered the weakest link among [[Test Match Analysis IND vs ENG 4th Test Day 3 | Australia]]'s bowlers on Day 1, appearing rusty and over-pitching the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

### Jasprit Bumrah's "Godlike" Performance
[[Analysis of India vs Australia 1st Test Day 3 performance | Jasprit Bumrah]] delivered a "Godlike" and "absolute perfection" bowling display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. His ability to adapt to the pitch quickly, bowling fuller lengths while keeping the stumps in play, was magnificent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>. Notably, he has improved his new ball bowling, which was previously considered his "Achilles heel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. His "match factor" in [[Australia vs India 4th Test match analysis | Australia]] is 43% better than other bowlers in those games, including top bowlers like Starc, Cummins, and Hazlewood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. [[Analysis of India vs Australia 1st Test Day 3 performance | Bumrah]] is nearing a record-low bowling average for players with over 200 wickets, placing him among legends like Ambrose, Barnes, and Hadley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>. His control, accuracy, and ability to combine various bowling skills (wobble, seam, swing, reverse swing, slower balls) make him a truly special player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:31">[00:42:31]</a>.

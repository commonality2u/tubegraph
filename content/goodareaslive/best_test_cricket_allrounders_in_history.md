Episode 20 of the Crick Picks podcast featured Bam Kazi, Estelle Vasudevan, and Jared Kimber discussing their top five all-time Test all-rounders in a snake-style draft format, where the picking order alternates 1-2-3, then 3-2-1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Jared Kimber began the draft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Drafted Test All-Rounders

### Sir Garfield Sobers (Jared's Pick 1)
Sir Garfield Sobers was selected as the greatest all-rounder in cricket history, considered a safe and obvious choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   **Batting**: Averaged nearly 58 with the bat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, seen as one of the [[greatest_test_batters_of_all_time | greatest batters]] of all time, likely a top 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Held the highest individual score in Test cricket (365 not out) until 1994 when Brian Lara broke it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. He was an attacking batsman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.
*   **Bowling**: Averaged 34 with the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, taking 235 wickets in 93 Tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. He was a very good swing bowler, averaging around 27-28, but also bowled left-arm finger spin and left-arm wrist spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. He often opened the bowling as the second or third best choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, bowling something like 37 overs per game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Fielding**: Considered worth two [[best_fielders_in_cricket_history | fielders]] when he was younger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Athleticism**: A brilliant athlete, doing things modern players wouldn't be allowed to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Impact**: Natural entertainer, just wanted to play cricket and get paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. His career longevity and consistent greatness from beginning to end are highlighted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

### Imran Khan (Bayam's Pick 1)
Imran Khan is praised for his peak performance and impact on Pakistani cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   **Peak Performance**: For a decade (1981-1991), he averaged over 54 with the bat and less than 20 with the ball, considered one of the biggest peaks in Test cricket history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   **Overall Stats**: In 88 Tests, he averaged 37.7 with the bat and 22.8 with the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, accumulating 362 wickets and nearly 4,000 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Bowling**: Described as really fast, utilizing reverse swing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Batting**: Despite a 37.7 batting average, he was a "not out merchant" who often scored between 30 and 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
*   **Impact & Charisma**: Transcended cricket, changed the landscape of Pakistan cricket, taught reverse swing to Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. He was a sex symbol in Australia and England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. He also brought out the best in himself as captain, leading Pakistan to Test series victories in England and India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   **Comparison**: Jared argues Sobers had a better overall career, but acknowledges Imran's peak and captaincy make a strong case for him being the best all-rounder of all time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

### Jacques Kallis (Estelle's Pick 1)
Jacques Kallis is considered an uncontroversial top pick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a> due to his massive advantage as a player who could give a full quota of overs and score serious runs batting in the top order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   **Stats**: 13,000+ runs and 292 wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a> in 166 Test matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Averaged 55 with the bat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a> and 32.65 with the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Batting**: Scored 45 centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. His batting average was higher than Sachin Tendulkar's, and his bowling average was better than Zaheer Khan's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. Considered world-class and consistently among the top three to five batters in his era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:35">[01:14:35]</a>.
*   **Bowling**: Provided good fast bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. He was often a fourth or fifth bowler, with a lower overs-per-game average (around 22) compared to Sobers (37) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. There were times he had to be persuaded to use both his skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.
*   **Comparison**: Some believe he could be better than Sobers or Imran Khan if he had bowled more overs in earlier eras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. Considered by many the greatest batting all-rounder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:35">[01:14:35]</a>. His longevity is a significant factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

### Sir Richard Hadlee (Estelle's Pick 2)
Sir Richard Hadlee is recognized for his phenomenal bowling prowess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:05">[01:13:05]</a>.
*   **Stats**: 431 wickets in 86 Tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>, with a ridiculous bowling average of 22.29 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. He also has 3,100+ runs with a batting average of 27 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. He had more five-wicket hauls than four-wicket hauls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>.
*   **Bowling**: Often considered the best bowler among his contemporaries like Imran Khan and Kapil Dev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. He was essentially a "one-man bowling attack" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>, bowling too many overs for a fast bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.
*   **Batting**: Made two Test centuries, one of which was "gifted" by the West Indies team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>. His batting is considered more "handy" than consistently great, perhaps on par with someone like Ravichandran Ashwin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.
*   **Underestimation**: Jared believes he is very underestimated as a bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.

### Ravindra Jadeja (Bayam's Pick 2)
Ravindra Jadeja was picked for his all-round clutch performances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>.
*   **Stats**: In 72 Test matches, he averages 36 with the bat and 24 with the ball, yielding a differential of 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>. He has 294 wickets and over 3,000 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.
*   **Batting**: Very clutch, scoring important runs for India, and has a triple century in first-class cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>.
*   **Bowling**: Brilliant in Asian conditions and can run through batting orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.
*   **Fielding**: Arguably the best [[best_fielders_in_cricket_history | fielder]] in contemporary cricket, adding a three-dimensional aspect to his all-round ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.
*   **Comparison**: Considered a "hot take" pick at this stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>. While perhaps too early for a top 5 claim, he is putting together an incredible case and would be in many people's top 10 already <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>.

### Keith Miller (Jared's Pick 2)
Keith Miller is highlighted for his unique combination of batting position and bowling role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>.
*   **Stats**: Averages around 36-37 with the bat and 22-23 with the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>. He took 170 wickets in 55 Test matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>.
*   **Role**: He opened the bowling and batted at number four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>, a combination almost unique to him and Sobers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>.
*   **Batting**: Famously lazy, often getting bored and getting out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>. Despite this, he averaged 37 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>. When batting at number five, his average increased to 42 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>. His strike rate and "fear factor" were significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>.
*   **Bowling**: He was a great opening bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:18">[00:25:18]</a>.
*   **Athleticism & Life**: A world-class athlete who could have played any sport, including professional Aussie Rules Football and as a jockey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>. He likely missed three or four years of his prime due to World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>.

### Ian Botham (Jared's Pick 3)
Ian Botham is chosen for his "slightly more all-round cricketer" profile compared to Kapil Dev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a>.
*   **Stats**: Played 102 Test matches with 383 wickets and 5,200 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>.
*   **Potential**: If he was just about batting, he would have been a dashing number four averaging in the low 40s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>. As a bowler, he could have been a "canny chaos bowler" who took tons of wickets even if he couldn't bat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>.
*   **Consistency**: Had high peaks and low troughs, but his early career was arguably the greatest an all-rounder has ever been over a 20-30 Test sample <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>.
*   **Off-field impact**: His record was achieved despite partying and not always taking cricket seriously, especially in the fourth innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>.
*   **Athleticism**: Another incredible, next-level athlete, also a professional in two different sports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>.

### Ben Stokes (Bayam's Pick 3)
Ben Stokes is selected as potentially the most clutch cricketer of all time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>.
*   **Stats**: In 102 Tests, he has a batting average of 35+ and a bowling average of 32 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>. He has 198 wickets and over 6,300 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>. Holds the fastest 200 in Test cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:29">[00:32:29]</a>.
*   **Role**: An impact player who rescues innings from turmoil and provides quick, impactful wickets as a partnership breaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>.
*   **Impact**: Revolutionized the game with "Bazball" and funky fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:46]</a>. Known for match-winning knocks (e.g., Headingley, Ashes, ODI and T20 World Cups) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:59">[00:31:59]</a>.
*   **Bowling**: Considered one of the best fifth bowlers of all time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:13">[00:34:13]</a>. Has an excellent record bowling to set batters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>.
*   **Athleticism & Character**: A terrific athlete and one of the best [[best_fielders_in_cricket_history | fielders]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:40">[00:35:40]</a>. His comeback from personal lows is a testament to his character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>.

### Kapil Dev (Estelle's Pick 3)
Kapil Dev's longevity and pioneering role as an Indian seam bowler are emphasized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>.
*   **Stats**: Played 131 Tests, taking 434 wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:37]</a> and scoring over 5,200 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:37]</a>. His batting average was 31.05 and bowling average was 29.64 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a>.
*   **Bowling**: A "steady" bowler, very similar to Hadlee but not as good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>. He consistently bowled around 40 overs per game when away from home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>.
*   **Batting**: Had 8 centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:50">[00:39:50]</a>. His batting was "impactful," with the ability to "ruin your Test match with the bat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>.
*   **Pioneer**: He was the first Indian seam bowler in an era that had never seen one before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>. He would still get into the side now due to his skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:15">[00:39:15]</a>.
*   **Athleticism**: A brilliant athlete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.

### Shakib Al Hasan (Estelle's Pick 4)
Shakib Al Hasan is recognized for his unique position as the best batter and best bowler in his team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:30">[00:42:30]</a>.
*   **Stats**: Played 67 Tests, averaging nearly 39 with the bat and 31.16 with the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>. He has 237 wickets and over 4,500 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:57">[00:42:57]</a>.
*   **Impact**: The greatest player Bangladesh has ever produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:28">[00:42:28]</a>, consistently their best batter and bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:30">[00:42:30]</a>. He is the guy opposition teams want to get out first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>.
*   **Away Record**: His batting average away from home (37) is comparable to Stokes' overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:49">[00:43:49]</a>, and his bowling average away (31.7) is better than Stokes' career average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>, challenging the perception of him as a Bangladesh specialist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a>.
*   **Limitations**: The low number of Tests played by Bangladesh (67 for Shakib) is considered an injustice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a>. He often had to bat out of position (e.g., number three, four, five) and act as the main spinner in an ordinary team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:54">[00:45:54]</a>.

### Andrew Flintoff (Bayam's Pick 4)
Andrew Flintoff is chosen for his ability to capture the moment and his impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:58">[00:46:58]</a>, despite a negative average differential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:47">[00:46:47]</a>.
*   **Stats**: Played 79 Tests, with a batting average of 31.77 and a bowling average of 32.78 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:52">[00:46:52]</a>. He took 226 wickets and scored over 3,800 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:30">[00:47:30]</a>.
*   **Impact**: A mesmerizing cricketer, especially in the 2005 and 2009 Ashes series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>. He was a very belligerent batter, smashing the ball, and could "crank it up" to 90+ mph when fully fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:26">[00:47:26]</a>.
*   **Bowling Analysis**: His bowling average suffered because he was dreadful against tail-enders, not picking up cheap wickets, but was one of the world's best bowlers against top-order batsmen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>.
*   **Talent vs. Performance**: His ceiling was very high; with more focus on cricket, he could have been the best all-rounder of all time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.

### Aubrey Faulkner (Jared's Pick 4)
Aubrey Faulkner is picked as the only player in Test cricket to average more than 40 with the bat and less than 30 with the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.
*   **Stats**: Averages over 40 with the bat and under 30 with the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.
*   **Career Context**: Didn't play many Tests due to World War I, in which he almost died <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:07">[00:52:07]</a>. He started as a batter, learned leg spin, and became a bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:22">[00:53:22]</a>.
*   **Batting**: At his absolute best, he was probably a top three or four batter in the world of his period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:39">[00:52:39]</a>, including a double century in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:42">[00:55:42]</a>.
*   **Bowling**: In English and South African conditions, he was almost unplayable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:54">[00:52:54]</a>. He was one of the first to use the "wrong 'un" (googly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:56">[00:52:56]</a>.
*   **Impact**: Similar to Shakib Al Hasan, he was the best batter and best bowler for his team (South Africa), helping them win entire series with both bat and ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>.

### Tony Greig (Jared's Pick 5)
Tony Greig is chosen based on his strong statistics and the potential he showed before leaving for Packer's World Series Cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:56">[00:56:56]</a>.
*   **Stats**: In 58 Tests, he averaged 40 with the bat and 32 with the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:08">[00:57:08]</a>. He took 141 wickets and scored nearly 3,600 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:01">[00:58:01]</a>. In first-class cricket, he took 856 wickets at 28 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:20">[00:57:20]</a>.
*   **Role**: A "good handy" proper fifth bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:15">[00:57:15]</a>.
*   **Batting**: Batted better in Test cricket than county cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:24">[00:57:24]</a>.
*   **Impact**: Considered one of the most rebellious cricketers of all time, part of World Series Cricket and later the Indian Cricket League <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:27">[00:58:27]</a>. His tall stature (around 6'5" or 6'6") made him a commanding presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:08">[00:58:08]</a>.

### Shaun Pollock (Bayam's Pick 5)
Shaun Pollock is picked for his criminally underrated batting and consistency as a bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:22">[00:59:22]</a>.
*   **Stats**: Played 108 Tests with 421 wickets and nearly 3,800 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:42">[00:59:42]</a>. His batting average is over 32 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:27">[00:59:27]</a>, and his bowling average is 23.11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:49">[00:59:49]</a>. His average differential is nine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>.
*   **Bowling**: One of South Africa's finest pacers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:31">[00:59:31]</a>. Initially bowled 90 mph and could move the ball both ways, but his body gave up early, turning him into a medium-fast bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:13">[01:01:13]</a>.
*   **Batting**: Averaged 32 despite often batting at number eight, lower than Mark Boucher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. He is considered to have the best batting average at number eight and nine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:11">[01:00:11]</a>. He could have been a great number seven, averaging 33-34, if he had played for a different team with less batting depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:33">[01:00:33]</a>.

## Unpicked Notable Mentions

During the discussion, several other prominent all-rounders were mentioned who didn't make the final combined lists, often due to slightly lower statistical consistency or shorter peak periods:

*   **Trevor Goddard**: Averaged 35 with the bat and 26 with the ball, described as a "handy batter" and akin to a "Vettori of his time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:54">[01:08:54]</a>.
*   **Daniel Vettori**: A spinner who was considered a strong all-rounder but missed the list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:12">[01:09:12]</a>.
*   **Vinoo Mankad**: Mentioned for his significant impact, despite numbers not quite stacking up with the drafted players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:15">[01:09:15]</a>.
*   **Richie Benaud**: His second part of his career was "absolutely fantastic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:44">[01:14:44]</a>.
*   **Alan Davidson**: A bowler with batting talent, but perhaps not a true all-rounder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:27">[01:09:27]</a>.
*   **Shane Warne**: Averaged 18 with the bat (a "solid 18"), and an argument could be made for him as a great all-rounder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>.
*   **Mitchell Starc**: Similar to Warne and Davidson, having batting talent but questioned as a pure all-rounder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:32">[01:09:32]</a>.
*   **Pat Cummins**: Also in the category of bowlers who can bat a bit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:32">[01:09:32]</a>.
*   **Ravichandran Ashwin**: His batting was good enough, and he was a great bowler, making him comparable to Hadlee in terms of the all-rounder conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:52">[01:12:52]</a>.
*   **Wilfred Rhodes**: Played Test cricket for 31 years (1899 onwards), averaging 30 with the bat and 27 with the ball over a long career, and transitioned from a lower-order to top-order player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:47">[01:09:47]</a>.
*   **Wasim Akram**: Had a double century (257 not out) and another century in 104 matches, with an overall average of 22 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:46">[01:10:46]</a>. Considered more of a slogger with batting talent rather than a consistent all-rounder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:08">[01:11:08]</a>.
*   **Vernon Philander**: Was on a long list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:13">[01:11:13]</a>.
*   **Jason Holder**: His peak was "really good," but it was a short period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:23">[01:11:23]</a>.
*   **Sanath Jayasuriya**: Primarily a batter who could bowl a bit, also on the long list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:39">[01:12:39]</a>.
*   **Heath Streak**: Described as "absolutely fantastic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:17">[01:13:17]</a>.
*   **Mike Procter**: Didn't play enough Tests to make the list, but would have been included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:22">[01:13:22]</a>.
*   **Clive Rice**: Another South African all-rounder from that era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:30">[01:13:30]</a>.
*   **Learie Constantine** and **Jimmy Sinclair**: Both described as "absolutely fantastic cricketers" from older eras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:36">[01:13:36]</a>.
*   **Steve Waugh**: Considered a "fantastic all-rounder" whose bowling record might have been much better had he not been hampered by injuries late in his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:26">[01:14:26]</a>.
*   **Mark Waugh**: Started as a medium pacer and ended up bowling spin, showing athleticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:50">[01:14:50]</a>.

From: [[goodareaslive]] <br/> 

The [[importance_of_the_border_gavaskar_trophy_in_global_cricket | Border Gavaskar Trophy]] has grown to become arguably the most significant rivalry in Test cricket, with some considering it larger than The Ashes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:19">[01:44:19]</a>. This heightened status is largely attributed to India's significant global influence in cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:48">[03:10:48]</a>.

## Evolution of the Rivalry

The [[importance_of_the_border_gavaskar_trophy_in_global_cricket | Border Gavaskar Trophy]] was not considered a major fixture before the 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:33">[01:47:33]</a>. A pivotal moment was the 2001 series in India, where VVS Laxman's 280 runs helped India win in Kolkata after being made to follow on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:08">[01:49:08]</a>. Further milestones included India drawing 1-1 in Australia with Rahul Dravid's performance in Adelaide, and Australia's victory in India in 2004 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:14">[02:01:14]</a>.

Initially, the rivalry was primarily significant to fans in India and Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:06">[02:56:06]</a>. The dynamic shifted when India's bowling attack improved, leading to a change in power dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:56">[02:44:56]</a>. The 2008 series was a major flashpoint, after which the Indian Premier League (IPL) emerged, fundamentally altering global cricket's landscape towards India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:40">[03:41:40]</a>.

Australia, historically dismissive of other nations, began viewing winning in India as equally important to winning The Ashes, a mindset often credited to Steve Waugh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:20">[04:22:20]</a>. This perspective was evident when Adam Gilchrist considered Australia's 2004 series victory in India as his greatest accomplishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:19">[04:44:19]</a>.

Recently, the [[competitive_dynamics_in_test_cricket_between_india_and_australia | rivalry has become increasingly feisty]], with tempers flaring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:24">[07:51:24]</a>. Instances like Tim Paine's sledging of Ravichandran Ashwin, followed by Rishabh Pant winning the [[performance_review_of_the_india_vs_australia_gaba_test_match | Gaba Test match]] (a former Australian fortress), highlight the intensity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:11">[08:02:11]</a>. The rise of social media has further amplified this conflict, with both Australian and Indian fans engaging actively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:21">[08:25:21]</a>.

> India has secured back-to-back series victories in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. The upcoming series offers India the chance to secure a third consecutive win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:15">[02:19:15]</a>.

## Current Significance

The upcoming [[cricket_match_analysis_between_india_and_australia | series]] carries immense importance with several subplots:
*   India seeks a third consecutive series win ("three-peat") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:17">[05:06:17]</a>.
*   Australia is seeking revenge for recent losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:37">[05:07:37]</a>.
*   It is a crucial series for [[importance_of_the_border_gavaskar_trophy_in_global_cricket | World Test Championship final qualification]] for both teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:48">[05:10:48]</a>.
    *   If Australia loses, their series against Sri Lanka becomes difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:35">[05:15:35]</a>.
    *   If India loses, they might not qualify for the final <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:04">[05:22:04]</a>.
*   Many consider Australia and India to be the two best Test teams currently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:42">[05:48:42]</a>.
*   India's recent [[indias_dominance_in_ausvind_test_series | Test series wins in Australia]] have significantly boosted their confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:17">[07:46:17]</a>.

While Australia has a strong overall record (20 wins, 6 losses in the last 32 Test matches, current World Test Champions), their recent performances against India have been less favorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:48">[01:40:48]</a>.

## Australia's Team Analysis

Australia's team is generally solid, but the absence of Cameron Green due to injury creates a significant gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:17">[10:06:17]</a>. Green, a pace-bowling all-rounder, batted at number four, and his absence disrupts the team's balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:35">[10:17:35]</a>. The team has addressed this by moving Steve Smith back to number four and selecting Nathan McSweeney to open the batting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:43">[10:28:43]</a>.

Concerns exist about McSweeney opening, as he typically bats at numbers three, four, or five in First Class cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:59">[10:56:59]</a>. While he is considered a Test-quality player, he is not seen as an opener <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:56:32">[11:56:32]</a>. The Australian batting average has dropped significantly, by about 10 runs per wicket, in recent years, which is partly due to pitches favoring bowlers and the reinforced Kookaburra ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>.

Australia's current top four batters are viewed as risky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:06">[15:01:06]</a>:
*   Usman Khawaja, though the most in-form, hasn't been in great recent form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:37">[14:15:37]</a>.
*   Marnus Labuschagne has been struggling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:24:00">[14:24:00]</a>.
*   Steve Smith is moving around the batting order and is not the same player he once was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:28:00">[14:28:00]</a>.

While the bowling attack of Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, and Nathan Lyon is formidable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:02:40">[19:02:40]</a>, the lack of a bowling all-rounder due to injuries to Green and Mitch Marsh means these four bowlers will have to bowl a high volume of overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:46:00">[20:46:00]</a>.

## India's Team Analysis

India also faces significant challenges with key players unavailable or injured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:04:17">[26:04:17]</a>:
*   Captain Rohit Sharma is unavailable for the first Test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:06:00">[26:06:00]</a>.
*   Shubman Gill, who had been in good form, fractured his thumb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:13:21">[26:13:21]</a>.
*   The team lacks clarity on its number six batter, with options like Sarfaraz Khan, KL Rahul, and Dhruv Jurel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:25:27">[26:25:27]</a>.
*   Mohammed Shami is unavailable for at least the first two Tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:32:00">[26:32:00]</a>. The absence of Shami and Hardik Pandya (who was not selected) limits India's bowling depth and flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:05:00">[21:05:00]</a>.
*   Kuldeep Yadav is also out of favor or injured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:09:00">[21:09:00]</a>.

India's likely playing XI for the first Test is hard to formulate due to these absences, especially in opening and the number three position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:31:00">[28:31:00]</a>. The team lacks faith in its backup bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:08:00">[25:08:00]</a>.

## Impact of Pitches and Player Fitness

Australian pitches, particularly at Optus Stadium in Perth, are expected to favor fast bowlers with pace and bounce, potentially leading to shorter Test matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:17:35">[25:17:35]</a>. This could help Australia, as they have more pace bowling options than India currently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:47:00">[25:47:00]</a>. The Kookaburra ball's characteristics have also contributed to lower batting averages in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>.

Fitness plays a crucial role in a five-Test series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:56:00">[23:56:00]</a>. Australia has better cover for their key bowlers (Hazlewood, Cummins) if they are not fully fit, unlike India with Jasprit Bumrah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:26:00">[24:26:00]</a>. India's history of wins in Australia despite numerous injuries, such as in 2021 at the Gaba, highlights their resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:16:00">[39:16:00]</a>.

> "the batting average in Australia has dropped by 10 runs per Wicket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:00">[12:36:00]</a>

## Predictions and Outlook

The series is expected to be highly competitive, with individual moments potentially deciding the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:55:00">[0:55:00]</a>. Both teams are considered "aging" but possess strong hunger to win, especially with the World Test Championship final on the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:49:00">[35:49:00]</a>.

For India to succeed, Jasprit Bumrah and Rishabh Pant are identified as key players who need to perform exceptionally well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:10:00">[36:10:00]</a>. Virat Kohli's runs would be a bonus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:17:00">[36:17:00]</a>.

Many anticipate a close series, with the possibility of the series being level heading into the final Test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:56:00">[50:56:00]</a>. This [[india_vs_australia_test_cricket_analysis | series]] could be a career-defining moment for some veteran players like Steve Smith and Virat Kohli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:53:00">[34:53:00]</a>. Some speculate about potential retirements after the series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:30:00">[35:30:00]</a>.

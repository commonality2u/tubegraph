From: [[goodareaslive]] <br/> 

[[Jasprit Bumrahs performance across formats | Jasprit Bumrah]] is currently enjoying a peak in his career described as "freakish in nature" since returning from injury [00:00:52]. His exceptional performance spans all formats of international cricket [00:01:13].

## Post-Injury Performance Metrics
Since his return, [[Jasprit Bumrahs performance across formats | Bumrah]] has played 31 international matches across formats, taking 74 wickets at an average of less than 16 runs per wicket [00:00:57]. His economy rate has been under four runs per over, and he is striking at a wicket every 25 deliveries [00:01:01]. These numbers indicate that the phase of the game, format, or playing conditions do not affect his performance; he operates at an "other-worldly level" [00:01:13]. This period, spanning roughly nine months, might be "one of the greatest peaks of any bowler ever," especially when considering his performance across formats [00:01:22].

## Comparisons with Cricket Legends
The current peak of [[Jasprit Bumrahs performance across formats | Jasprit Bumrah]] has led to comparisons with historical fast bowlers:
*   **Waqar Younis**: Compared to Waqar Younis in the early 90s, before his injury [00:02:11].
*   **Dale Steyn**: Dale Steyn also "completely wreak havoc across formats" in more recent times [00:02:17].
*   **West Indian Pacers**: The "Four Horsemen" of West Indian fast bowlers in the 1980s are also brought into the discussion [00:02:23].
*   **Michael Holding**: His overall numbers are compared to Michael Holding, noting Holding played fewer games and innings but at a different time [00:02:34].
*   **Mitchell Starc & Glenn McGrath**: At times, their performances in World Cups were similar [00:03:00]. However, it's questioned if anyone has shown [[Jasprit Bumrahs performance across formats | Bumrah's]] level of dominance across all three formats [00:03:12].
*   **Muttiah Muralitharan**: Murle had two years where he took over 120 international wickets [00:03:34].
*   **Glenn McGrath**: In 1999, McGrath took 119 wickets [00:03:47].
*   **Mitchell Johnson**: Had a year with 113 wickets [00:03:56].
*   **Shane Warne**: Took 121 wickets in a year at an average of 19 across all formats [00:04:05].
*   **Allan Donald**: Averaged 18 with over 100 wickets in a year [00:04:10].
*   **Joel Garner**: Took over 100 international wickets in one year at an average of 18 [00:04:17].

While these bowlers had high wicket-taking years, international cricket was different then, with more matches played and no IPL to manage player workloads [00:04:25]. Therefore, while [[Jasprit Bumrahs performance across formats | Bumrah]] may not match some of the highest wicket counts in a single year, his "impact he quite clearly is" on par [00:04:39].

## T20 Cricket Prowess
[[Jasprit Bumrahs performance across formats | Bumrah]] is considered "literally unplayable" in T20 cricket [00:04:59].

### [[Bumrahs performance in the T20 World Cup | T20 World Cup Performance]]
In the ongoing T20 World Cup, as of the recording, he has been unplayable, except for the Australia game where he conceded 29 runs [00:05:01]. In T20 Internationals for India since his injury return, he has taken 15 wickets in eight games, with an average of 8.73 and an economy of 4.24 [00:05:22]. In his last 24 overs for India, he has gone for more than 10 runs only twice [00:05:37].

### IPL 2024 Performance
His T20 World Cup performance comes after an "even more miraculous bowling effort" in the IPL 2024, which was the highest-scoring T20 tournament ever seen [00:05:47].
In 13 IPL games, [[Jasprit Bumrahs performance across formats | Bumrah]] took 20 wickets with an economy rate of 6.5 and an average under 17, striking once every 15.5 deliveries [00:06:13]. This shows that even when "everyone was hitting sixes for fun," [[Jasprit Bumrahs performance across formats | Bumrah]] "wasn't getting hit" [00:06:29]. His IPL performance is seen as a greater testament to his current form due to stronger batting lineups and batting-aiding surfaces compared to the World Cup [00:06:44].

### Comparison to Lasith Malinga (T20)
[[Comparisons of Jasprit Bumrah with other fast bowlers | Bumrah]] is compared to Lasith Malinga, considered one of the greatest T20 bowlers [00:07:16]. [[Comparisons of Jasprit Bumrah with other fast bowlers | Bumrah]] has a better true economy than Malinga in 75% of an IPL game's overs [00:07:25]. Crucially, in the last three overs of an IPL game, [[Comparisons of Jasprit Bumrah with other fast bowlers | Bumrah]] concedes fewer runs than Malinga and has a better true economy, despite Malinga being a renowned death-over specialist [00:07:42].

## [[Jasprit Bumrahs unique bowling techniques | Unique Bowling Techniques]] and Threat
[[Jasprit Bumrahs unique bowling techniques | Bumrah's unique action]] is at the core of his success [00:08:08].

### Shortening the Pitch
His action allows him to deliver the ball around half a meter closer to batters than most other bowlers, effectively "shortening the pitch" [00:08:43]. This enables him to "rush guys" even at 88 miles per hour, while others bowling at 90 mph may not [00:09:09]. Batters are trained to expect the ball from a certain distance, and [[Jasprit Bumrahs unique bowling techniques | Bumrah]] takes "half a meter off that," making the ball feel like it's coming earlier than expected [00:09:50].

### Short Run-up and Release Point
[[Jasprit Bumrahs unique bowling techniques | Bumrah]] has a short run-up, unlike most bowlers who gain information from longer run-ups [00:10:03]. This, combined with his release point being closer to the stumps, is a "huge advantage" [00:11:46]. Standard actions like Chris Woakes', Umesh Yadav's, or Brett Lee's are familiar to batters, but [[Jasprit Bumrahs unique bowling techniques | Bumrah's]] "outlier" action makes batters "in a different mindset" [00:12:05].

### Accuracy and Variations
[[Jasprit Bumrahs unique bowling techniques | Bumrah]] is more accurate than most bowlers of his pace and has greater control over his variations [00:10:08]. He can place his slower balls "in the right spot over and over again" [00:10:17].

Unlike bowlers like Glenn McGrath or Vernon Philander who might stick to one designated length, [[Jasprit Bumrahs unique bowling techniques | Bumrah]] has "multiple lengths for his different variations and he Nails each of those lengths every single time" [00:13:20]. He possesses about five distinct lengths he can bowl, including back of a length (to curb run-scoring), length balls (wicket-taking), and devastating Yorkers [00:14:27]. He can also accurately pitch his cutters [00:14:32].

### Unplayable Even When "Bad"
Even his "slot balls" (economy of 7.5, average of 30 in IPL 2024) and "full tosses" (economy of 5.5, average of 15 in IPL 2024) are difficult to score off [00:16:06]. This is because his unique action rushes batters, making them "behind the ball" even when he makes a mistake [00:16:38]. Batters often adopt a conservative approach against him, and he has already put them under pressure with his good deliveries [00:16:45]. His "bad bowls have numbers recently which are better than entire careers of Bowlers" [00:18:09].

### [[Challenges in facing Jasprit Bumrah | Challenges in Facing Him]]
It is "extremely tough" to play a pull shot off [[Jasprit Bumrahs unique bowling techniques | Bumrah's]] back-of-a-length delivery; in IPL 2024, batters averaged 10 when attempting it [00:18:17]. He is "impossible to take on with most shots" [00:18:30]. Even batters with a wide range of shots, like Glenn Maxwell, get out frequently to him despite scoring quickly [00:19:03].

Historically, JP Duminy and Manish Pandey had good strike rates against him early in his career before he fully developed [00:20:11]. More recently, Pat Cummins and Dinesh Karthik have shown some success [00:20:27]. Karthik's unorthodoxy and ability to find boundary options against pace might explain his relative success [00:20:41].

## Impact Beyond Wickets (Gravitational Force)
[[Jasprit Bumrahs impact in all cricket formats | Bumrah's]] "gravitational force is massive" [00:06:00].

### Assisted Wickets
A concept of "assisted wickets" is introduced, defined as wickets falling on the delivery immediately after a specific bowler completes their over [00:22:29]. In the IPL, [[Jasprit Bumrahs impact in all cricket formats | Bumrah]] is second only to Sunil Narine in the sheer volume of assisted wickets [00:22:41]. When looking at assisted wickets per total balls bowled, he is just behind T. Natarajan [00:22:50]. This occurs because batters often intentionally play him out due to the immense pressure he builds, leading them to attack the next bowler as soon as his over ends [00:23:01]. This means [[Jasprit Bumrahs impact in all cricket formats | Bumrah]] is "taking wickets at both ends" [00:23:13].

### Impact on Game Flow
[[Jasprit Bumrahs impact in all cricket formats | Bumrah]] influences the game far beyond his own overs [00:26:50]. His presence means that after he has bowled, teams are "usually down three or four runs" on what they should be, forcing them to "over attack the bowler at the other end" [00:24:26].

In T20 Internationals, the phase of the game does not impact [[Jasprit Bumrahs impact in all cricket formats | Bumrah's]] effectiveness; he is fantastic in the power play and a seasoned death-bowling specialist, often bowling the 17th and 19th overs [00:25:17]. In IPL games where [[Jasprit Bumrahs impact in all cricket formats | Bumrah]] plays, batters strike at a higher rate in overs 16 and 18 than the season's average for those overs [00:25:40]. This is because teams know scoring will be "extremely tough" in his overs, so they "throw the kitchen sink" at the overs around him [00:26:01]. This strategic impact, where teams know when he's coming and adjust their play, is "remarkable" and "literally stretching the bowling attack out" [00:26:40].

## Evolution of Fast Bowling
[[Jasprit Bumrahs unique bowling techniques | Bumrah's use of his wrist]] is seen as the "next evolution of fast bowling" [00:34:29]. This style likely stems from "rubber ball bowling" in Asia (tennis or tape ball cricket) and the natural evolution of slower balls [00:34:36]. He is described as a fast bowler with "some of the skills of a spin bowler" [00:35:15].

He possesses all the skills of a traditional fast bowler—getting the ball to swing, seam, wobble, and reverse—and combines these with spin bowling attributes [00:36:34]. This allows him to set up batters like an off-spinner, using bouncers to get them into position before delivering a deceptive ball [00:37:08]. This represents a "completely different level of bowling" not seen before and brings back old skills that disappeared from red-ball cricket, like finger spinners bowling arm balls or leg cutters [00:37:17].

[[Jasprit Bumrahs impact in all cricket formats | Bumrah]] is also a "disruptor," helping the game evolve [00:38:50]. His style will likely lead to more bowlers with similar wrist actions and artistry in the future, with him as a "pioneering point" in this generation [00:39:03].

## The Best All-Format Cricketer?
[[Evaluating current cricket players across formats | Jasprit Bumrah]] is seen as an "all face Bowler, all conditions Bowler, all format bowler" [00:39:13]. He is arguably the "best contemporary all format cricketer" [00:39:22].

He is considered the "best T20 player in the world at the moment," despite being a bowler who can only bowl 24 balls per game, unlike batters like Travis Head or Heinrich Klaasen who can bat for 50 balls [00:39:59]. Even during periods where he "struggled quote unquote," he wasn't going for runs, just not taking as many wickets [00:40:33].

It's believed that he does not receive the full respect he deserves, partly because he is known as a T20 bowler first, then an ODI bowler, and a Test bowler third [00:41:09]. He is on a level "never seen before," with no one having dominated all three formats with the ball in the same way [00:41:13]. He is also "as special in each individual format" as any bowler seen [00:41:24].

His only challenge to becoming an all-time great is longevity, needing "another four good years" of great play to solidify his position among the top all-format bowlers [00:41:33]. If he reaches around 240 Test wickets with an average below 21-22, despite India being his home wicket, he will be in "any conversation" for greatest seam bowlers of all time [00:42:10]. He might already be India's "best ever Bowler in history" [00:42:33].

### Comparison with Pat Cummins
[[Bumrahs performance and captaincy impact | Pat Cummins]] is suggested as a potential second-best all-format player [00:43:02]. While [[Bumrahs performance and captaincy impact | Cummins]] and [[Jasprit Bumrahs performance across formats | Bumrah]] are not far apart in Test cricket, [[Jasprit Bumrahs performance across formats | Bumrah]] is "so much better in white ball Cricket" [00:43:09]. It's argued that [[Jasprit Bumrahs performance across formats | Bumrah]] would be picked in all three formats over [[Bumrahs performance and captaincy impact | Cummins]] [00:43:43].

[[Jasprit Bumrahs performance across formats | Bumrah]] is believed to be better than peak Glenn McGrath across all formats, partly due to his "extra yard" of pace that he can access at any time [00:44:06]. He can embody both McGrath's precision and Mitchell Starc's pace in one package [00:44:24].

Ultimately, the gap between [[Jasprit Bumrahs performance across formats | Bumrah]] and the next best all-format cricketer (potentially [[Bumrahs performance and captaincy impact | Pat Cummins]] or Travis Head) is described as a "football field" [00:44:30].

## Introduction
[[Virat Kohlis retirement and legacy | Virat Kohli]] recently retired from Test cricket at the age of 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. His decision came after a period of intense scrutiny and a career marked by immense professionalism and a relentless will to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

## First Memories and Early Career
Robbie first met [[Virat Kohlis batting strategy and records | Virat Kohli]] during a felicitation event in 2007, following India's World Cup win and the U19 World Cup victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. At this event, he also met [[Rohit Sharmas Test Retirement and its Impact on Indian Cricket | Rohit Sharma]] and Ravindra Jadeja <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

A more significant early memory dates back to a Karnataka versus Delhi game in late 2006 at Kotla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. During this match, Kohli's father unfortunately passed away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Despite the tragedy, Kohli batted the following day, scoring a hundred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. His demeanor was described as "very resolute," with "very few emotions," like a steady ember rather than a burning fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. This moment offered a glimpse into his future greatness and how he held himself in difficult circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

## Intensity and Professionalism
Kohli's career has been characterized by his intense passion and absolute commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. He never "left anything out there on the field" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>, giving everything mentally and emotionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. This intensity often "grated people" when playing against him, as he pushed the boundaries of balanced intensity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

He was driven by a strong "pursuit of excellence" and an overwhelming "desire to win every game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. This combination, while powerful, could make others feel "inept" in matching his energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

Comparisons have been drawn between Kohli's approach and that of [[Ricky Ponting]] and [[Michael Jordan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. Like Jordan, Kohli seemed to struggle to understand why others couldn't match his self-willed determination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. His desire to win often tipped into a "fierce desperation" not to lose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

In contrast to AB de Villiers, who possessed natural talent that made things seem effortless, Kohli had to "stretch every last bit of talent out of himself" through sheer hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:52">[00:54:52]</a>. He is described as "easily the hardest working guy in the room" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. This dedication helped him manage physical challenges, such as a bad back, by building supporting muscles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. His professionalism was evident in his consistent gym routine, even fitting in workouts around interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.

## Impact on Indian Cricket
Kohli played a significant part in the [[Indias cricket team transition postKohli | transition of Indian cricket]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. He emerged at a time when India sought a new captain after MS Dhoni and a great batter following Sachin Tendulkar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. His energy and pursuit of excellence allowed him to fill both roles, becoming a great batter and the "next big great captain from India" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

As a Test captain, he was very good, particularly in his ability to make corrections over five days and leverage a strong bowling unit to take 20 wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. However, his "pursuit of excellence" sometimes "overpowered" his white-ball captaincy, where there is less time to correct mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

## Challenges and Evolution
The immense pressure of playing all three formats continuously, coupled with managing a global brand and family life, took a significant toll on Kohli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. The constant demands meant he was drawing from "only one bucket" of energy, leading to an overall drain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.

His period of "soul-searching" for a year or so was linked to external factors and shifting priorities, including family, marriage, and children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. The power shift in captaincy from him to [[Rohit Sharmas Test Retirement and its Impact on Indian Cricket | Rohit Sharma]] also contributed to this period of adjustment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

Despite his strong physicality, the relentless schedule of triple-format cricket, especially for Indian players who face high intensity and scrutiny from fans, led to mental and emotional fatigue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>. The rise of social media exacerbated this, with direct fan abuse adding to the psychological burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. As a highly emotional person, this constant pressure was particularly challenging for Kohli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.

## Batting Legacy
Kohli's ability to handle "top end pace" (140 km/h and faster) is considered a hallmark of his batting greatness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>. Even during dips in his form, his numbers against fast bowlers remained consistently high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:33">[00:35:33]</a>. This "self-belief and the conviction" in his ability against pace bowlers set him apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.

A memorable Test series was his performance in England, where he scored prolifically after struggling in a previous series against James Anderson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>. This comeback demonstrated his willingness to overcome technical flaws through sheer will and hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:07">[00:46:07]</a>.

One of his most incredible all-round Test performances was in the Adelaide Test match after Phil Hughes' death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:17]</a>. In a game marked by deep sadness, Kohli carried the Indian batting lineup twice, displaying a fierce will to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:10">[00:43:10]</a>.

## Test Retirement and Future Outlook
The recent retirements of Ashwin, [[Rohit Sharmas Test Retirement and its Impact on Indian Cricket | Rohit Sharma]], and [[Virat Kohlis batting strategy and records | Virat Kohli]] (specifically [[Retirement of Kohli Sharma and Jadeja from T20Is | Rohit and Virat leave]] Test cricket within 10 days of each other) signal a significant "reload" for Indian cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:15">[00:47:15]</a>. While batting depth is not a major concern, the main challenge for India's Test future lies in its bowling unit, particularly finding replacements for Ashwin and ensuring the longevity of fast bowlers like Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:33">[00:51:33]</a>.

Kohli's decision to retire from Tests at 36 is seen as a "measured decision" given his journey and the intensity he brought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:58">[01:16:58]</a>. He may continue playing [[Virat Kohli and his performance in ODI cricket | ODI cricket]] with the goal of winning the next World Cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:42">[01:22:42]</a>. His decision is not seen as abandoning Test cricket but rather a strategic choice to maximize his contributions for [[future_prospects_for_indian_cricket_after_rohit_sharmas_retirement | Indian cricket]].

## Public Perception and Media
The overwhelming volume of "love and hate" from his 270 million Instagram followers, along with the constant social media scrutiny, is a unique challenge for players like Kohli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>. This public pressure can be "depressing" and lead to a "spiral that is very hard to climb back up out of" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>.

Compared to previous generations, Kohli's era saw the emergence of the "triple format player" alongside the pervasive influence of social media, forcing players to navigate unprecedented mental and emotional loads simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>.

## Potential Post-Retirement Career
Given his natural conversational skills and enjoyment of talking, Kohli is expected to enter broadcasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:43">[01:33:43]</a>. While he may not need the money immediately, the opportunity to share his experiences and impact the narrative of cricket could be a strong motivator for him in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:30">[01:34:30]</a>.

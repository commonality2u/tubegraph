The Netherlands bowling attack in the 2023 World Cup faced significant challenges, often seeing their bowlers used beyond their ideal roles. Despite high economies, individual players demonstrated cleverness and resilience.

## Ruloff van der Merwe: The Clever Defensive Bowler

Ruloff van der Merwe is described as an "old defensive bowler" who is very clever at keeping economies down, even without the ability to "rip the ball" as he once did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>. He has found a way to be effective despite not having the same physical "juice" in his fingers, wrist, elbow, or shoulder that he once possessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.

Van der Merwe began his career as an attacking option for South Africa, with Johan Botha serving as the "spoiler bowler" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>. His current optimal role is as a second spinner, not the primary one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>. In the 2023 World Cup, his bowling average was over 50, and his economy rate was 5.5 runs an over, which is slightly more expensive than ideal for his defensive role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>. However, he has not been a liability and has supported the team when other bowlers have performed well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>.

> "He's worked a way of keeping economies down without ripping the ball the way that he wants did. I don't think his fingers or his wrist or his elbow his shoulder whatever it may be has the same juice in it that it once did but he's very very clever now at at that that spoiler baller role." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>

## Bas de Leede and Logan van Beek: Used Out of Position

Both Bas de Leede and Logan van Beek recorded some of the highest economies in the 2023 World Cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>. This was largely due to being used outside their optimal roles within the team's [[cricketing_roles_and_player_performance_assessment | bowling strategies]].

*   **Bas de Leede:** Ideally, de Leede should be, at best, the fifth bowler, delivering "softer overs" in the middle of the innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>. He is suited for bowling towards the end of the power play occasionally, through the middle overs, and potentially the "softer death overs" on a good day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>. However, he has been forced to bowl "everywhere" due to the team only using two other seamers, putting significant pressure on him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>. Despite this, he has taken a "bucket of wickets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>.
*   **Logan van Beek:** Van Beek's best usage is as a first-change bowler, coming on around the six or seven over mark after the main opening seamers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>. He could also be used for clever spells at the end, as a secondary death bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>. Instead, Van Beek has had to "completely step up," taking on responsibilities beyond his ideal usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>. He has also "stood up so many times for Dutch Cricket" in the last year and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:34">[00:27:34]</a>.

Despite their high economies, their performances are considered "earned" because they took on necessary roles for the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>.

## The de Leede Family: A Unique World Cup Legacy

The de Leede family has contributed significantly to Dutch World Cup wickets. The family accounts for 18.1% of all Dutch wickets taken in World Cups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>. Bas de Leede's father, Tim de Leede, "overperformed when it came to wicket-taking in World Cups," and Bas has done "exactly the same thing," possessing a "weird gene" for taking slightly more wickets than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>.

Bas de Leede surpassed his father, Tim, to become the leading Dutch player in terms of wickets taken in a single World Cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.

The 2023 tournament has been particularly good for Dutch [[bowler_performances_and_strategies | bowlers]], with Bas de Leede, Logan van Beek, Roelof van der Merwe, and Aryan Dutt all featuring prominently in the list of most wickets taken by a Dutch player in a World Cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>. This indicates a strong collective [[bowler_performances_and_strategies | performance]], especially considering the team's overall standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:18">[00:29:18]</a>.

India secured a four-wicket victory over Australia in the first semifinal of the Champions Trophy in Dubai, with 11 deliveries to spare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. This win propels India into their third Champions Trophy final, having won in 2013 and lost in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. This marks India's fourth consecutive ICC trophy final appearance, following the 2023 ICC World Test Championship final loss, the ODI World Cup final loss at home to Australia, and their T20 World Cup victory in the Caribbean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.

## Australia's Performance and Missed Opportunities

Despite India being expected to "steamroll" the Australian team due to missing players and favourable conditions, Australia managed to push them harder than any other team in the tournament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. Australia had moments where they could have seized a strong advantage. At the 36-over mark, they were 196 for four, potentially capable of scoring 300 or more runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.

Crucial dropped catches plagued Australia's fielding performance, including two dropped chances for Rohit Sharma and one for Virat Kohli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>. The pitch itself behaved unexpectedly, starting slow but getting faster as the innings progressed, contrary to the typical expectation of it becoming more difficult later in the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.

### Key Australian Batting Performances

Travis Head provided a berserk start in the power play, reaching the team's 50 in 7.2 overs and scoring 39 off 33 balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>. His dismissal by Varun Chakravarthy on the first ball he faced from the spinner was a major battle won for India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>.

Steve Smith's innings of 73 runs off 96 deliveries (strike rate 76) was described as "not great" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:56:00">[15:56:00]</a>. While he started well, rotating the strike and using his feet against spinners, he got stuck in the middle, struggled to find boundaries, and was eventually dismissed by a full toss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>. His innings put pressure on other batters and was considered "too slow" given the team's defensive bowling attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09:00">[16:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:41:00">[16:41:00]</a>.

Alex Carey was considered Australia's best batter, scoring 60 off 57 balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:41:00">[17:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:31:00">[18:31:00]</a>. He provided the necessary counter-punch for Australia, demonstrating versatility against both spin and pace bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:16:00">[18:16:00]</a>. His busy play allowed Smith to get out of being stuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:17:00">[19:17:00]</a>.

### Australian Bowling and Team Selection

Australia's decision to go with an extra spinner, Tanveer Sangha, was questioned, especially since the pitch didn't spin much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>. Tanveer Sangha struggled, bowling at Rohit Sharma's pads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>, and was seen as a defensive leg-spinner not suited for ODI cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>. Nathan Ellis, despite being a defensive option, bowled well at the death, taking two wickets for 49 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a>.

Cooper Connolly had a "fascinating game," dismissing Rohit Sharma for one wicket and 37 runs in eight overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>. However, he also recorded a nine-ball duck and dropped a crucial catch from Rohit Sharma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>.

## India's Performance

India's victory was characterized by excellent strike rotation, particularly by Virat Kohli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:42:00">[23:42:00]</a>. The team consistently took singles, preventing Australia from building pressure with back-to-back wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:22:00">[27:22:00]</a>.

### Key Indian Batting Performances

Virat Kohli was the player of the match with 84 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:47:00">[23:47:00]</a>. His innings featured only five boundaries, with everything else coming from singles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:59:00">[23:59:00]</a>. Kohli is noted for having the most singles in ODIs since January 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:10:00">[24:10:00]</a>. He proved his reputation as a master of the chase, scoring 50+ in five of his last six ICC knockout games across limited overs formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:41:00">[24:41:00]</a>.

Other notable contributions included Shreyas Iyer's 45 runs, demonstrating good strike rotation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:07:00">[28:07:00]</a>, and KL Rahul's unbeaten 42 towards the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:14:00">[28:14:00]</a>. Hardik Pandya contributed by hitting three massive sixes to finish the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:18:00">[28:18:00]</a>. Rohit Sharma's quickfire 28 off 25 balls in the power play was crucial for setting the chase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:06:00">[32:06:00]</a>.

### India's Bowling Performance

Mohammed Shami was the most successful Indian bowler, taking three wickets for 48 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:54:00">[33:54:00]</a>. Ravindra Jadeja delivered a crucial double breakthrough, taking the wickets of Smith and Inglis in quick succession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:09:00">[34:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:10:00">[35:10:00]</a>. Varun Chakravarthy also picked up two wickets despite going for runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:24:00">[35:24:00]</a>. Kuldeep Yadav, despite not taking many wickets, bowled effectively, maintaining an economy rate of 5.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:51:00">[35:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:14:00">[36:14:00]</a>.

### Captaincy and Tosses

Rohit Sharma has led India to four consecutive ICC finals, including the World Test Championship, ODI World Cup, T20 World Cup, and now the Champions Trophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:16:00">[33:16:00]</a>. This makes him the only individual to achieve this feat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:24:00">[33:24:00]</a>.

India has lost 14 tosses in ODI cricket consecutively, with Rohit Sharma losing 11 of those <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:00:00">[22:00:00]</a>. This streak includes the toss in the Champions Trophy semi-final <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:21:00">[22:21:00]</a>. The probability of this happening is as low as 0.6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:50:00">[22:50:00]</a>.

## Looking Ahead to the Final

If India wins the toss in the final, batting first is generally considered the safer option to set a target of 275-280, which would be a handful to chase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:52:00">[38:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:12:00">[39:12:00]</a>.

India would ideally prefer to face New Zealand in the final over South Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:37:00">[41:37:00]</a>. New Zealand would need specific circumstances to beat India, while South Africa is seen as the second-best team in the tournament and capable of causing more problems, particularly with players like Heinrich Klaasen, Aiden Markram, and David Miller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:52:00">[41:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:24:00">[42:24:00]</a>. Kagiso Rabada also has a strong record against Rohit Sharma, and Marco Jansen offers a good new ball option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:27:00">[43:27:00]</a>.

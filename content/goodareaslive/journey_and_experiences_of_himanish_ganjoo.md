Himanish Ganjoo, a cosmologist and former analyst for the [[indias_cricket_team_transition_postKohli | Indian men's cricket team]], shares his unique path from studying the universe to decoding the nuances of cricket data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. His work primarily involves leveraging data to understand and enhance player performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>.

## Entry into Cricket Analytics

Ganjoo's engagement with cricket data began in 2015 when he was "jobless" and awaiting grad school applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. He harbored basic questions about the game, such as how batting averages had evolved in Test Cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Finding that existing databases were no longer maintained, he taught himself Python to gather data from various sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

He played cricket recreationally in school, but never formally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. His cosmologist background provides him with a strong foundation in math, problem-solving, and statistical techniques, which are transferable skills to cricket analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. Cosmology, the study of the universe's history and contents, involves writing code to mimic physics on supercomputers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

## The Axar Patel Article: A Catalyst

Ganjoo's significant break into cricket analytics was catalyzed by his research on Axar Patel following the 2021 England Series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Initially, he viewed Patel as a "left-arm dot bowler" akin to Ravindra Jadeja <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. However, after observing Patel's bowling style—wide of the crease with no turn—Ganjoo investigated the data to understand his effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

His analytical pieces, particularly for Crickinfo, usually involve starting with a triggering question, formulating it numerically, building metrics, and then finding narrative arcs in the data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. The Axar Patel article took about two to three weeks from conception to writing, as the data revealed many anomalous patterns that made narrative construction straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. This specific piece was not published on Crickinfo due to uncertainty about using Hawkeye data, so Ganjoo released it on his Substack, where it gained significant traction with thousands of likes on Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

Ganjoo considers this article one of his most impactful in terms of public visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. He believes it was a "seminal piece" in understanding cricket, as it demonstrated a new "prism into the game" using public Hawkeye data, allowing for rigorous, data-backed insights beyond traditional clichés <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.

## Joining the Indian Men's Cricket Team

### The Invitation from Rahul Dravid
Ganjoo's work caught the attention of [[indias_cricket_team_transition_postKohli | Rahul Dravid]], then the coach of the [[indias_cricket_team_transition_postKohli | Indian team]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>. Dravid, known for his curiosity and forward-thinking approach to T20 cricket, contacted Ganjoo via email in April 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>. Ganjoo initially thought the email was a prank due to its politeness, confirming its authenticity with Rajesh at Crickinfo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>.

Their initial conversations focused on how Ganjoo analyzed the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>. Dravid was particularly interested in leveraging tracking data to better understand bowlers and batters, an area where Ganjoo felt the team was not fully utilizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>. Within one to two months, a formal plan was established for Ganjoo to join as a consultant analyst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>.

### Operating as a "Shadow Analyst"
Ganjoo's role with the [[indias_cricket_team_transition_postKohli | Indian team]] was kept private, partly due to the high-profile, high-risk nature of the job and the desire to minimize external "noise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>. As a semi-public figure on Twitter, public knowledge of his role could lead to unwanted inquiries or information leaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>. He found the BCCI to be flexible and helpful once they became comfortable with him, providing most of the core data he needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>.

His primary mode of operation was to communicate his research and insights to the coaches, who would then decide how to convey this information to the players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>. This approach was deemed wise to avoid "muddling the players with numbers or with research" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>. Consequently, Ganjoo did not travel with the team nor directly interact with most players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>. The only players he regularly spoke with were [[rohit_sharmas_test_career_and_performance_analysis | Rohit Sharma]] (the captain) and Ravichandran Ashwin, the latter due to a previous article Ganjoo had written about him and Ashwin's analytical interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a>.

## Experiences and Challenges

Working with the [[indias_cricket_team_transition_postKohli | Indian team]] was a "scary" experience due to the immense public scrutiny and millions of watching fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:19">[00:28:19]</a>. Ganjoo learned to detach emotionally from wins and losses, recognizing that players are accustomed to the daily cycles of success and failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>. As an analyst, he experienced the "powerlessness" of having his plans perfectly laid out, only for external factors (like pitch conditions or dropped catches) to influence outcomes beyond his control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>.

Before the ODI World Cup, he consciously decided to "cut himself off" by sending his research a day or two before each game, then shutting down and not watching the matches live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:28">[00:38:28]</a>. This allowed him to maintain emotional distance, understanding that once the match began, his role was limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>. He estimates that approximately 30% of his plans were adopted by the team, and seeing those plans unfold on TV brought immense satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a>.

### 2024 T20 World Cup Victory
The pinnacle of his experience came with the [[indias_cricket_team_transition_postKohli | Indian team]]'s victory in the 2024 T20 World Cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:48">[00:44:48]</a>. Ganjoo credits the win to a collective effort, highlighting the successful execution of strategies developed over two and a half years under [[indias_cricket_team_transition_postKohli | Rahul Dravid]]'s leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:34">[00:43:34]</a>. He specifically recalls the wicket of Heinrich Klaasen in the final, where a previously discussed "white slower ball" delivery option was used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:37">[00:43:37]</a>.

Ganjoo considers his role as part of a "machine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:22">[00:44:22]</a>. The feeling of contributing to something so significant and moving is "unparalleled satisfaction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>. He expresses pride in the management's commitment to playing the game "the right way" through strategic moves and data-driven decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:32">[00:45:32]</a>. He acknowledges that luck played a role in the World Cup victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:48">[00:44:48]</a>.

## Impact and Reflections

Ganjoo believes his biggest contribution was helping to "change the culture" within the team, fostering a commitment to leveraging data for everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:22">[00:49:22]</a>. The balance between data and "vibes" was crucial, with [[rohit_sharmas_test_career_and_performance_analysis | Rohit Sharma]] and [[indias_cricket_team_transition_postKohli | Rahul Dravid]] understanding cricket deeply enough to integrate both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:32">[00:49:32]</a>. The team's dedication to being the "most knowledgeable Team Management out there" and knowing every possible detail about players, angles, and shots, was a source of great pride for Ganjoo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:21">[00:50:21]</a>.

The experience of having legendary cricketers like [[rohit_sharmas_test_career_and_performance_analysis | Rohit Sharma]] and [[indias_cricket_team_transition_postKohli | Rahul Dravid]] treat him as an equal and find his insights useful, despite him being a "hobbyist" and not a formal cricketer, was a profound source of satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a>. It affirmed the utility of his work beyond theoretical analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:34">[00:41:34]</a>.

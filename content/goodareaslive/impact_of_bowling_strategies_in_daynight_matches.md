The conditions in day-night matches can significantly influence bowling strategies and player performance, particularly regarding how the ball behaves under lights and with increased moisture [13:40]. This can lead to different approaches for bowlers and can even affect the batting averages of specific players.

## Mohammed Shami's Performance

Mohammed Shami was highlighted for his magnificent bowling, describing him as a "ridiculous weapon to have on your bench" [02:33, 02:48]. He possesses the best strike rate in World Cup history among bowlers with a minimum of 20 wickets, taking 36 wickets in just 12 matches [03:13, 03:44]. Shami's effectiveness stems from his ability to move the ball in both directions (swing and seam) while maintaining pace, and he has added "smarts as a bowler" in the one-day format [05:41, 05:53]. His spell against New Zealand was credited with shifting the game "massively in favor of India" [02:05].

## Indian Bowling Attack

India's bowling attack is noted for its depth, featuring five, or even six with Hardik Pandya, [[Indias bowling strategies and performance | strike bowlers]] [07:06, 07:08]. This allows them to consistently threaten wickets by "just bowling normally" rather than needing to "manufacture wickets" with "weird fields or weird plans" like some other teams [07:20, 07:33].

### Siraj's Approach

Siraj, seen as a wicket-taker by India, bowled more conventionally in a recent match, focusing on his natural length rather than overtly pushing for wickets [15:48, 15:55]. This highlights the Indian bowlers' ability to take wickets even when bowling defensively [16:06]. Siraj's normal length is considered threatening, and he doesn't need to bowl fuller to be effective [16:11]. He achieved his second-best economy rate of the tournament against strong batting lineups like Australia and New Zealand [16:18]. His ability to bowl over the wicket to left-handers, particularly against a batter like Conway who prefers the ball moving away, demonstrates strategic adaptability [17:03]. As a bowler who uses the wobble ball and hits the deck hard, he is not typically required to over-pitch [19:04].

### Jasprit Bumrah's Economy

Jasprit Bumrah is recognized as the most economical bowler in the power play during the current tournament [17:58]. His accuracy and ability to bowl "perfect lengths" from over the wicket consistently put pressure on batters like Conway [19:22, 19:31].

## New Zealand's Bowling Strength

New Zealand's bowling has significantly improved, with their bowlers' averages dropping closer to the World Cup [26:07, 26:09]. Their strength lies in having four frontline bowlers—Matt Henry, Trent Boult, Mitchell Santner, and Lockie Ferguson—who can all take wickets [27:39]. Mitchell Santner, in particular, is the leading wicket-taker in the tournament [27:12, 27:15]. While their fifth bowler might not be as strong as India's, the wicket-taking ability of their top four allows them to strategically manage the later overs of an innings [27:43, 27:50]. This also enables them to take calculated risks, sometimes using non-specialist bowlers like Daryl Mitchell and Rachin Ravindra at the death, as part of their overall game plan [27:58].

## Impact of Day-Night Conditions on Batting

The discussion around [[Impact of daynight test matches | day-night matches]] extends to how conditions can favor certain batters, specifically Virat Kohli. His batting average shows a significant increase when chasing in day-night matches compared to day matches [13:14]. This suggests that the ball "sliding on a little bit more at night," potentially due to moisture in the air common in places like Asia, suits his batting style [13:40]. Kohli, known for liking extra pace (as seen in his performances in Australia), seems to benefit from these conditions where the ball comes onto the bat differently [13:50, 13:52]. His strike rate also shows a notable increase during day-night chases, further supporting the idea that he prefers the way the ball behaves under lights [14:16, 14:23].

This phenomenon, where players might prefer batting in day-night conditions due to how the ball comes onto the bat, is a factor that could be explored further to understand its broader [[comparison_of_bowling_skills_and_strategies | impact on player performance]] in limited-overs cricket [14:49, 14:52].

## Strategic Adjustments Based on Conditions

The potential to make team changes based on the toss result or the type of match (day vs. day-night) is also considered [13:14, 13:20, 13:29, 13:34, 13:37, 13:40, 13:50, 13:57, 14:02, 14:05, 14:16,

16:27, 16:29, 16:31, 16:33, 16:35, 16:36, 16:40, 16:42, 16:43, 16:45, 16:46, 16:47, 16:49, 16:51, 16:52, 16:53, 16:56, 16:58, 17:01, 17:03, 17:04, 17:07, 17:12, 17:13, 17:16, 17:19, 17:22, 17:23,

For instance, in day-night matches, certain venues might see spinners struggle due to dew, prompting a team to reduce their spin options or change the type of spinners they use [59:25, 59:28, 59:31, 59:38, 59:41]. Similarly, if bowling in the second innings under lights, teams might prefer swing bowlers over hit-the-pitch or change-of-pace bowlers, as the ball can sometimes swing more in these conditions [1:00:00, 1:00:07, 1:00:11]. This suggests a nuanced [[comparison_of_bowling_strategies_and_patterns | approach to team selection]] based on specific match conditions.

This article discusses the selection process and individual matchups from "Good Areas Knockout Episode 2," focusing on the greatest One Day International (ODI) bowlers of all time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Methodology for Selecting GOAT ODI Bowlers

The process began by identifying the top 64 best ODI bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. A key challenge was comparing pace and spin bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The approach involved selecting the best 20 spinners first, then filling the remaining spots with pace bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

[[criteria_for_evaluating_odi_bowlers | Bowler evaluations]] used adjusted stats, comparing individual bowlers to their era and normalizing those stats to the current era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This assumes that if a bowler was 20% better than their era, they would remain 20% better in the current era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The initial draw was ranked and seeded to be fairer than previous episodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. For pacers, a minimum of 146 wickets was generally required for inclusion, though some pacers with 100-146 wickets were added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

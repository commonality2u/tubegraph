India secured a commanding 280-run victory over Bangladesh in the first Test in Chennai, a result largely anticipated, but one that saw India in a challenging position on day one before a crucial partnership turned the tide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Bangladesh had reduced India to 144 for six, creating a moment where they might have dared to dream of bowling India out below 200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. However, the subsequent [[r_ashwin_and_ravindra_jadeja_batting_partnership | R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja batting partnership]] ensured India never looked back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Ravichandran Ashwin's All-Round Masterclass

[[ravi_chandran_ashwins_cricket_legacy | Ravi Chandra Ashwin]], playing as the hometown hero in Chennai, delivered a phenomenal performance that earned him the Player of the Match award <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
His contributions included:
*   **Batting:** He scored a very brisk 113 runs, his sixth Test hundred, which placed him level with MS Dhoni <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This knock released pressure and was crucial in saving the game in the first innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Ashwin adopted an aggressive approach, realizing that the Bangladesh spinners were too slow on the wicket, which led to their lines and lengths being all over the place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. He consistently pushed the ball through gaps against fast bowlers and capitalized on deliveries down the leg side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
*   **Bowling:** He followed his century with an impressive spell of 6 for 88 in the fourth innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

Ashwin is considered by some commentators to be the best batter among all bowlers with over 400 or 500 Test wickets, placing him in rare company alongside players like Shane Warne, Kapil Dev, Richard Hadlee, and Shaun Pollock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. His batting ability is seen as a "huge bonus" to his primary skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. He has frequently bailed India out at home with the bat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. His overall performance marks him as a "borderline all-rounder" due to his clutch knocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. In India and potentially all of Asia, he is regarded as an all-rounder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

Ashwin's home Test batting average is 40.6, paired with a bowling average of 20.76 in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:09">[01:06:09]</a>. When compared to [[performance_and_role_of_ravi_ashwin_in_test_cricket | Anil Kumble]] as India's best spinner, Ashwin is seen as having more skill, a natural progression in modern cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:47">[01:11:47]</a>. While Kumble's away record provides a higher floor, Ashwin's higher ceiling suggests he is a superior talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:42">[01:47:42]</a>. Among bowlers with over 500 Test wickets, Ashwin is ranked highly, generally considered above Stuart Broad and Nathan Lyon, and in a similar tier to Jimmy Anderson and Courtney Walsh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:14">[01:18:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:33">[01:48:33]</a>.

## Ravindra Jadeja's Consistent Brilliance

[[ravi_jadejas_batting_performance_and_strategy | Ravindra Jadeja]] is described as a "ridiculous player" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. His ability to blunt opposition bowling on difficult wickets is highlighted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. His batting strategy is described as "Zen batting," focusing on blocking good balls and punishing bad ones to tire out bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

His performance in the Test included:
*   **Batting:** Scored 86 runs in the first innings, contributing significantly to India's rescue act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.
*   **Bowling:** Took five wickets in the Test match overall, including 3 for 58 in the fourth innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

Jadeja is one of only three players in Test cricket history to average over 35 with the bat and below 25 with the ball, joining the ranks of Imran Khan and Keith Miller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. His batting style is compared to Imran Khan's in its focused nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. Despite early criticism and jokes about his batting, Jadeja has developed a method that works for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:15">[01:13:15]</a>. He is also noted for being one of the best cricket athletes of his time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:26">[01:14:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:28">[01:14:28]</a>.

Jadeja's home Test batting average is 40.6, and his bowling average in India is 20.76 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:09">[01:06:09]</a>. A key concern regarding his career is the number of Tests he has missed; he has missed 40 Tests for India since his debut, often due to injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:42">[01:14:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:33">[01:34:33]</a>. Despite this, when he is in the side, he consistently performs at a high level, cementing his status as one of the best all-rounders in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:55">[01:15:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:46">[01:15:46]</a>.

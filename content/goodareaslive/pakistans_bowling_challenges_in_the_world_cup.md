Pakistan faced significant [[pakistans_cricket_strategy_and_performance_issues | challenges]] with their bowling attack during their match, contributing to their loss against India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The game was effectively over after Pakistan's batting collapse, as their bowlers never looked likely to make it a contest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Overall Performance and Wicket-Taking Issues

Despite their economy rate being "fine" (meaning not unexpectedly high for their aggressive approach), Pakistan's primary [[role_of_pakistans_bowling_and_fielding_in_the_match | bowling challenge]] was their inability to take wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. Historically, the best Pakistan teams combined par batting scores with bowlers who made those targets "ridiculously hard" to chase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>. Currently, the team's bowlers are not seen as good enough, necessitating that the batters score above par <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.

## Lack of Strategic Depth

A major concern for Pakistan's bowling attack is its one-dimensional nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:19">[00:28:19]</a>. When their primary plans—such as swing or wobble ball—failed, they lacked effective alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.

### Individual Bowler Struggles
*   **Shaheen Afridi**: His performance has been questioned, with observations that he doesn't seem 100% fit and the ball isn't coming out with his usual energy or pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>. He is considered a "one-dimensional bowler" who is very good at what he does but lacks the variety of options seen in other top bowlers like Trent Boult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>.
*   **Hassan Ali**: He struggled when the ball didn't seam, indicating a reliance on movement off the straight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>.
*   **Haris Rauf**: He appeared "a little bit lost early on," suggesting he prefers an older ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.
*   **Absence of Naseem Shah**: The team deeply felt the absence of Naseem Shah, who is described as an "absolutely incredible bowler." His presence might have given Pakistan a 20% chance in the match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.

## Pitch Conditions

The wicket itself offered "very little" for bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. While the pitch keeping "a little bit low" and inconsistently might have helped India's attack (known for attacking the stumps) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>, it did not favor Pakistan's style of bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.

## Contrast with Indian Bowling

India's bowling unit, particularly their all-rounders, highlighted Pakistan's deficiencies.
*   **Ravindra Jadeja and Hardik Pandya**: Their combined performance (4 for 72 from 15.5 overs) showcased a depth Pakistan lacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. Hardik Pandya is noted as the strongest sixth bowler in the World Cup, and Ravindra Jadeja is arguably the strongest fifth bowler outside of South Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. This combination of strong all-rounders is a significant advantage for India, allowing them to compensate if a bowler like Shardul Thakur is ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.
*   **Indian Bowlers' Approach**: Indian bowlers, including Jasprit Bumrah, Kuldeep Yadav, and Ravindra Jadeja, are adept at attacking the stumps, a skill that can be particularly effective on wickets with inconsistent bounce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
*   **Kuldeep Yadav's Dominance**: Kuldeep Yadav has an "extraordinarily low" bowling average against Pakistan, having taken 12 wickets in six games against them in multi-team tournaments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. Even against a skilled player of spin like Saud Shakeel, Kuldeep was able to beat him with flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
*   **Jasprit Bumrah's Off-Cutter**: Bumrah's ability to deliver an "off-spinner at 80 mph" that moves significantly off the wicket, even hitting the top of off stump after pitching wide, demonstrates a variation and quality that Pakistan's bowlers struggled to replicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

Ultimately, Pakistan's bowling attack struggled with a lack of varied options, inconsistent form from key bowlers, and the absence of a strong third fast-bowling option, especially on a flat wicket that offered little assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.

## Overview of Performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>
Early in the match, the [[Performance Analysis of Bangladesh Cricket Team | Bangladesh]] bowlers showed promise, particularly in the first two sessions. However, their performance seemed to wane, with the team electing not to "play" in the final session, allowing the Indian batters to dominate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This drop-off could be attributed to fatigue and the ball softening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

### Strategic and Run Rate Analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>
[[Performance Analysis of Bangladesh Cricket Team | Bangladesh]] was attacking early on, conceding 3.8 runs an over in the first session while facing aggressive batters like Jurel and Pant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. They managed to maintain pressure in the second session, with the run rate dipping to 3.5, partly due to taking wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. However, the run rate then surged to 5 in the final session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. A key factor was their slow over-rate, bowling only 4 overs in the first session and 7 in the second, forcing them to bowl the majority of the day's overs in the last session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. This put them in a difficult situation as batting becomes easier once the ball softens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

## Seam Bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>

### Hassan Mahmud's Impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>
Hassan Mahmud bowled very well, wobbling the ball and creating sideways movement early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. His unpredictable wobble ball makes him a "pain in the ass" for batters, as he can seam it both ways, often moving it away more than in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>. While he consistently gets about one degree of seam movement when moving it away, he can get dramatic movement when seaming it in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>. This variation leaves batters unsure of the ball's direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>.

### Other Seamers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>
[[Performance Analysis of Bangladesh Cricket Team | Bangladesh]] proved they have more than one seam option available, with Naheed Rana also hitting Ashwin on the badge, despite some wides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. The energy off the wicket, even later in the day, allowed the keeper to take the ball quite hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

### Seam Length Strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>
[[Performance Analysis of Bangladesh Cricket Team | Bangladesh]] seamers had success bowling at a length of 7 to 8 meters, averaging just under 20 runs per wicket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>. This length is considered between a good length and back of a length in modern cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>. Other lengths were not as effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>.

## Spin Bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:47">[00:27:47]</a>

### Speed and Effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>
[[Performance Analysis of Bangladesh Cricket Team | Bangladesh]] spinners primarily bowled at a pace between 81 and 90 km/h, with a small percentage (1.7%) over 90 km/h <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:37">[00:28:37]</a>. In India, spinners bowling at speeds between 81-90 km/h average significantly better (around 25) compared to those bowling 71-80 km/h (average around 35) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>. This suggests that a quicker, more "direct" pace is effective on Indian spin wickets due to slower pitches when spinning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>.

### Length Strategy for Spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>
[[Performance Analysis of Bangladesh Cricket Team | Bangladesh]] spinners were observed to overpitch and underpitch too often <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>. The ideal length in Test cricket is generally 4 to 5 meters, forcing Indian batters to use their feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a>. Deliveries that are "step and fetch" (requiring a big stride but no footwork) are the worst to bowl, as batters can make good contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a>. For example, Shakib's first ball was too short and down the leg side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">[00:33:17]</a>.

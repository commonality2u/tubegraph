Rashid Khan, a prominent leg-spinner, has faced notable challenges and a dip in performance in recent times, particularly highlighted during the IPL. Analysts point to a combination of tactical shifts, confidence issues, and evolving batter strategies as contributing factors to his current form.

## Performance Analysis

While Rashid Khan showcased strong performances in other tournaments, his IPL numbers have seen a significant decline:
*   **SA20:** He took 12 wickets at an average of 21.5 and an economy rate of 7 runs per over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.
*   **IPL 2023:** He secured 10 wickets at an average of 36 with an economy of 8.4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.
*   **Current IPL Season:** His performance has dropped considerably, with only one wicket in three matches at an average of 112 and an economy rate of 11 runs per over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.

Further analysis reveals technical and tactical issues:
*   His bowling length is reportedly 40cm shorter than it used to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>.
*   He is struggling with both length and line, frequently bowling too short, too wide, or down the leg side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>.
*   There's a noticeable lack of control with the ball coming out of his hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.

## Contributing Challenges

### Change in Role and Team Strategy
One significant factor identified is the change in how Rashid Khan is being utilized by his team.
*   He is often brought into the attack later in the innings, sometimes as late as the 13th over, and is increasingly used as a death bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>.
*   This shift to a more defensive option is believed to impact his mentality and psyche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>.
*   It is suggested that a match-winner like Rashid Khan should be introduced earlier, ideally in the 7th or 8th over, or bowl in two distinct spells (e.g., overs 7-9 and 17-19) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>.

### Confidence and Rhythm
Sport is inherently a confidence game, and Rashid Khan's current struggles may stem from a lack of confidence and rhythm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>.
*   Not performing well in early games can compound confidence issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>.
*   His pace has reportedly slowed, which could be a rhythm issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>.
*   He appears "stiff," and the ball is not coming out of his hand correctly, suggesting a physical or mental blockage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. This could be related to a back injury he has been recovering from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a>.

### Evolving Batter Approaches
Batters are no longer as apprehensive about facing Rashid Khan as they once were <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:12">[00:30:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a>.
*   They are more willing to attack him, pouncing on every mistake rather than playing cautiously to preserve their wicket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>.
*   The "impact player" rule in the IPL has encouraged batters to go "hammer and tongs" regardless of the bowler, maximizing opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:20">[00:31:20]</a>.
*   Batters are now effectively sweeping him, a shot that was previously less effective due to his lack of bounce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:59">[00:32:59]</a>.

Despite these challenges, there's optimism that Rashid Khan will return to form, but it may require a period of consistent play to regain his rhythm and confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>. He is still considered a "fierce competitor" who "has to win every moment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>.

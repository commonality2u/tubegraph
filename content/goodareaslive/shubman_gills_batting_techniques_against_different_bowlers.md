Cricket analyst Jared Kimber discusses the evolution of [[shubman_gills_batting_performance_in_different_innings | Shubman Gill's]] batting in Test cricket, particularly contrasting his performance against different bowling types and specific bowlers with his One-Day International (ODI) form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>.

## Historical Performance (Before This Series)

Before the current series, [[shubman_gills_batting_performance_in_different_innings | Shubman Gill's]] Test cricket averages against both pace and spin were "terrible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:00]</a>. This was in stark contrast to his ODI statistics, where he averaged 57 against pace and 80 against spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>. Kimber notes that this disparity made little sense, as Gill was not trapped on worse wickets than other players like Jaiswal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>.

## Current Series Performance

In the ongoing series, [[shubman_gills_batting_performance_in_different_innings | Gill's]] performance significantly improved, reflecting his white-ball capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>.
*   **Against Pace:** He averaged 43 against pace in this series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>. This improvement against pace is possibly influenced by the England seamers not bowling particularly well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:03:00">[13:03:00]</a>.
*   **Against Spin:** His average against spin surged to 80 in this series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>, matching his ODI numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:00">[10:43:00]</a>. This turnaround is attributed to Gill's own improvement against spin rather than external factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:00">[13:11:00]</a>. The shift is considered more of a mental adjustment than a technical one, although he might be using his feet slightly better to spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a>.

## Facing High Pace Bowling

Before today's play, [[shubman_gills_batting_performance_in_different_innings | Gill's]] record against balls at 88 miles per hour and quicker showed a significant difference between formats: he averaged 55 in ODIs but only 23 in Test matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:29:00">[13:29:00]</a>. However, watching him bat against 88 mph+ bowling today suggests there is "absolutely no issue with it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:23:00">[14:23:00]</a>. While there was speculation that extra slips might have contributed to his low average, his caught-at-slip ratio was not particularly high, indicating it might have been "dumb luck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05:00">[14:05:00]</a>.

## Confrontation with James Anderson

James Anderson has historically had considerable success against [[shubman_gills_batting_performance_in_different_innings | Shubman Gill]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>. Before this series, Gill averaged 7.75 against Anderson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:00">[14:41:00]</a>. In the current series, he managed to raise that average to 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:45:00">[14:45:00]</a>. Anderson's past success likely fueled his willingness to sledge Gill when he was in his 90s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:53:00">[14:53:00]</a>.

## Performance at Number Three

Shifting to bat at number three was a significant narrative point for [[shubman_gills_batting_performance_in_different_innings | Gill]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:00">[15:01:00]</a>. Prior to this series, he averaged 23 at this position. However, in the current series, his average at number three improved to 56 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:06:00">[15:06:00]</a>. He has looked "a lot better" and like the expected [[shubman_gills_batting_performance_in_different_innings | Shubman Gill]] since an innings in the third or fourth match of the series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:00">[15:21:00]</a>.

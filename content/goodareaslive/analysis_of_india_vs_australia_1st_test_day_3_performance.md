The bowling average for Day 3 was 36.33, contrasting sharply with Day 1's and Day 2's average of 12.76 and 69.67 respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. The pitch, described as "magnificently weird," showed pace again on Day 3 after slowing down on Day 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

## India's Performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>

[[India vs Australia Test Cricket Analysis | India]] performed well on Day 3, managing not to lose too many wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

### Batting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>

*   **Yashasvi Jaiswal**: Jaiswal continued his impressive form, making another "daddy" hundred, consistently scoring big once he reaches triple figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. His first-class career shows a pattern of making large scores (e.g., 103, 100, 144) after his initial failures, indicating a strong ability to bat on and convert centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. He averages 72 when the ball is bowled straight to him, but this drops to 29 when there's an angle or it's wide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. His ability to rotate strike effectively is highlighted, with his strike rotation average being more than double that of other openers in the last three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   **Virat Kohli**: Kohli looked "much more settled at the crease" on Day 3, striking the ball with ease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. He moved his batting position from off-stump to leg-stump, a decision believed to be better for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. Kohli has an exceptional "match factor" in [[Australia vs India 4th Test match analysis | Australia]] and thrives when the ball comes onto the bat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. He is among the top away batters with the most centuries in [[Australia vs India 4th Test match analysis | Australia]], alongside W. Hammond and Jack Hobbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. Notably, Kohli played a reverse sweep on Day 3, a shot he has rarely attempted (19 times in 3,645 instances against spin bowlers across formats in the database) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. This indicates a more "malleable" and team-oriented approach to his batting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.
*   **KL Rahul & Dev Padikkal**: KL Rahul had an "important knock," while Dev Padikkal poked one into the cordon again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. KL Rahul's dismissal in the first innings was described as "a bit of a dodgy one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>.
*   **Team Score**: [[India vs Australia Test Cricket Analysis | India]] posted a high team score against [[Australia vs India 4th Test match analysis | Australia]] under Pat Cummins, which is a significant step up compared to previous matches where teams generally haven't made many runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

### Bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>

*   **Jasprit Bumrah**: Bumrah's bowling average in [[Australia vs India 4th Test match analysis | Australia]] in overs 1-20 is exceptional, making him one of the best new ball bowlers in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. He "seemed to work out the... right length to bowl" against [[Australia vs India 4th Test match analysis | Australian]] batters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. His bowling average in Test Cricket has dropped to sub-20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>.
*   **Mohammed Siraj**: Siraj looked in "better rhythm" and, alongside Bumrah, proved to be a strong bowling attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>.

## Australia's Performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>

[[Australia vs India 4th Test match analysis | Australia]] were patient and bowled better on a more helpful wicket, but were ultimately stopped by Kohli's hundred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### Bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>

*   **General Strategy**: [[Australia vs India 4th Test match analysis | Australia]] bowled "a lot better," fuller, and more attacking, going for wickets for a long period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. However, once [[India vs Australia Test Cricket Analysis | India]] crossed 350-400 runs, it became difficult for any bowling team to dominate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>.
*   **Pat Cummins (Captaincy)**: Cummins is described as a pragmatic and patient captain who sticks to pre-approved plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>. While this approach has brought [[Australia vs India 4th Test match analysis | Australia]] success, critics argue he lacked the flexibility to "throw out the script" and bowl more aggressively (e.g., bouncers) earlier in the game when [[India vs Australia Test Cricket Analysis | India]] was getting away from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a>.
*   **Manus Labuschagne**: The decision to use [[batting_performance_analysis_of_india_and_australia | Manus Labuschagne]] as a "budget Neil Wagner" who bowled wide bouncers (and later wides on purpose) to slow down Virat Kohli, is seen as a "sign of dark times" for [[Australia vs India 4th Test match analysis | Australia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. He bowled "weird pace" as seamers were being shielded from "Wagner Duty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   **Mitchell Starc & Josh Hazlewood**: Starc's new ball bowling in the first innings was the best it has looked in some time, with good energy and swing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>. Hazlewood also had remarkable figures at one stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:42">[00:39:42]</a>.

### Batting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>

*   **Overall**: [[Australia vs India 4th Test match analysis | Australia]] came out to bat in the shadows, figuratively and literally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. The team's top four batting issues were identified as a significant weakness coming into the series, with concerns about Usman Khawaja's form, the suitability of Matt Renshaw as an opener, and the struggles of Manus Labuschagne and Steve Smith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>.
*   **Individual Dismissals**:
    *   One batter got one to keep low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
    *   Pat Cummins "sacrificed himself for no real reason" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
    *   [[batting_performance_analysis_of_india_and_australia | Manus Labuschagne]] left a ball that he would have missed even if he played it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This dismissal, with him falling over, was compared to Ricky Ponting's struggles before his retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>.
*   **Night Watchman Decision**: The decision to send out Pat Cummins as a night watchman early in the innings was criticized, as it seemed negative and unlikely to succeed against the new ball and the Indian bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>.

## Match Context and Outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>

*   The current state of the game suggests that [[Australia vs India 4th Test match analysis | Australia]]'s "small weaknesses" have been "massively exposed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>.
*   [[India vs Australia Test Cricket Analysis | India]] has "beautifully exploited" the conditions that went in their favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>.
*   Despite [[Australia vs India 4th Test match analysis | Australia]]'s historical strength in pink-ball cricket, the exposed flaws in their top four and potential issues with consistent short-ball bowling could impact the next Test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>.
*   [[Analysis of INDvBAN 1st Test Day 2 Performance | India]]'s confidence is expected to increase significantly after this performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>.
*   The domestic cricket system in [[Australia vs India 4th Test match analysis | Australia]] is struggling to produce high-quality batters, with a "missing generation of batting talent" and issues like result-oriented Shield pitches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:23">[00:53:23]</a>.

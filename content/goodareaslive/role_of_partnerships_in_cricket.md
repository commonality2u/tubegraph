Cricket is fundamentally about partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

### Strategic Batting Partnerships
In One Day International (ODI) cricket, the role of an anchor batter is significantly more useful than in Twenty20 (T20) cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:22">[01:13:22]</a>. This reflects the need for sustained innings building through partnerships.

During a match against South Africa:
*   Rohit Sharma "went nuts" at the start of India's innings, while Virat Kohli played the anchor role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   Kohli began his innings at a quick strike rate, well over a run a ball in the first 10 overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   He then slowed down significantly in the middle overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This strategic slowdown was likely because Kohli understood that 280 runs would be more than enough, especially with the cushion built early in the innings, and his priority was to ensure no further wickets were lost before the 35-over mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. This was also influenced by South Africa's historical inability to chase and India's strong bowling attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   Kohli's reluctance to kick on aggressively at the death, a surprising pattern, might have been due to his discomfort against spin bowling that turns away from him, particularly against bowlers like Keshav Maharaj <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   Shreyas Iyer's innings also demonstrated a strategic approach. He was likely instructed by Kohli to "chip it around" and play slowly because of the cushion India had established, acknowledging that the pitch conditions changed after 10 overs, making the ball grip and slow down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:05">[01:13:05]</a>. Iyer smartly chose which bowlers to attack, going after Marco Jansen and part-time bowlers, while treating main strike bowlers with respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:28">[01:17:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:40">[01:17:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:43">[01:17:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:54">[01:17:54]</a>.

### Team Composition and Flexibility
India's team is currently so strong that they could almost negate the contribution from positions seven and eight and still be undefeated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:28">[01:28:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:40">[01:41:40]</a>. This highlights their deep batting and bowling capabilities, reducing the dependence on specific partnerships in every match.

*   The team is considered better with Hardik Pandya due to the added balance and flexibility he provides, especially in case of injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>, <a class="yt-19:28">[00:19:28]</a>.
*   Suryakumar Yadav's role as a death hitter, akin to Liam Livingstone or David Miller, is crucial for scoring at "crazy rates" from the 35th over onwards, playing like it's a T20 game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>.
*   Ravindra Jadeja, despite recent form concerns, is recognized as one of the best number sevens in ODI history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>. His ability to double his average and strike rate in the World Cup demonstrates his capacity to contribute when needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>.

### Challenges for India in Knockout Matches
To avoid a loss in a semi-final or final, teams need to take early wickets against India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:06">[01:14:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:21">[01:14:21]</a>. Taking three wickets in the first 15 or 25 overs would have a significant impact, as India is not a team that bats deep down to eight, nine, or ten wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:53">[01:14:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:55">[01:14:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. This highlights the importance of breaking partnerships early to expose the lower order.
The Indian team is also aware that in finals, they might face situations requiring on-the-fly problem-solving when their initial plans don't work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:19">[01:16:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:26">[01:16:26]</a>. This suggests that the ability to adapt and form new strategies, including adapting partnerships, is key.

Overall, India's success in the World Cup has been attributed to their well-rounded team with few flaws, the excellent form of their players, and a willingness to play a more aggressive form of cricket compared to past tournaments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:11">[01:09:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:49">[01:09:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. This aggressive approach, combined with strategic partnerships, enables them to leverage their strengths.

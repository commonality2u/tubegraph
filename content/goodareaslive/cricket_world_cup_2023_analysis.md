## Match Summary: India vs. New Zealand Semi-Final
India secured a spot in the [[cricket_analysis_and_player_performance_in_odi_world_cup_2023 | World Cup]] final, winning their tenth consecutive match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:15">[02:22:15]</a>. Rohit Sharma won the toss and opted for an aggressive batting approach, aiming to beat New Zealand within the first 10 overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>. India posted a formidable score, nearly reaching 400 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:46">[01:30:46]</a>. New Zealand faced a challenging chase, particularly as the ball moved more under lights at Wankhede Stadium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:05">[01:35:05]</a>. Despite strong partnerships, especially between Kane Williamson and Daryl Mitchell, New Zealand ultimately fell short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:56">[02:12:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:03">[02:16:03]</a>.

## India's Performance

### Batting
India's batting approach in the [[cricket_analysis_and_player_performance_in_odi_world_cup_2023 | tournament]] emphasized "intent," with players scoring quicker and putting pressure on the opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:03">[06:11:03]</a>.

#### Rohit Sharma's Impact
Rohit Sharma's attacking style has been a defining difference for India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:35">[02:50:35]</a>. He holds the record for the most runs ever in a batting power play in [[cricket_analysis_and_player_performance_in_odi_world_cup_2023 | World Cup]] history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:49">[03:20:49]</a>. His approach of scoring at an average of 88.5 with 354 runs at eight runs an over in the power play is described as "absolutely ridiculous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:30">[04:51:30]</a>. This aggressive start sets a tone for the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:07">[06:23:07]</a>.

#### Power Play Dominance
India's openers score better than a run a ball in the first 10 overs of the [[cricket_analysis_and_player_performance_in_odi_world_cup_2023 | tournament]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:04">[04:33:04]</a>. India's batting average of 69, scoring more than a run a ball in the power play, provides a "huge advantage" over other teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:56">[05:20:56]</a>.

#### Individual Records
*   **Virat Kohli**: Became the player with the most hundreds ever in [[cricket_statistics_and_player_performances_in_world_cup_2023 | ODI cricket]] during this semi-final <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:44">[08:28:44]</a>. He is also second on the list of most international hundreds across all formats, behind Sachin Tendulkar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:41">[09:39:41]</a>. While he sometimes slows down for his century, his overall innings play is consistent with his role in the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:12:35">[31:12:35]</a>.
*   **Shreyas Iyer**: Passed an average of 50 in [[cricket_statistics_and_player_performances_in_world_cup_2023 | ODI cricket]] today, making him one of only a few players with 2,000 runs to achieve this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:00">[14:03:00]</a>. He is seen as a "wonderful cricketer" suited to Indian conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:38:58">[14:38:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:53">[14:40:53]</a>. His knock allowed Virat Kohli to play his preferred style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:52:13">[14:52:13]</a>.

#### Middle Overs Batting (Overs 30-40)
India tends to bat slower from overs 30 to 40, partly due to players approaching centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01:21">[16:01:21]</a>. Despite this, they maintain the highest average (almost 70) and score at 6.5 runs an over without losing wickets, operating from a "position of strength" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:40:34">[16:40:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:54:19">[16:54:19]</a>. This cautious approach is intentional, given concerns about the number eight batting position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:57:33">[16:57:33]</a>.

### Bowling
India's bowling attack has been exceptional throughout the [[cricket_analysis_and_player_performance_in_odi_world_cup_2023 | tournament]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:11">[10:02:11]</a>.

#### Mohammed Shami
Mohammed Shami's wicket-taking ability is highlighted, with wickets "following him around" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:53">[01:43:53]</a>. He took crucial early wickets in the semi-final, putting pressure on New Zealand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>. Shami holds the record for the lowest bowling average in the power play in [[cricket_analysis_and_player_performance_in_odi_world_cup_2023 | World Cup]] history (minimum five wickets and 60 balls), averaging 6.62 runs per wicket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:07">[13:07:07]</a>. His natural wobble on swinging balls provides him multiple ways to move the ball sideways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:30:46">[34:30:46]</a>. He is currently considered a "way better bowler" than in previous [[cricket_analysis_and_player_performance_in_odi_world_cup_2023 | World Cups]] (2015, 2019) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:28:13">[44:28:13]</a>.

#### Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj
[[analysis_of_fielding_and_boling_strategies_in_odi_cricket_during_the_world_cup_2023 | Jasprit Bumrah]] is praised for his skill, akin to a spinner, in extracting movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:07:07">[34:07:07]</a>. [[analysis_of_fielding_and_boling_strategies_in_odi_cricket_during_the_world_cup_2023 | Mohammed Siraj]] possesses an "incredible wobble ball" that deviates more than other bowlers' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:55:07">[33:55:07]</a>.

#### Power Play Bowling
India's bowlers have an average of 20 in the power play, which played a significant part in their victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:24">[12:18:24]</a>. They can bowl defensively while still taking wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:37">[11:37:37]</a>. A potential area for improvement is their relatively low slower ball percentage compared to other bowlers in the [[cricket_analysis_and_player_performance_in_odi_world_cup_2023 | World Cup]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:25:21">[17:25:21]</a>.

### Team Strength and Captaincy
India's team is described as having "no weak links" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:59:00">[40:59:00]</a>, with every player in form and contributing to the team's strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:07:34">[41:07:34]</a>. Rohit Sharma's captaincy is praised for fostering "role clarity" and adopting an "ultra-aggressive approach," setting an example for the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:37:39">[41:37:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:48:00">[41:48:00]</a>.

## New Zealand's Performance

### Batting
*   **Daryl Mitchell**: Played an "absolutely outstanding" innings until physically exhausted, showcasing his strength down the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:15:39">[23:15:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:08:44">[25:08:44]</a>. He has scored over 1,000 runs since his [[cricket_statistics_and_player_performances_in_world_cup_2023 | ODI career]] began in March 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:42:37">[23:42:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:49:03">[23:49:03]</a>. He is noted for his versatility in various formats and situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:01:23">[24:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:06:00">[32:06:00]</a>.
*   **Kane Williamson**: Despite an ACL tear and a broken thumb, he returned to play in the [[cricket_analysis_and_player_performance_in_odi_world_cup_2023 | World Cup]] and made significant contributions, stabilizing the innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:56:49">[25:56:49]</a>. He is known for getting caught at mid-on frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:45:00">[25:45:00]</a>. His partnership with Mitchell was crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:04:19">[23:04:19]</a>.

### Bowling
New Zealand used four different bowlers and made three bowling changes within the first 10 overs, indicating how India's aggressive batting disrupted their normal pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:16:30">[19:16:30]</a>. Their main new ball bowlers, Trent Boult and Tim Southee, were expensive early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:04:00">[20:04:00]</a>.

#### Fifth Bowler Weakness
New Zealand's "weak fifth bowler" is a recurring issue, which is difficult to absorb when other bowlers are struggling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:30:52">[20:30:52]</a>. For example, Glenn Phillips, often their best fifth bowler, went for 10 runs in an over, leading them to stop bowling him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:56:06">[20:56:06]</a>. This is particularly problematic against India, who average over 200 against off-spin in the [[cricket_analysis_and_player_performance_in_odi_world_cup_2023 | tournament]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:30:19">[21:30:19]</a>.

## General [[cricket_analysis_and_player_performance_in_odi_world_cup_2023 | World Cup]] Observations

### Home Nation Advantage
There's a trend of host nations winning the 50-over [[cricket_analysis_and_player_performance_in_odi_world_cup_2023 | World Cup]] since 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:32:00">[53:32:00]</a>. While some instances might be "dumb luck," it's also observed that the best teams are often hosting these [[cricket_analysis_and_player_performance_in_odi_world_cup_2023 | tournaments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:12:20">[54:12:20]</a>. Historically, hosting was seen as a disadvantage, but this has changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:25:00">[54:25:00]</a>.

### Pitch Conditions
The use of "used pitches" for major knockout games in [[cricket_analysis_and_player_performance_in_odi_world_cup_2023 | World Cups]] is considered unacceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:50:00">[29:50:00]</a>. While this specific pitch might not have played a significant part in the semi-final result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:04:00">[30:04:00]</a>, fresh pitches should always be used for such important matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:02:00">[30:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:26:00">[30:26:00]</a>. The ball moving more under lights is due to moisture around the wicket and humidity, making it harder for batters to pick the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:38:00">[35:38:00]</a>.

### Future of ODI Cricket
There's an expectation that the [[cricket_analysis_and_player_performance_in_odi_world_cup_2023 | ODI format]] will undergo a "revamp" after this [[cricket_analysis_and_player_performance_in_odi_world_cup_2023 | World Cup]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:24">[01:02:24]</a>. The format might evolve, potentially becoming 40-over games or significantly different from [[t20_world_cup_2024_final_match_analysis | T20 cricket]] to ensure its continued existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:29">[01:01:29]</a>.

### New Zealand's Golden Era
The discussion suggests that New Zealand's "Golden Era" in [[cricket_analysis_and_player_performance_in_odi_world_cup_2023 | cricket]] might be concluding, particularly with the retirement of Ross Taylor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:08:00">[45:08:00]</a>. While they continue to find new talent, key players like Tim Southee and Trent Boult are unlikely to play in another 50-over [[cricket_analysis_and_player_performance_in_odi_world_cup_2023 | World Cup]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:50:00">[44:50:00]</a>.

[[Ravi Jadeja]]'s batting performance in the recent match was described as "really interesting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a> due to his adaptable approach. He is seen as a key player offering flexibility to [[Indias batting and bowling strategies | India's strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

## Batting Style and Adaptation

[[Ravi Jadeja]]'s batting can be characterized by "rough gear changes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Initially, his strike rate was 66 until tea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, largely due to targeting left-arm finger spinners and capitalizing on poor bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. After tea, as England improved their lines and lengths, [[Ravi Jadeja]] adjusted his approach to focus on staying at the crease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>, which caused his half-century to take "forever to get" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

## Evolution of Batting Position

[[Ravi Jadeja]] has undergone several phases as a batter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>:
*   As a young player, he achieved triple hundreds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
*   He then batted lower down the order, initially struggling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>, followed by a "sloggy" phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   Currently, he is considered a "genuine probably number six" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, with the ability to bat at number five <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, and could return to number seven when Pant returns, further strengthening the side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   His batting position at home since 2008 shows stints at four and five, but predominantly at number six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Previously, before his batting "revolution," he typically batted at number eight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

### Impact as an All-Rounder
Elevating his batting position to number six provides a significant "flexibility" and "boost" to the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. This allows for the inclusion of extra spinners, such as [[performance_of_r_ashwin_and_r_jadeja | R Ashwin]] and Axar Patel, benefiting from their combined all-round talents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

## Statistical Improvement

[[Ravi Jadeja]]'s batting average at home improved significantly from 32 (2013-2017) to 57 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. While his scoring rate can be slow against off-spin and seam, he maintains a good strike rate against left-arm finger spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>, making him "unshiftable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. This success at a higher batting order ensures that England "weren't going to win it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

## Run-out Incident

During the match, [[Ravi Jadeja]] was involved in a run-out with [[R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja batting partnership | R Ashwin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
*   [[performance_and_role_of_ravi_ashwin_in_test_cricket | Ashwin]], on the back foot, pushed the ball to the offside and immediately looked for a run to the covers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
*   [[Ravi Jadeja]] was "a little bit slow to get going" despite [[performance_and_role_of_ravi_ashwin_in_test_cricket | Ashwin]]'s call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   [[Ravi Jadeja]] spent "a lot of his time looking at the field" rather than reacting to the call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
*   After looking at the fielder (Tom Hartley), [[Ravi Jadeja]] decided against the run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   [[performance_and_role_of_ravi_ashwin_in_test_cricket | Ashwin]] was already "halfway down the Wicket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
*   The ball went to the right-hand side of Tom Hartley, a left-hander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. [[performance_and_role_of_ravi_ashwin_in_test_cricket | Ashwin]] correctly assessed this as an opportunity for a run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.
*   [[Ravi Jadeja]], seeing the ball on the right-hand side of the fielder, didn't realize it was a left-hander and stopped, leading to [[performance_of_r_ashwin and r_jadeja | Ashwin]] being run out as [[Ravi Jadeja]] was on his way back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
*   The ironic humor of the situation is that [[Ravi Jadeja]] often achieves run-outs due to his left-handedness, but in this instance, a left-handed fielder contributed to him being run out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

Overall, [[Ravi Jadeja]]'s performance, especially his adaptability and improved role at number six, played a crucial part in [[Indias performance and strategies in Test Cricket | India]]'s strong position in the match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

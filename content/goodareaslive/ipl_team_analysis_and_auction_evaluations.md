From: [[goodareaslive]] <br/> 

The "never-ending [[ipl_auction_updates_and_player_strategies | IPL auction]]" has concluded, leading to an assessment of all ten teams and their strategies for the upcoming season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH)

The Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) have retained key players such as Heinrich Klaasen, Pat Cummins, Abhishek Sharma, Travis Head, and Nitish Kumar Reddy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

### Batting and Overall Strategy
SRH has focused on retaining their core from the previous season, emphasizing a "slogging" approach at the top of the order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **Opening Pair**: Abhishek Sharma and Travis Head are considered an "exhilarating opening pair" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Middle Order**: Heinrich Klaasen provides power in the middle, with Nitish Kumar Reddy expected to bat at three or four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Ishan Kishan was added, implying a continued focus on left-handers at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Batting Depth**: The team's batting order beyond the top five might face challenges, potentially lacking strong six and seven hitters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. However, Nitish Kumar Reddy could extend the batting to seven, with Pat Cummins at eight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

### Bowling Analysis
SRH has aimed to upgrade their bowling attack, which was a weakness last season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
*   **New Additions**: Harshal Patel, Rahul Chahar, Adam Zampa, and Brydon Carse were acquired, many at "discounted prices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   **Spin Options**: The acquisition of Zampa and Rahul Chahar addresses the previous lack of quality spinners, though both are leggies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   **Pace Attack**: If Mohammed Shami is fit, he offers better bowling at the top and bottom of the innings compared to Natarajan, who is no longer with the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Harshal Patel, despite a poor start last season, can be effective when opponents are chasing high totals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   **Overseas Players**: With Klaasen, Head, and Cummins as guaranteed overseas players, only one flexible spot remains, likely for Zampa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   **Prediction**: SRH is considered a playoff-bound team, provided their batting doesn't collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

## Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB)

RCB spent significantly on players like Josh Hazlewood, Phil Salt, Jitesh Sharma, and Liam Livingstone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

### Batting Concerns
RCB's main issue lies in its batting order, particularly the lack of a clear number three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.
*   **Top Order**: Virat Kohli, Phil Salt, and Devdutt Padikkal are options, but many players are suited for roles at 4, 5, or 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.
*   **Jitesh Sharma**: There's speculation he might be considered for the number three spot or as a replacement for Dinesh Karthik, but his optimal role might be different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.
*   **All-rounders**: Krunal Pandya is expected to play due to a perceived lack of other all-rounders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
*   **Power Hitting**: RCB's batting depth is questioned, especially with a potential lack of strong hitters at six and seven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>.

### Bowling Strengths and Weaknesses
*   **Pace Options**: Hazlewood and Akash Madhwal are considered strong new ball bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. However, there's concern that Hazlewood, Akash Madhwal, and Bhuvneshwar Kumar are similar bowlers who all need the new ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.
*   **Spin Options**: Krunal Pandya and Suyash Sharma are the primary spin options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. The Chinnaswamy Stadium pitch dictates that spinners need to be wicket-takers, not just containing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.
*   **Death Bowling**: Identifying their best death bowler is an area of concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.
*   **Overall**: The team's composition makes it difficult to assemble a balanced playing XI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.

## Punjab Kings (PBKS)

Punjab Kings are characterized as "The Wack house team of the IPL" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>.

### Auction Strategy and Player Values
*   **High Spends**: The team's decision to spend 26.75 crore on Shreyas Iyer, despite his anchor-batter role, is heavily criticized as an overpay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>. Spending 18 crores on Yuzvendra Chahal and then also paying more for Arshdeep Singh (after not retaining him) compounds the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:25">[00:26:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>.
*   **Value Picks**: Glenn Maxwell and Lockie Ferguson were acquired at "low" prices, which could be a boost if they perform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>. Josh Inglis was another good pick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>.
*   **Sandip Sharma**: His acquisition is seen as a "steal" due to his death bowling skills and relatively low price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.

### Team Composition
*   **All-rounders**: Punjab has an abundance of right-arm medium-pace all-rounders (Aaron Hardie, Marcus Stoinis, Marco Jansen, Omair Yousuf) leading to a potential "West Indies problem" of too many similar bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>.
*   **Batting Order**: The ideal opening partner for Prabhsimran Singh and the overall top order (Shreyas Iyer, Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Jitesh Sharma) is unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a>.
*   **Overall**: The team's quality is questioned, with few players being considered top-three in the league <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>. Punjab Kings are predicted to be a "weird spoiler team" due to their questionable squad construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:11">[00:33:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>.

## Mumbai Indians (MI)

Mumbai Indians' strength lies in their top five batters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:33">[00:33:33]</a>.

### Batting and Wicket-keeping
*   **Top Order**: The top five names, including Rohit Sharma, Ishan Kishan, Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma, and Hardik Pandya, are "insane" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:35">[00:33:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>.
*   **Wicket-keeper**: The team faces a significant concern regarding their wicket-keeping options, as Ryan Rickelton is an overseas player and Robin Minz, though highly praised by the owner, is largely untested in T20s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:15">[00:35:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:36:50]</a>. This reliance on an unproven keeper could lead to "horribly wrong" outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>.

### Bowling Attack
*   **New Ball**: Trent Boult is considered the "best early ball bowler in the competition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:49">[00:33:49]</a>. Deepak Chahar's inclusion means they have "doubled down on new ball bowling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:54">[00:33:54]</a>.
*   **Overall Pace**: With Jasprit Bumrah, Boult, and Chahar, Mumbai has a strong pace attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:22">[00:40:22]</a>. Bumrah, even if bowling later, is a potent wicket-taker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>.
*   **Spin Options**: Akeal Hosein is a decent option, and while Ganesh is untested, he has a good carrom ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:59">[00:33:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>.
*   **Prediction**: Despite past performance issues (even with Bumrah's great season), this Mumbai Indians team has a "shot at the playoffs" given its strengthened bowling lineup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:11">[00:39:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>.

## Lucknow Super Giants (LSG)

Lucknow Super Giants made significant signings including Rishabh Pant and Nicholas Pooran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:19">[00:41:19]</a>.

### Player Acquisitions and Team Vibe
*   **Key Signings**: Avesh Khan, David Miller, Mitchell Marsh, Aiden Markram, Shabaz Ahmed, and Mayank Yadav were acquired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:26">[00:41:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:32">[00:41:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>. Mitchell Marsh was a "decent price," despite his past IPL struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:42">[00:41:42]</a>.
*   **Controversial Pick**: The signing of Shamar Joseph is questioned as he's "untested in T20" and plays a similar role to Mayank Yadav, who has already proven his enforcer capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a>.
*   **Batting Order**: Aiden Markram is expected to open, given the lack of other Indian openers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:43">[00:44:43]</a>. Ayush Badoni's role remains unclear, though he is expected to start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:57">[00:42:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>. The middle order with Pooran and Pant is considered "golden" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:12">[00:43:12]</a>.
*   **Overseas Core**: The overseas core, including Marsh, Markram, Pooran, and Miller, is not seen as particularly strong, with Miller and Markram's recent form being a concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:59">[00:43:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>.
*   **Overall Impression**: The LSG squad is described as "weird looking" and lacking a clear "overall vibe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:18">[00:45:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:21">[00:45:21]</a>.

### Bowling Options
*   **Indian Bowling**: LSG has good Indian bowling options, including Mohsin Khan and Mayank Yadav for new ball duties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:45">[00:44:45]</a>.
*   **Depth**: The bowling feels "thin" and relies heavily on their Indian bowlers, as their overseas core isn't geared towards strong bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:49">[00:46:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>.
*   **Prediction**: It's debated whether LSG can be a playoff team, with some skepticism about their overall strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:33">[00:47:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>.

## Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR)

Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) retained Sunil Narine and Andre Russell, hoping they can still perform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:49">[00:47:49]</a>.

### Team Composition and Batting
*   **Core Players**: Narine and Russell are the established "big boys" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:49">[00:47:49]</a>. Rinku Singh is a critical finisher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>.
*   **Openers**: Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Quinton de Kock are options to open, with Sunil Narine also having opened in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:26">[00:50:26]</a>.
*   **Batting Order**: The batting order is highly flexible, making it difficult to predict a fixed lineup, which is seen as a strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:55">[00:50:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:02">[00:51:02]</a>. Venkatesh Iyer is a potential captain and plays at three or four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:33">[00:50:33]</a>.
*   **Depth**: KKR boasts "unreal" batting depth, especially with the impact sub rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:52">[00:51:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:54">[00:51:54]</a>.

### Bowling Attack
*   **Pace Options**: Anrich Nortje and Spencer Johnson are key pace additions, but their fitness and consistency are concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:11">[00:48:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>. Umran Malik was acquired as a "flyer" project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:35">[00:48:35]</a>.
*   **Death Bowling**: Rinku Singh is option number one for death bowling, while Dre Russell is a third option due to his high economy rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:15">[00:53:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:18">[00:53:18]</a>.
*   **Overall**: The team is considered to have a "solid team" and is a favorite for the playoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:33">[00:53:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:39">[00:53:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:44">[00:53:44]</a>.

## Gujarat Titans (GT)

Gujarat Titans have a strong bowling attack featuring Rashid Khan, Siraj, Kagiso Rabada, Prasidh Krishna, and Lockie Ferguson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:52">[00:53:52]</a>.

### Bowling Strengths
*   **Spin**: Rashid Khan and Washington Sundar form a solid spin attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:39">[00:55:39]</a>.
*   **Pace**: The team hopes for bounce-back years from Siraj and Rabada, complemented by Krishna and Coetzee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:54">[00:55:54]</a>. Ishant Sharma provides emergency backup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:02">[00:56:02]</a>.
*   **Overall**: The bowling attack is highly praised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:11">[01:00:11]</a>.

### Batting Considerations
*   **Core**: Shubman Gill, Jos Buttler, and Sai Sudharsan form the top three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:16">[00:56:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:20">[00:56:20]</a>.
*   **Anchors**: Gill and Sudharsan have a tendency to play anchor roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:22">[00:56:22]</a>.
*   **Power Hitters**: [[impact_of_ipl_batters | Glenn Phillips]] (acquired for 2 crore) and Sherfane Rutherford offer power-hitting options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:38">[00:56:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:04">[00:57:04]</a>.
*   **All-rounders**: Shahrukh Khan and Rahul Tewatia are listed as all-rounders, extending the batting depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:18">[00:58:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:07">[00:59:07]</a>.
*   **Overall**: GT is considered a mix of "old-fashioned T20 cricket and modern T20 Cricket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>.

## Delhi Capitals (DC)

Delhi Capitals have made strategic acquisitions at reasonable prices, including KL Rahul, Tristan Stubbs, and Harry Brook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:30">[01:00:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:36">[01:00:36]</a>.

### Batting and All-rounders
*   **Openers**: Jake Fraser-McGurk is seen as a potential "bargain buy" opener <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:38">[01:00:38]</a>.
*   **Middle Order**: Tristan Stubbs is expected to bat higher in the order this season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:31">[01:01:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:46">[01:01:46]</a>. KL Rahul is given freedom in his role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:35">[01:01:35]</a>.
*   **All-rounders**: The team has a strong contingent of local all-rounders, including Axar Patel and the returning Abdul Samad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:08">[01:01:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>.
*   **Depth**: Batting depth is a concern, with Axar Patel potentially batting as high as six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:41">[01:02:41]</a>.

### Bowling Attack
*   **Pace**: Mitchell Starc's current form could make him a strong new ball option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:14">[01:04:14]</a>. Mukesh Kumar and Mohit Sharma are reliable death bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:22">[01:04:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:51">[01:04:51]</a>. The team has the option for an all-left-arm bowling attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:17">[01:03:17]</a>.
*   **Spin**: Kuldeep Yadav is a key spin option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:19">[01:01:19]</a>.
*   **Overall**: DC could be a "wild card" team if their key players perform consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a>.

## Chennai Super Kings (CSK)

Chennai Super Kings (CSK) have maintained their core and made strategic acquisitions, notably Pathirana, Noor Ahmad, and Khalil Ahmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:05">[01:06:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:12">[01:06:12]</a>.

### Strategy and Pitch Conditions
*   **Home Advantage**: CSK's team composition suggests they are well-set up to win a high percentage of their home games, especially if the pitch aids spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:45">[01:07:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:52">[01:08:52]</a>.
*   **Spin Focus**: The acquisition of a left-arm wrist spinner (Noor Ahmad) and Ravichandran Ashwin indicates an expectation that the pitch will spin significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:16">[01:07:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:19">[01:07:19]</a>.

### Batting Lineup
*   **Anchor Batters**: Ruturaj Gaikwad and Devon Conway are expected to anchor the innings, especially against spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:33">[01:07:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:01">[01:11:01]</a>.
*   **Middle Order**: Shivam Dube is a key player at number four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:37">[01:10:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:53">[01:13:53]</a>. Sam Curran is expected to play as a batter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:40">[01:10:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:46">[01:14:46]</a>.
*   **Finishers**: Ravindra Jadeja and MS Dhoni will continue to play the finisher roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:57">[01:10:57]</a>.
*   **Power Hitting**: The team's batting depth is long, but concerns exist about a lack of power-hitting ability compared to past CSK sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:11">[01:12:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:36">[01:11:36]</a>.

### Bowling Attack
*   **New Ball**: Khalil Ahmed and Mukesh Choudhary are options for new ball bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:53">[01:07:53]</a>. Ashwin could also bowl with the new ball if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:10">[01:08:10]</a>.
*   **Death Bowling**: Pathirana is a key death bowler, cleaning up one end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:26">[01:08:26]</a>. Nathan Ellis and Sam Curran are also options for death overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:34">[01:08:34]</a>.
*   **Flexibility**: CSK has flexibility with overseas players, able to swap based on conditions (e.g., Rachin Ravindra for extra batting, Sam Curran for pace) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:09">[01:17:09]</a>.

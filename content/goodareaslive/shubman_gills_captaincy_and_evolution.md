Shubman Gill has been appointed as the new test captain for India, a decision that comes with both excitement and challenges for the young cricketer and the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:56">[06:21:56]</a>. While there was a preference for Jasprit Bumrah to take on the role, concerns about his availability for every game led to Gill's appointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:10">[06:35:10]</a>.

## Early Career and Obsession with Batting

Shubman Gill first entered the cricket scene with KKR, having excelled in under-19 cricket and winning the U19 World Cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:40">[07:02:40]</a>. He was initially a soft-spoken individual, but his obsession with batting was evident from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:40">[07:20:40]</a>. It is estimated he would face at least 800 balls in every practice session, an intensity that observers noted as significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>. This dedication highlights his deep enjoyment of the sport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>.

## Tremendous Evolution as a Cricketer and Human Being

Over six years, from 2018 to 2024, Gill has shown tremendous [[evolution of cricket strategies and player roles | evolution]] as both a cricketer and a human being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:70">[07:51:70]</a>. Despite being only 23 or 24, his maturity and clarity of thought suggest the wisdom of a 30-year-old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>. He has a clear vision for what he wants to achieve for Indian cricket, even before taking on captaincy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>. This clarity extends to his own [[shubman_gills_batting_techniques_against_different_bowlers | batting techniques against different bowlers]] and his ability to seamlessly transition between formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>.

## Captaincy Evolution in the IPL

His [[the impact of leadership changes in cricket teams | evolution as a captain]] in the Tata IPL has been significant, described as "chalk and cheese" between last year and this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.
Last year, he appeared unsure and like a "fish out of water," soaking up as much knowledge as he could <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>. This year, however, he has been notably assured in his calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>. His batting performance has remained unimpacted, consistently placing him among the top three run-getters in the IPL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>.

His intensity as a captain is similar to that of [[Virat Kohli]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:00">[09:45:00]</a>. He has demonstrated an ability to inspire performances and navigate through leadership challenges effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>.

## Leadership Style and Tactical Approach

Shubman Gill's tactical approach on the field is considered good and is expected to become even more nuanced over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>. He possesses the makings of a great captain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>.

However, from a fan's perspective, this transition marks a different road, as two huge personalities (Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma) are departing, and Gill is less known to the broader Indian public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a>. There are also some minor criticisms of his captaincy, such as occasionally getting the bowling order wrong at crucial moments or not fully utilizing bowlers like Sai Kishore when they are unplayable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:00">[12:31:00]</a>.

One notable aspect of his [[shubman_gills_batting_performance_in_different_innings | batting performance in different innings]] is his "third innings dominant" nature, indicating a need for more consistent run-scoring across all innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>. Despite this, there's confidence he will achieve consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>. His brand as a clean-cut individual will evolve as captaincy requires him to address controversial topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:00">[12:18:00]</a>.

### The Challenge of a New Team

Gill is leading a brand new side without strong pillars from the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>. The senior-most batter in the test squad, KL Rahul, was himself subject to conjecture about his fit in all three formats a year and a half ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>. This transition will take time to settle, and judgment of his captaincy should be reserved until then <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>.

The team has lost significant leadership experience with the departure of players like Ajinkya Rahane, Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, and Ravichandran Ashwin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26:00">[15:26:00]</a>. Gill will need to identify and build a leadership core around him, including players like KL Rahul, Jasprit Bumrah, and Ravindra Jadeja <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:08:00">[17:08:00]</a>.

### Power Dynamics with Gautam Gambhir

The current power dynamics in the team might see the coach, Gautam Gambhir, holding the most significant influence for the first time in a long while <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:46:00">[17:46:00]</a>. Gambhir is known for working well with younger players, building confidence and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:45:00">[18:45:00]</a>. He has a history of backing youngsters, as seen with Suryakumar Yadav, whom he made vice-captain at KKR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:04:00">[19:04:00]</a>. This dynamic suggests a complementary relationship between Gill and Gambhir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:30:00">[18:30:00]</a>.

## Upcoming Test Series Against England

Gill's first major test as captain will be the upcoming series in England, which is considered a "test by fire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:53:00">[19:53:00]</a>. The dry conditions in the UK this year could be favorable for an Asian nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:29:00">[20:29:00]</a>. However, the absence of Mohammad Shami makes England slight favorites or at least balances the odds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:02:00">[22:02:02]</a>.

## Proposed Batting Order

The suggested batting order for the test squad, with Shubman Gill as captain, is:
1.  Yashasvi Jaiswal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:21:00">[36:21:00]</a>
2.  Sai Sudharsan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:23:00">[36:23:00]</a>
3.  KL Rahul (due to experience and numbers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:58:00">[36:58:00]</a>
4.  Shubman Gill (who has moved on from wanting to open) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:39:00">[37:39:00]</a>
5.  Karun Nair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:30:00">[36:30:00]</a>
6.  Rishabh Pant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:33:00">[36:33:00]</a>
7.  Ravindra Jadeja <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:37:00">[36:37:00]</a>
8.  Nitish Kumar Reddy (as a fourth bowling option/all-rounder) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:37:00">[36:37:00]</a>
9.  Jasprit Bumrah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:41:00">[36:41:00]</a>
10. Prasidh Krishna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:41:00">[36:41:00]</a>
11. Mohammed Siraj <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:44:00">[36:44:00]</a>

An alternative opening option could be Abhimanyu Easwaran with KL Rahul at number three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:52:00">[36:52:00]</a>. While Sai Sudharsan has found success batting lower down in England, the preference is to have Gill and Rahul in the middle order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:07:00">[37:07:00]</a>.

Overall, the hope is for Shubman Gill to be given ample time to settle into his test captaincy role and to lead with evolution, inspiration, and inclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>.

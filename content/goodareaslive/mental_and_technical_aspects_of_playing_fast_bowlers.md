Playing fast bowlers requires a blend of mental fortitude, precise technical adjustments, and disciplined training. It is a constant battle against both the opposition and one's own fears and habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

## Evolution as a Batter
Early in his career, the speaker experienced a significant moment at Lord's when he was a senior player struggling in a Test match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. He was in good form and found batting "too easy" that day, which led to pushing too hard and getting out softly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. A stern conversation with Graeme Smith, though initially not well-received, was a crucial "wake-up call" to take more responsibility and understand game situations better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

### Natural Ability vs. Hard Work
While possessing a natural ability to hit the ball and being adept at ball sports, the speaker asserts that the game was never "easy" for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. He felt he struggled significantly with his [[cricket_strategies_and_player_techniques | technique]], particularly with his back lift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. At the highest level, raw talent is insufficient if [[cricket_strategies_and_player_techniques | technique]] is flawed, as opponents will exploit weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. A lot of hard work was done "behind closed doors" to overcome these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

## Technical Adjustments
The speaker spent four years in international cricket, until 2008, before feeling comfortable with his [[cricket_strategies_and_player_techniques | technique]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Key technical areas he worked on included:
*   **Back Lift** He struggled with his back lift going behind his back, akin to a golf swing or tennis rotation, rather than the more open stance required in cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. He had to force himself to get the bat out in front and keep his hands close to his body to get into the correct channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   **Footwork and Weight Distribution** He experimented with various foot movements, including back-and-across and standing still, and focused on weight distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   **Head Position** Issues with back lift often caused his head to fall over, which he needed to counter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
*   **Body Alignment** Learning to align his shoulder, knees, head, and toes, and allowing the ball to come into his zone before committing to a shot, was crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. This also required mental discipline to wait for the ball, especially against fast bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

### Playing Mitchell Johnson
Facing [[comparison_of_fast_bowlers_in_indian_cricket | Mitchell Johnson]] on a challenging Centurion wicket, where balls unpredictably flew or stayed low, highlighted his developed [[cricket_strategies_and_player_techniques | technique]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. He remembered being "quiet in his head" and feeling good about his [[cricket_strategies_and_player_techniques | technique]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. He found that the faster the bowler, the more you had to allow the ball to come to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. Playing the ball too early, "out of the bowler's hands," leads to being rushed and making wrong movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. When in good form, fast bowlers felt like they were "bowling underarms" because he could wait and avoid being rushed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

### Fast Hands
The speaker emphasizes the importance of "fast hands" to generate power while playing the ball late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. He trained by forcing himself to play balls late in the nets and using drills that restricted foot movement, which required explosive hand speed to generate power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. Playing other sports like tennis and hockey also contributed to this explosiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.

## Mental Aspect of Facing Pace
The mental battle is a [[bowler_performances_and_strategies | crucial part of the game]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   **Fear Factor** Against 90 mph bowling on fast pitches, there's always an underlying fear of being hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. This fear is significantly reduced on slower wickets where the ball can be allowed to bounce more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.
*   **Mental Battle** Batters constantly tell themselves to "go forward no matter what," even though thoughts of the short ball linger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. Growing up on fast wickets in South Africa helped, but he still trained extensively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.
*   **Training for Fear** He would train with Alan Donald, who would throw at speeds around 160 km/h with a stick, intentionally missing most balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. This unrealistic training helped prepare him for the real match scenario by conditioning him against the fear factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.
*   **Situational Awareness** He emphasizes the importance of understanding the game situation, the captain's strategy, and the scoreboard, then returning to one's own "bubble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>.

## Adaptability and Continuous Learning
The speaker never struggled to jump between formats (T20 to Test cricket), viewing it as a mental challenge to adapt to different situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. His best performances came when he focused on the situation rather than the format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>.

### Learning from Others
His ability to play spin well was not natural but developed through practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>. He actively picked up tips from other players, including Jacques Kallis, subcontinent players like Virender Sehwag, and even younger teammates like Heinrich Klaasen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>. This involved observing their approaches, practicing specific shots (like the sweep), and understanding nuances like hand position against spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. He reflects that his biggest strength was his adaptability and openness to learning and trying new things, even late in his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.

### Innate Impact and Desire
He attributes an "explosiveness out of nowhere" and a desire to have a big impact on the game as something he was "born with," often surprising even himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>. This characteristic, possibly stemming from his upbringing and values, instilled a mentality that "the game is never over until it's over" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>. He always respects bowlers but will go "absolutely flat out" or turn a game on its head if he senses an opportunity or weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>. This desire to "earn the right" to play freely and have fun was a core part of his batting philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>.

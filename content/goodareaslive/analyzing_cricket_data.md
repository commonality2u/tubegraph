Cricket data analysis involves understanding the nuances of the game through statistical investigation, moving beyond traditional perceptions and cliches to derive insights from detailed information like ball-by-ball data and tracking data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:42">[01:41:42]</a>. This approach aims to provide a "new prism into the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>, offering rigorous, data-backed windows into performance and strategies.

## Early Forays into Cricket Data
Himanish Ganju, a cosmologist and former analyst for the Indian men's cricket team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, began his journey into [[understanding_cricket_statistics | cricket data]] out of personal curiosity in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. While jobless and waiting to apply for grad school, he sought answers to basic questions like how batting averages had changed over time in Test cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Lacking the tools, he learned Python and how to gather [[analysis_of_historical_cricket_matches_and_records | data from various sources]] to build his own databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

## Key Analytical Works and Philosophy
Himanish's analytical process typically starts with a "triggering question," followed by formulating it into numbers and building metrics to investigate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Once data is gathered and code written, he seeks "arcs that you can put into stories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. This process usually takes three to four weeks from conception to final article <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

### The Akshar Patel Article
A seminal piece of work for Himanish was his article on cricketer Akshar Patel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Initially, Akshar Patel was perceived as "just another dotter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. However, after the 2021 England series, Himanish observed Patel bowling "very wide of the crease" and not turning the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This led him to investigate the data to understand why Patel was getting wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

The data revealed Akshar Patel to be "really different and really anomalous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The article, which took two to three weeks to complete due to the anomalous data, was eventually published on Substack because of uncertainties about using Hawkeye data for Cricinfo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. It gained significant traction, receiving "3-400 likes on Twitter," making it one of his most widely read pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

This article was deemed significant because it "changes the way that we think about how someone gets wickets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. It decoded a player's performance to a point where "you understood why Akshar Patel took wickets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>, moving beyond simple observations to explain the underlying mechanisms using [[advanced_data_analysis_in_cricket_including_ball_revolutions | Hawkeye data]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.

### Other Notable Works
Himanish is also proud of:
*   His first article for Cricinfo, which applied survival analysis to Test match batting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   A piece on boundary hitting in T20 cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

### Data Analysis Philosophy
Himanish emphasizes that [[cricket_strategies_and_game_analysis | analyzing cricket data]] requires both an understanding of the game and allowing the data to reveal answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. While the data should talk, it must be tempered with knowledge of the game because "the data isn't perfect, it doesn't capture everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. His approach is to follow where the numbers lead, rather than coming in with pre-existing perceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

## Role as Analyst for the Indian Men's Cricket Team
The Akshar Patel article played a crucial role in Himanish's eventual recruitment as a consultant analyst for the Indian men's cricket team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:12">[01:16:12]</a>. Rahul Dravid, the team's coach, saw a video based on the article and reached out in April 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:40">[01:16:40]</a>.

### Confidentiality and Role
The role was highly sensitive and kept private to avoid noise and information leaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:20">[02:24:20]</a>. Himanish operated as a "shadow analyst" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:28">[02:28:28]</a>, primarily communicating his findings and criticisms to the coaches, who then decided how to convey the information to the players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:30">[03:00:30]</a>. This intermediary approach was chosen to prevent "muddling the players with numbers or with research" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:51">[03:04:51]</a>. He only directly interacted with a few players, notably Rohit Sharma (the captain) and R. Ashwin, who was a fellow "nerd" and had read his prior articles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:59">[03:27:59]</a>.

### Application of Data
Himanish's primary focus was to leverage [[advanced_data_analysis_in_cricket_including_ball_revolutions | tracking data]] to better understand bowlers and batters in T20 cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:02">[02:31:02]</a>. The team management aimed to be the "most knowledgeable Team Management out there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:21">[00:50:21]</a>, committed to using all available data, from knowing ball speeds and angles to identifying which players excel at certain shots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:24">[00:50:24]</a>.

One example of a plan formulated through data was for the wicket of Heinrich Klaasen in a T20 World Cup final. A "wide slower ball" was discussed as a possibility due to Klaasen's limited foot movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:45">[00:43:45]</a>. When the plan was executed and led to a wicket, it provided immense satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:55">[00:43:55]</a>.

### Challenges and Rewards
Being an analyst for a high-profile team like India, watched by millions, is a "highly scary place to be in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:59">[02:41:59]</a>. Himanish experienced the powerlessness of the role, where despite extensive work and correct predictions, external factors or player decisions could lead to undesired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:53">[03:00:53]</a>. He learned to detach emotionally, sending his research a day or two before each game and then disengaging until after the match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:04">[03:34:04]</a>.

Despite the challenges, the satisfaction of seeing a team follow a plan derived from his analysis and achieve success is unparalleled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:19">[03:29:19]</a>. For Himanish, a hobbyist and not a formal cricketer, the validation of having his analysis deemed useful by figures like Rohit Sharma and Rahul Dravid was deeply rewarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:30">[03:41:30]</a>.

### Cultural Shift within the Team
Himanish believes the most significant contribution of his tenure was helping to "change the culture" within the Indian team towards embracing data for decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:22">[00:49:22]</a>. With Rohit and Rahul Dravid, there was a "right balance of data versus vibes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:34">[00:49:34]</a>, acknowledging that data complements, rather than replaces, cricketing intuition. Rahul Dravid, in particular, was described as "perhaps the most radical cricketer I've met in terms of thinking about T20" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:51">[00:47:51]</a>, understanding the format at a rare level despite public perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. This commitment to being highly knowledgeable and leveraging all possible data was a project that spanned two and a half years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:36">[00:44:36]</a>, ultimately culminating in a World Cup victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:48">[00:44:48]</a>.

The landscape of Indian fast bowling has seen a notable evolution, with discussions often centered around the emergence of new talent and their place among established names. A recent focal point has been Mayank Yadav, a young fast bowler whose brief but impactful appearances have sparked significant debate regarding his potential and comparisons to other bowlers, both Indian and international <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Mayank Yadav's Emergence and Early Career

Mayank Yadav gained significant attention after bowling just 73 deliveries in his early career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. His ability to consistently bowl at speeds exceeding 155 km/h, reaching up to 156 km/h, particularly in India where such pace is rare, generated immediate excitement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

He began his training around the age of 13 or 14 at the Sonnet Club in Delhi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, a renowned academy that has produced numerous Indian international players such as Ashish Nehra, Shikhar Dhawan, Rishabh Pant, and Manoj Prabhakar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Despite this pedigree, there was not much public attention on Yadav during his development, unlike some international prospects like [[comparisons_of_jasprit_bumrah_with_other_fast_bowlers | Pat Cummins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

### Comparison with Umran Malik

Mayank Yadav's arrival drew immediate [[comparisons_of_jasprit_bumrah_with_other_fast_bowlers | comparisons]] to Umran Malik, another Indian fast bowler who generated excitement with his raw speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. However, a key distinction noted was Yadav's perceived accuracy and repeatability, suggesting he had a better understanding of his bowling compared to Malik, who was often considered more erratic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

### Reasons for Delayed Recognition

Several factors contributed to Mayank Yadav not being widely known until recently:
*   **Injuries:** He has faced frequent injuries throughout his young career, which has limited his playing time for his domestic team, Delhi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   **Lack of Wicket-Taking Prolificacy:** While he possessed pace, his name wasn't heard much unless he was picking wickets consistently in junior cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   **Missing U19 World Cup Bus:** In India, the U19 World Cup has become a major platform for young prospects, and missing out on selection, as Yadav did in 2018, meant less public exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

He was picked by Lucknow in the IPL for his base price, indicating he wasn't considered a major prospect at that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. His debut was further delayed by a hamstring injury during a practice session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

## Mayank Yadav's Impactful IPL Performances

Despite the slow start, Mayank Yadav's performances in the IPL were immediately impactful.

### Match vs. Punjab Kings
In his debut against Punjab Kings, he was brought in late in the innings, in the 10th over, with Shikhar Dhawan and Jonny Bairstow having built a strong opening partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. While his first over went for 10 runs, the batters appeared rushed even then <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. He finished with figures of 3 for 27, completely changing the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

Notably, all his wickets were from shorter balls, where [[comparison_of_ipl_batters | batters]] attempting pull shots were overwhelmed by his pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Even experienced international players like Bairstow were noticeably rushed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

### Match vs. Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB)
His next game against RCB was even more impressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. He registered a speed of 156.4 km/h and took 3 for 14, including the wickets of Rajat Patidar, Glenn Maxwell, and Cameron Green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. These were not "replacement level players," but proper international cricketers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

Observations from his bowling against RCB:
*   **Faf du Plessis:** Was run out off Yadav's first or second ball, showing unusual footwork where he backed away from a full and straight delivery, reminiscent of older players avoiding quick bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   **Glenn Maxwell:** Known for his fast hands, appeared slow attempting a pull shot off a short ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Anuj Rawat:** As a left-hander, was visibly walking across his stumps and shortening his backlift to cope with the pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
*   **Interception Points:** [[comparison_of_ipl_batters | Batters]] were hitting Yadav's deliveries much further back on the stumps compared to other bowlers, indicating how quickly the ball was arriving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
*   **Cameron Green:** A batter who grew up playing on fast Perth wickets, appeared completely disoriented with his footwork, ultimately being bowled by a fuller length ball when anticipating a short delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. This dismissal was particularly striking, as it resembled an Indian batter struggling against pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

### The "Skiddy" Action and Pace Retention

The impact of Mayank Yadav's bowling led to discussions about his unique action and how it might differ from other fast bowlers. Unlike bowlers like Mark Wood or Anrich Nortje, who often "bang" the ball into the pitch and might lose some pace after the bounce, Yadav's deliveries appeared to "skid" off the surface, retaining their pace more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. This characteristic was compared to bowlers like Shamar Joseph, who, despite not having the highest raw speeds, "rushes" batters, and historically to Malcolm Marshall and Dale Steyn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. The theory is that his action might make it harder for batters to pick him up early, leading to them being hurried or backing away more often <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

## Challenges and Future Outlook

Despite his dazzling start, Mayank Yadav's career has been hampered by a recurring issue: injuries. In the span of just 73 balls across two IPL seasons, he suffered a lower side strain, an abdominal strain, and a hamstring strain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. This physical fragility is his "biggest issue" currently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. His limited experience in first-class (one game, 104 balls) and List A cricket (822 balls) also highlights his physical immaturity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.

### Management and Development
The BCCI recognizes Yadav as a "precious commodity" and is working to ensure his physical readiness, emphasizing the importance of not rushing him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. This approach mirrors the development of [[comparisons_of_jasprit_bumrah_with_other_fast_bowlers | Pat Cummins]], who debuted at 18 but didn't play regularly until 24, allowing his body to strengthen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>. There is a sense that a year or two of careful management is worth it to ensure his long-term fitness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>.

The BCCI has also implemented fast bowling contracts to build a pool of fast bowlers, especially as current stalwarts like [[comparisons_of_jasprit_bumrah_with_other_fast_bowlers | Jasprit Bumrah]] and Mohammed Shami eventually move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. Coaches like Bharat Arun and Paras Mhambrey, who have worked at the National Cricket Academy (NCA), are bringing more know-how to managing fast bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>.

### Future Potential
While it's too early to assess his red-ball cricket potential, particularly his accuracy and endurance for longer formats, he is seen as a "real asset" for India in limited-overs cricket if he can stay fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>. However, a more accurate assessment will require him to play consistently over a second or third season, similar to what was needed for Umran Malik <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>.

A challenge for Indian fast bowlers is the allure of the IPL, which sometimes leads them to prioritize it over domestic first-class cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>. For Mayank Yadav to play in major international tournaments like the Champions Trophy or T20 World Cup, he will need to demonstrate his readiness by playing for India outside of the IPL, as these tournaments often precede the league <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>.

## Historical Context of Indian Fast Bowling

The excitement surrounding Mayank Yadav reflects a long-standing desire among Indian fans for a "genuinely tearaway bowler" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:35">[00:24:35]</a>. Historically, Indian cricket has seen fast bowlers like Mohammed Nissar, who were genuinely quick but didn't play for extended periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>. There's a pattern of initial hype around fast bowlers who emerge, only for them to "drift away" over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>.

However, the current era is different. India is not "starved of fast bowling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>, with a strong pool of talent including [[comparisons_of_jasprit_bumrah_with_other_fast_bowlers | Jasprit Bumrah]], Mohammed Siraj, and Mohammed Shami <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>. This current success has led to more optimism that the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) can effectively manage and nurture young fast bowlers like Mayank Yadav, drawing on better "knowhow" than in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>.

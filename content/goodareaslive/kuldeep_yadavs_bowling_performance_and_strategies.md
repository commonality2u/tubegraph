[[kuldeep_yadavs_bowling_performance | Kuldeep Yadav]] has shown a significant shift in his bowling performance and role, particularly in the middle overs of One Day Internationals (ODIs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.

## Evolution of Performance
Previously, [[kuldeep_yadavs_bowling_performance | Kuldeep Yadav]] was regarded as one of the best strike bowlers in the middle overs, averaging 27 runs per wicket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>. However, over a recent, shorter sample size of ODIs, his average in the middle overs has risen significantly to 72 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. This change suggests he has transitioned from a world-class strike bowler to one whose average resembles that of a part-time finger spinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.

The perception is that he no longer looks like the same level of strike bowler he once was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>.

## Statistical Comparison
When compared to other [[indias_bowling_strategies_and_performance | India's frontline bowlers]] over the last couple of years in ODI cricket, a clear pattern emerges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>:
*   [[indias_bowling_strategies_and_performance | Jasprit Bumrah]] functions as a great defensive bowler who is still an above-average strike bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.
*   Mohammed Shami is generally the designated strike bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>.
*   Traditionally, [[kuldeep_yadavs_bowling_performance | Kuldeep Yadav]] would be categorized as a strike bowler, but his recent numbers show he has "sunk back" and is not far from [[ravi_jadejas_batting_performance_and_strategy | Ravindra Jadeja]], who is more of a defensive bowler good at taking wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>. He is still a long way from Axar Patel in terms of his bowling style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.

### Middle Overs Breakdown
Looking specifically at the middle overs, there's a stark contrast between the two periods of his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>:
*   **Early Career:** [[kuldeep_yadavs_bowling_performance | Kuldeep]] was an elite strike bowler in the middle overs, taking 0.6 wickets per 10 overs more than expected while being very economical (almost half a run less than desired) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.
*   **Recent Period:** He has become a "completely different creature" â€“ a defensive specialist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. His economy is now two runs an over better than expected, which is "ridiculous" and even rivals [[indias_bowling_strategies_and_performance | Jasprit Bumrah]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. However, he has "stopped taking wickets in the middle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.

## Reasons for the Change
The shift raises questions about whether [[kuldeep_yadavs_bowling_performance | Kuldeep Yadav's]] bowling has changed or if opponents are approaching him differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.
*   A small part of it might be that he's not as good at creating chances as he used to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.
*   However, a more significant factor could be that teams have decided not to attack him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. This phenomenon has been observed with other bowlers like Rashid Khan, Sunil Narine, and Bhuvneshwar Kumar in T20s, where teams adopt a strategy of "we can't attack this person, if we attack them we will go out, so we are just going to pull back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.
*   Paradoxically, when opponents *have* tried to attack him, they are *less* likely to stay in against him than before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>. This suggests that his defensive approach is working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>.
*   There's also a suggestion that his recent performance might be linked to an injury, leading him to bowl slower and with less "zip" off the wicket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>. This could be a choice or a result of injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:21">[00:50:21]</a>.

## Strategic Implications for [[indias_bowling_strategies_and_performance | India]]
The change in [[kuldeep_yadavs_bowling_performance | Kuldeep's]] role presents a strategic question for [[indias_bowling_strategies_and_performance | India's bowling strategies]]:
> [!QUESTION] Defensive or Attacking Bowler?
> Do [[indias_bowling_strategies_and_performance | India]] want a strike bowler, given they already have two other defensively minded bowlers ([[indias_bowling_strategies_and_performance | Jasprit Bumrah]] and [[ravi_jadejas_batting_performance and_strategy | Ravindra Jadeja]])? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a> They might be content with three defensive bowlers, believing that opponents will be forced to attack the finger spinners ([[ravi_jadejas_batting_performance_and_strategy | Jadeja]] and Axar Patel) more, bringing them into the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. Alternatively, they could opt for a more attacking bowler if they feel two great defensive bowlers are sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.

For now, it appears the team is comfortable with [[kuldeep_yadavs_bowling_performance | Kuldeep's]] current role because his defensive effectiveness forces different approaches from batsmen, which is "working" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>.

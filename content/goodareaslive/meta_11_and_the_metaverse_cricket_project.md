Meta 11 is a project initiated among friends to integrate [[crickets_global_expansion_and_governance|cricket]] into the metaverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. The project aims to democratize access to the sport, allowing anyone who loves cricket to play against others, as communities, or with friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Founding and Vision
Meta 11 was founded by Kumar Sangakkara, a retired international cricketer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The vision is to enable users to earn rewards and create or own their own cricketers within the metaverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. The project has been under development for a couple of years and is progressing well, having already raised significant funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## Gameplay and Features
The Meta 11 experience combines elements of fantasy cricket and a video game, similar to Football Manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Key features include:
*   **Customizable Avatars:** Players can own and customize their avatars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   **Digital Stadia:** Games are played in bespoke, digitally created stadiums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   **AI-Driven Gameplay:** The avatars are AI-driven, meaning they play and learn as they progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Players do not directly control the avatars during gameplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   **All-Rounder Avatars:** Each avatar functions as an all-rounder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Short Game Duration:** Games are designed to be very short, lasting between two and four minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Match Formats:** Users can play one-on-one or as smaller teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **Avatar Creation from Data:** Avatars can be created by dropping in personal stats or from [[analyzing_cricket_data|data]] that has been collected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

Kumar Sangakkara himself participated as one of the avatars, equipped with sensors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. He noted that his T20 record might make him less effective in the game's short format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. The game aims to help users understand the frustrations experienced by coaches, players, and spectators by immersing them in the gameplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

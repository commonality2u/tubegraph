England's cricket team has faced significant challenges and strategic dilemmas regarding its batting order, particularly within the [[englands_cricket_strategy_under_basball | "Bazball" era]]. While demonstrating resilience, the team's individual player performances and overall tactical approach have drawn scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:39">[01:34:39]</a>.

## Overall Batting Performance and Philosophy

Under "Bazball," England has been described as a "cockroach of modern test matches" or a "scorpion," indicating a persistent ability to remain competitive despite being outmatched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:09">[01:41:09]</a>. This philosophy is partly a reaction to not producing top-tier red-ball batters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:36:36">[55:36:36]</a>. The aim is to upset opponents and maximize existing talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:49:52">[55:49:52]</a>.

Previously, England's batting was "terrible," with extras being the fourth-leading scorer in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:03">[01:15:03]</a>. "Bazball" has revolutionized their play, leading to more competitive matches, even if they sometimes lose from "winning positions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:01">[01:10:01]</a>.

## Opening Partnership

Concerns have been raised regarding England's openers getting starts but failing to convert them into larger scores, especially in sub-continental conditions where the new ball is crucial for batting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:06:04">[41:06:04]</a>. The strategy is to capitalize on the new ball to put pressure back on India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:15:28">[41:15:28]</a>, but this approach introduces a "recklessness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:22:04">[41:22:04]</a>.

*   **Zack Crawley:** Despite a low average, he accumulates many runs due to numerous opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:48">[03:10:48]</a>. He uses his height effectively to alter the length bowlers target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:08">[07:01:08]</a>. While his average improved post-comeback, remaining in the low 30s, the team is "nitpicking" if expecting more given his previous performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:56:56">[41:56:56]</a>.
*   **Ben Duckett:** Initially failed as a young player but performed well after being brought back later in his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:50:41">[56:50:41]</a>. He bats deep in his crease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:55">[07:10:55]</a> and has been instructed to score runs quickly before dismissal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:24:26">[41:24:26]</a>. His average in the last five years is over 40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:04:39">[58:04:39]</a>.
*   **Dom Sibley:** Not performing well and no longer part of the lineup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:08">[03:02:08]</a>.

A suggestion for openers is to aim for 30-50 runs to set up the game, then "milk" runs afterward, allowing for re-evaluation of methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:30:26">[41:30:26]</a>.

## Middle Order Performance

The middle order is identified as a significant weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:24:55">[42:24:55]</a>. Many middle-order batters average below 40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:57:43">[57:57:43]</a>.

*   **Ollie Pope:** A younger player who has struggled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:38:58">[56:38:58]</a>. He averaged 23 before the series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:43">[15:05:43]</a> and 56 in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:07:09">[15:07:09]</a>. He played one good innings against spin but was "worked out" by India afterward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:07">[01:19:07]</a>.
*   **Jonny Bairstow:** An older player with a 35 average, who experienced a "Renaissance" during the "Bazball" period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:40:02">[56:40:02]</a>.
*   **Ben Stokes:** His batting average is 37-38 in Test cricket, not considered "particularly good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:14:09">[55:14:09]</a>.
*   **Joe Root:** Considered England's best batter, but has not scored enough runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>.
*   **Harry Brook:** Has a strong average of 62 in Test cricket and would likely have played in the series had he been available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:55:58">[56:55:58]</a>.
*   **Others:** Players like Rory Burns, Jos Buttler, Joe Denly, Dan Lawrence, Alex Lees, Dawid Malan, Haseeb Hameed, and Jason Roy have all been tried in recent years with limited success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:46:25">[56:46:25]</a>.

## Challenges with Team Selection

England has consistently tried various batters—young, old, tall, short, experienced, and debutants—but many have "failed" to establish consistent performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:50:56">[57:50:56]</a>. This indicates a broader issue in producing red-ball talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:36:36">[55:36:36]</a>, which `Bazball` is designed to mitigate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:42:03">[55:42:03]</a>.

This strategy, described as [[englands_batting_strategy_and_basball_philosophy | Bazball philosophy]], has allowed them to be competitive, but it doesn't mask the underlying talent gap compared to top teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:12">[01:11:12]</a>. England's approach allows them to "manufacture wickets" and play on the "egos of the opposition," which can lead to mini-collapses for the opposing team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:46:22">[38:46:22]</a>. However, this aggressive approach also means they are "playing a highly volatile style of cricket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:48">[01:18:48]</a>.

## Recent Performance in Champions Trophy

[[analysis_of_indias_cricket_teams_performance_and_dominance | India]] recently "hammered" [[pakistan_vs_india_champions_trophy_match_analysis | Pakistan]] by six wickets with 45 balls to spare in Dubai, virtually knocking the home team out of the Champions Trophy just five days into the tournament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:35">[01:19:35]</a>. This early exit for [[pakistan_vs_india_champions_trophy_match_analysis | Pakistan]] was described as a "dampner" given the tournament's early stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:60">[01:30:60]</a>.

## Pakistan's Cricket Team: Issues and Performance

[[analysis_of_past_cricket_teams_west_indies_pakistan_australia_and_england | Pakistan's]] performance in the Champions Trophy was criticized for its lack of favorable play, particularly their batting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:20">[02:15:20]</a>.

### Batting Concerns
[[analysis_of_past_cricket_teams_west_indies_pakistan_australia_and_england | Pakistan's]] batters were likened to "muscle relaxing sleeping pills" due to their slow scoring rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:78">[02:18:78]</a>.
Specific instances highlighted:
*   Between overs 10 and 25, they scored only 44 runs for no wicket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:78">[02:37:78]</a>.
*   From overs 10 to 20, they managed just 27 runs for no loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:88">[02:41:88]</a>.
*   In a previous game, they were 22 for 2 in the first 10 overs and 66 for 2 after 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:18">[02:45:18]</a>.
*   They scored less than three runs per over for 15 overs after a decent power play start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:48">[03:14:48]</a>.
*   From overs 11 to 25, only one boundary was scored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:78">[04:26:78]</a>.

The team's batting often involves players going into a shell when they need to rotate strike, and then getting out immediately when they try to attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:78">[06:53:78]</a>. Many Pakistani batters average 45-50 in ODI Cricket but at a strike rate of only 80-86 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:78">[07:16:78]</a>. This contrasts with players like Rassie van der Dussen, who, despite a similar average and strike rate, can hit sixes when needed at the end of an innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:78">[07:51:78]</a>.

Imam's innings, while "great," put no pressure on [[analysis_of_indias_cricket_teams_performance_and_dominance | India]], leading to a score of 240-odd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:88">[08:00:88]</a>. Mohammad Rizwan's innings was criticized for having "only two gears" (third gear and slugging) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:98">[08:20:98]</a>. He was 16 for 41 at one point and his strike rate against pace bowling in the entire innings was 42 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:68">[14:41:68]</a>, showing a struggle to catch up if he falls behind the rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:78">[15:10:78]</a>.

Babar Azam's current form was described as a "five boundary player" with an "attractive score in the 20s or a 90 ball 64" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:38">[13:42:38]</a>. He either plays too many dot balls or gets out trying to attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:88">[13:54:88]</a>. Saud Shakeel was considered [[analysis_of_past_cricket_teams_west_indies_pakistan_australia_and_england | Pakistan's]] best batter in the recent match, displaying various sweep shots and pulling for four, but eventually getting out trying an aerial pull after being dropped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:08:58">[14:08:58]</a>.

### Bowling and Fielding Deficiencies
[[analysis_of_past_cricket_teams_west_indies_pakistan_australia_and_england | Pakistan]] were 39 runs short of a competitive total of 280-odd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:78">[05:31:78]</a>, getting bowled out for 241 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:98">[05:33:98]</a>. They also dropped two catches, including a short mid-wicket chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:78">[05:37:78]</a>. The collapse had "shades of Amad 2023," with wickets falling like a "house of cards" after two batters were set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:28">[05:45:28]</a>.

Shaheen Afridi's bowling figures of 2 for 74 in eight overs were criticized, with Sunil Gavaskar noting that Indian batters were treating him like a spinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:27:78">[17:27:78]</a>. Shubman Gill "pulverized" him, and Virat Kohli charged him down the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:36:18">[17:36:18]</a>. His current form is a significant concern, needing a "proper review" and potential six-month break to fix issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:56:08">[19:56:08]</a>. Haris Rauf was described as having not recovered from "the yips" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:08:88">[21:08:88]</a>.

### Structural and Selection Issues
[[analysis_of_past_cricket_teams_west_indies_pakistan_australia_and_england | Pakistan]] faces "same old issues," including a lack of all-rounders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:68">[05:58:68]</a>, often playing without a fifth bowler or, if Mohammad Nawaz plays, without a seventh batter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:58">[08:43:53]</a>. Khushdil Shah, categorized as an all-rounder, averages 83 with the ball in ODI Cricket and has only four wickets in total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:78">[08:53:78]</a>. His record in List A cricket also shows he's not a frontline spinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:18">[09:49:18]</a>.

The selection panel, comprising Azhar Ali, Asad Shafiq, Aleem Dar, Aaqib Javed, and Hasan Cheema, picks the starting XI for every team, leaving the captain without power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:18">[11:22:18]</a>. This system is seen as "not feasible" and "horrendous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:68">[11:36:68]</a>. The team lacks depth compared to other top sides, making them vulnerable to injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:29:48">[22:29:48]</a>.

## India's Cricket Team: Strengths and Performance

[[analysis_of_indias_cricket_teams_performance_and_dominance | India's]] team showcases significant strengths, particularly in batting depth and all-round capabilities.

### Batting Prowess
Virat Kohli scored an unbeaten 100, his 51st ODI century, making him two clear of Sachin Tendulkar and the fastest to 14,000 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:39:78">[32:39:78]</a>. He is also third in most runs in international cricket, behind only Sachin and Kumar Sangakkara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:49:18">[32:49:18]</a>. Kohli "loves playing [[analysis_of_past_cricket_teams_west_indies_pakistan_australia_and_england | Pakistan]]", with 6 fifty-plus scores (four of which are hundreds) in 17 ODI innings against them, a conversion rate of 66.7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:54:18">[32:54:18]</a>. His batting average against [[analysis_of_past_cricket_teams_west_indies_pakistan_australia_and_england | Pakistan]] in multinational tournaments is 81.4, the highest for a minimum of 1000 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:10:78">[33:10:78]</a>.

Shreyas Iyer, despite not being in original plans, has cemented his place at number four, scoring consistently and improving his game against the short ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:31:88">[41:31:88]</a>. He has a very high average (80ish) against spin in modern cricket history for a minimum of 1000 balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:27:68">[42:27:68]</a>.

### All-Rounders
Hardik Pandya delivered a crucial spell of 2 for 31 in 8 overs, described as "the most important spell of the day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:01:88">[49:01:88]</a>. He is considered a "luxury in modern day cricket" due to his balance and all-phase bowling capabilities (new ball, middle overs, death) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:42:38">[48:42:38]</a>.

## Historical and Comparative Context

The current [[india_vs_pakistan_match_analysis | India vs Pakistan]] dynamic shows a significant skill gap. While [[evolution_of_india_and_pakistans_cricket_teams_over_the_years | Pakistan]] had a "mental advantage" in the late 80s and early 90s, when they were arguably a better side with strong bowling and all-rounders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:43:28">[23:43:28]</a>, that has now shifted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:48:88">[23:48:88]</a>.

Many Indian players not even in the current squad would easily make [[analysis_of_past_cricket_teams_west_indies_pakistan_australia_and_england | Pakistan's]] team, including Yashasvi Jaiswal, Ravi Bishnoi, Ruturaj Gaikwad, Mohammed Siraj (despite current form), Abhishek Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav, and even fringe players like Rahul Tripathi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:19:98">[24:19:98]</a>. This highlights the depth of Indian cricket.

> "At the moment [[analysis_of_indias_cricket_teams_performance_and_dominance | India]] is just a massive step up for [[analysis_of_past_cricket_teams_west_indies_pakistan_australia_and_england | Pakistan]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:57:48">[25:57:48]</a>.

### Impact of IPL on Pakistan Players
A hypothetical question was posed: would [[analysis_of_past_cricket_teams_west_indies_pakistan_australia_and_england | Pakistan's]] players win more against [[analysis_of_indias_cricket_teams_performance_and_dominance | India]] if they played in the IPL regularly? The consensus was that it might not make a significant difference currently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:04:18">[59:04:18]</a>. This is because their current crop of players, despite financial incentives from other leagues, are not maximizing their white-ball potential by playing slowly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:10:28">[59:10:28]</a>.

### All-Rounder Comparison: Hardik Pandya vs. Kapil Dev vs. Ravindra Jadeja
*   **Hardik Pandya**: A modern-day luxury due to his unique mold and immense balance to the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:36:28">[48:36:28]</a>. He is a "smart bowler" who adapts to the assignment (pace off, back of a length) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:00:28">[50:00:28]</a>. The main issue is his limited number of games played (less than 100 ODIs) and wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:16:78">[49:16:78]</a>.
*   **Ravindra Jadeja**: Has played over 200 games with a similar bowling average to Pandya, but a slower strike rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:27:68">[49:27:68]</a>. He blossomed later in his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:07:98">[50:07:98]</a>.
*   **Kapil Dev**: Considered superior to both Pandya and Jadeja <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:02:48">[51:02:48]</a>. If he played in the current era, his adjusted record would show him averaging 30 with the bat at a 113 strike rate, almost identical to Pandya's batting numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:35:88">[50:35:88]</a>. Crucially, he was the "best bowler in the side," taking 250 wickets at 27 with an economical rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:47:38">[50:47:38]</a>. Unlike Pandya, Kapil Dev was a frontline bowler who bowled at the top and death, constantly required to bowl out and bat up every game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:28:18">[51:28:18]</a>.
*   **Yuvraj Singh**: Took 110 wickets in 300 games, functioning as a "sixth bowler" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:06:98">[53:06:98]</a>.

## Conclusion

The recent [[india_versus_pakistan_odi_world_cup_2023_analysis | India vs Pakistan Champions Trophy match analysis]] highlights a significant disparity between the two teams. [[analysis_of_indias_cricket_teams_performance_and_dominance | India]] demonstrates depth, adaptability, and strong individual performances, particularly from players like Virat Kohli and Hardik Pandya. Conversely, [[analysis_of_past_cricket_teams_west_indies_pakistan_australia_and_england | Pakistan]] is plagued by batting struggles, inconsistent bowling, and structural issues stemming from their selection process and lack of specialized all-rounders. The current [[evolution_of_india_and_pakistans_cricket_teams_over_the_years | skill gap]] means [[analysis_of_past_cricket_teams_west_indies_pakistan_australia_and_england | Pakistan]] is "a good light year behind in limited overs cricket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:06:68">[30:06:68]</a>.

Match-fixing, spot-fixing, and related corruption have marred the sport of cricket through its history, leading to significant scandals and bans for prominent players.

## Notable Match-Fixing Cases

### Salman Butt
Former Pakistan Test captain [[crickets_biggest_cheats_and_scandals | Salman Butt]] was involved in a spot-fixing scandal in 2010. After leading Pakistan to victories against Australia at Headingley and England at The Oval, he instructed his fast bowlers to bowl pre-arranged no-balls during a Test match at Lord's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Despite previous [[impact_of_fixing_scandals_in_cricket | spot-fixing scandals]] in the 1990s and early 2000s, Butt engaged in this act as Test captain, considered the highest honor in cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. He served jail time for his involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. The International Cricket Council (ICC) had prior knowledge of his suspicious activities, noting an "extraordinary number of phones" he possessed before the scandal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Butt has been criticized for never truly apologizing for his actions, even claiming in his trial that "Cricket is not that serious, it's just like wrestling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

### Hansie Cronje
Hansie Cronje, former captain of South Africa, was found to have engaged in match-fixing activities. He was implicated for selling out his country, reportedly for inducements such as a leather jacket for his wife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Cronje was also criticized for corrupting younger players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a> and forcing results in Test matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. His actions were particularly impactful given the goodwill surrounding South Africa's re-entry into international cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. A Netflix documentary, "Bad Sport," covers his fixing incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>, highlighting an "unfortunate love of money" that was apparent in his behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

### Marlon Samuels
West Indies player Marlon Samuels has been banned twice for corruption. In 2008, he received a two-year ban for leaking information to an Indian bookie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. After returning and winning two T20 World Cups, he was recently banned again for six years due to corruption in the T10 league in Abu Dhabi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. His repeated involvement in fixing, despite a prior ban, has been noted as a significant tarnishing of his legacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.

### Mohammad Asif
Considered one of the most talented bowlers in history, Pakistan's Mohammad Asif was involved in the 2010 [[impact_of_fixing_scandals_in_cricket | spot-fixing scandal]] alongside Salman Butt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:35">[00:29:35]</a>. Beyond fixing, Asif faced bans for nandrolone, a performance-enhancing drug, and was caught with opioids at Dubai airport, leading to a ban from playing in the UAE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a>. He was reportedly high while playing club cricket in Islamabad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>. His career is seen as a tragedy due to his immense skill that could have made him one of Pakistan's best fast bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.

### Lou Vincent
New Zealand player Lou Vincent was involved in significant fixing within the county circuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>. He was previously suspected of being caught with a bookie, but this was initially "brushed under the rug" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>. Vincent eventually came clean about his involvement, an act of bravery that earned him some sympathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>. His case was a highlight of a broader fixing scandal that included a legal case involving Chris Cairns, though Cairns' involvement was not proven in court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:43">[00:31:43]</a>.

### Mohammad Azharuddin
Mohammad Azharuddin, a former Indian captain from the 1990s era, was implicated in fixing allegations. Despite being a "good player" and a "good Captain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a>, he received a lifetime ban, which was later overturned, but too late to salvage his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a>. He is generally believed to have been "fixing adjacent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a>, with Hansie Cronje reportedly claiming Azharuddin introduced him to bookies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:15">[00:34:15]</a>.

### Shane Warne
Shane Warne, one of cricket's greatest players, was involved in two major scandals. He was implicated in match-fixing for providing information to bookies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>. Additionally, he received a one-year suspension in the middle of his career for using a masking agent (drugs), which he attributed to weight loss efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>. Despite these incidents, his reputation is often perceived as better than other athletes who committed similar offenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>.

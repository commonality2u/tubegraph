The classification of a "part-time bowler" in cricket is highly [[the_subjectivity_in_classifying_part_time_versus_allrounder_bowlers | subjective]] and can be difficult to define, especially when distinguishing them from fifth bowlers or all-rounders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. One suggested method for [[defining_part_time_bowlers_in_cricket_history | defining part-time bowlers]] in One Day International (ODI) cricket was if a player averaged more than five overs per game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. However, this definition would include players like Darren Lehmann and Viv Richards, who are not traditionally seen as all-rounders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.

Many players who started primarily as bowlers, like Sanath Jayasuriya, later developed their batting to a high level, making their initial classification as a bowler ambiguous when considering their overall career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:09:00">[17:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21:00">[17:21:00]</a>. Similarly, some players, like Steve Waugh and Hansie Cronje, might appear to have part-time bowling statistics due to injuries or the strength of their team's bowling attack, even if they were initially considered more significant bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.

### Key Characteristics of Part-Time Bowlers
*   **Variety**: Many part-time bowlers, especially spinners, could bowl multiple styles (e.g., off-spin, leg-spin, medium pace) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>.
*   **Situational Use**: They were often brought on to break partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>, provide variety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>, or in conditions favourable to their style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:37:00">[18:37:00]</a>.
*   **Impact over Volume**: Some part-timers had remarkable records despite not bowling often <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:31:00">[18:31:00]</a>.
*   **Player's Desire**: A unique category includes players who actively disliked bowling but still performed well when forced to (e.g., Michael Bevan, Simon Katich) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:00">[10:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:22:00">[28:22:00]</a>.

### Notable Part-Time Bowlers

#### Sachin Tendulkar
*   **Role**: Considered a handy bowler who could pick up wickets, particularly in ODI cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>. He was a "partnership breaker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>.
*   **Statistics**:
    *   Tests: 46 wickets at an average of 54 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:00:00">[20:00:00]</a>. His Test record was surprisingly poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.
    *   ODIs: 154 wickets at an average of 44 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>, with an economy of 5.1, which was low for his era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>. His ODI record is considered good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>.
    *   T20Is: 1 wicket in 15 deliveries at an average of 12 and an economy of 4.8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>.
*   **Bowling Style**: Bowled off-spin and leg-spin at different times, and potentially medium pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>.
*   **Usage**: Not consistently used as a fifth bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>. His bowling often consisted of "moon balls and random crap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. He bowled less when players like Virender Sehwag and Suresh Raina emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.

#### Carl Hooper
*   **Role**: Considered a part-timer "in spirit" due to his high bowling average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>, despite bowling a significant amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>. He seemed uninterested in the craft of bowling, relying on natural athletic ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:00">[12:35:00]</a>.
*   **Statistics**:
    *   Tests: 114 wickets in 102 matches at an average of 49.42 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>. It's considered hard to average 49 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>.
    *   ODIs: 193 wickets in 227 matches at 36.05, with an economy of 4.36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>. His ODI record was that of a fifth bowler at times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>.
*   **Notable Feats**: Famously dismissed Allan Border seven times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:00]</a>.
*   **Context**: West Indies teams during his era often relied on batsmen like Hooper and Viv Richards to bowl due to a lack of specialist spinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:52:00">[16:52:00]</a>.

#### Michael Bevan
*   **Role**: A fascinating case of a player who "actively was fighting the urge to bowl" but was sometimes picked for his bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:00">[10:38:00]</a>. He is remembered as one of the best part-timers due to this juxtaposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>.
*   **Statistics**:
    *   Tests: 29 wickets in 18 matches at 24, including a 10-wicket haul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:00">[10:08:00]</a>.
    *   ODIs: 36 wickets in 232 matches at 46 with an economy of five runs an over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>. His ODI bowling was not particularly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>.
*   **Bowling Style**: Left-arm wrist spin (leg-spin), bowled unusually fast for a spinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>. His best balls were compared to Shane Warne's, but his worst were described as erratic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:00">[10:58:00]</a>.

#### Mohammad Hafeez
*   **Role**: Often considered an all-rounder, but his bowling usage outside a specific period suggests a part-time role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:00">[15:10:00]</a>. He was the third spinner behind Saeed Ajmal and Shahid Afridi during a phase where he bowled a lot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47:00">[14:47:00]</a>.
*   **Statistics**:
    *   Tests: 53 wickets in 55 matches at 35 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:25:00">[14:25:00]</a>.
    *   ODIs: 139 wickets in 218 matches at 28.84, with an economy of 4.18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a>.
    *   T20Is: 61 wickets in 119 matches at 22.75, with an economy of 6.6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:39:00">[14:39:00]</a>.
*   **Context**: He was particularly effective against left-handed batsmen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:48:00">[15:48:00]</a>.

#### Doug Walters
*   **Role**: A "blast from the past" with a remarkable part-time record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:14:00">[18:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:31:00">[18:31:00]</a>. Stories suggest he would take a wicket and then not want to continue bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:40:00">[18:40:00]</a>.
*   **Statistics**:
    *   Tests: 49 wickets in 74 matches at an average of 29 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:20:00">[18:20:00]</a>. His average of 29 is considered ridiculous for a part-timer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:37:00">[19:37:00]</a>.
    *   ODIs: Bowled in 10 innings across 28 matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:14:00">[20:14:00]</a>, and was not particularly good in the format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:20:00">[20:20:00]</a>.
    *   First-Class: 190 wickets in 258 games, with an overall bowling average of 35 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:47:00">[18:47:00]</a>.
*   **Bowling Style**: A bustling medium-pacer who could swing the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:07:00">[19:07:00]</a>.
*   **Legacy**: Famous more for his off-field antics (smoking, drinking) than his cricket, despite also averaging 48 with the bat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:02:00">[21:02:00]</a>.

#### Michael Clarke
*   **Role**: Considered a very handy bowler, remembered for significant performances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:41:00">[22:41:00]</a>. His back injury impacted his later bowling career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:33:00">[23:33:00]</a>.
*   **Statistics**:
    *   Tests: 31 wickets in 115 matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:45:00">[21:45:00]</a>, averaging 38.19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:16:00">[24:16:00]</a>.
    *   ODIs: 57 wickets in 245 matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:50:00">[21:50:00]</a>, averaging 37.64 with an economy under five <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:23:00">[24:23:00]</a>.
    *   T20Is: 6 wickets in 34 matches at 37.5, with an economy of 8.65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:53:00">[21:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:27:00">[24:27:00]</a>.
*   **Notable Feats**: Took 6 wickets against India in two memorable Test matches, including one at the SCG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:09:00">[22:09:00]</a>.
*   **Bowling Style**: Left-arm finger spinner with a good loop that often went straight, deceiving batsmen who played for spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:10:00">[23:10:00]</a>. In ODIs, his arm action could be very low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:39:00">[23:39:00]</a>.

#### Aravinda de Silva
*   **Role**: The "actual part-time Sri Lankan bowler" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:43:00">[25:43:00]</a>. While considered an all-rounder during the 1996 World Cup period, he didn't bowl much and was known for picking up wickets when given the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:48:00">[25:48:00]</a>.
*   **Statistics**:
    *   Tests: 29 wickets in 58 innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:07:00">[26:07:00]</a>.
    *   ODIs: 106 wickets in 156 innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:12:00">[26:12:00]</a>, averaging 41 and 39 respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:12:00">[26:12:00]</a>. Has a couple of four-wicket hauls in ODIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:16:00">[26:16:00]</a>.
*   **Context**: Often used as an additional bowler in the 90s, especially in spin-friendly conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:22:00">[26:22:00]</a>. His performance in the 1996 World Cup influenced perceptions of his bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:45:00">[26:45:00]</a>.

#### Simon Katich
*   **Role**: Voted by King Cricket as the best Test part-time bowler of all time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:47:00">[27:47:00]</a>. He "hated bowling" and had to be "dragged to the crease" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:25:00">[28:25:00]</a>.
*   **Statistics**:
    *   Tests: 21 wickets in 25 innings across 56 matches at an average of 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:54:00">[27:54:00]</a>, with a strike rate of a wicket every 49 balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:59:00">[27:59:00]</a>.
    *   ODIs & T20Is: Never bowled in ODIs or T20Is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:03:00">[28:03:00]</a>. Bowled only 18 balls in 118 T20 games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:12:00">[28:12:00]</a>.
    *   First-Class: 107 wickets in 266 games at 35 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:08:00">[29:08:00]</a>.
*   **Definition**: His disinterest in bowling despite his effectiveness makes him a "perfect part-timer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:19:00">[29:19:00]</a>.

#### Nathan Astle
*   **Role**: Considered an iconic "military medium part-timer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:36:00">[30:36:00]</a>.
*   **Statistics**:
    *   Tests: 51 wickets in 81 matches at 42 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:05:00">[30:05:00]</a>.
    *   ODIs: 99 wickets in 223 matches at 38.47, with an economy of 4.7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:09:00">[30:09:00]</a>.
    *   T20Is: 4 wickets in 4 matches at 12.5, with an economy of 7.31 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:15:00">[30:15:00]</a>.

#### Chris Gayle
*   **Role**: Follows the tradition of West Indian batsmen who bowled a lot due to a lack of specialist spinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:06:00">[34:06:00]</a>. He was not picked for his bowling, but could bowl "a little bit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:21:00">[34:21:00]</a>. His bowling decreased due to hamstring injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:36:00">[34:36:00]</a>.
*   **Statistics**:
    *   Tests: 73 wickets in 103 matches at 42.73 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:22:00">[33:22:00]</a>.
    *   ODIs: 167 wickets in 301 matches at 35.48, with an economy of 4.78 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:32:00">[33:32:00]</a>.
    *   T20Is: 20 wickets in 79 matches at 22, with an economy of less than seven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:44:00">[33:44:00]</a>.

#### Craig McMillan
*   **Role**: Exemplifies the "ridiculously arrogant part-timer" who believed he should be a new ball bowler despite his speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:22:00">[36:22:00]</a>. He was willing to be silly and bounce people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:08:00">[37:08:00]</a>.
*   **Statistics**:
    *   Tests: 28 wickets in 55 matches at just under 45 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:29:00">[37:29:00]</a>.
    *   ODIs: 49 wickets in 197 matches at 35, with an economy of 5.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:34:00">[37:34:00]</a>.
    *   Bowled in 74 ODI innings with an average of 35 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:32:00">[31:32:00]</a>.
*   **Legacy**: Considered a very underrated commentator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:53:00">[37:53:00]</a>.

#### Andrew Symonds
*   **Role**: A utility bowler who could bowl both seam and spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:12:00">[39:12:00]</a>. Although picked as an all-rounder, he was often used as a part-timer in international cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:00:00">[40:00:00]</a>. Similar to Carl Hooper and Chris Gayle, he didn't appear to care much about his bowling technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:23:00">[42:23:00]</a>.
*   **Statistics**:
    *   Tests: 24 wickets in 41 innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:34:00">[41:34:00]</a>.
    *   ODIs: 133 wickets in 158 innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:38:00">[41:38:00]</a>, averaging over 37 in both formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:43:00">[41:43:00]</a>.
    *   T20Is: 8 wickets in 14 matches, averaging 34.5 with an economy just under nine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:47:00">[42:47:00]</a>.
*   **Context**: Deckan Chargers used him to defend 18 runs in the last over of a game in the first IPL, which he conceded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:16:00">[41:16:00]</a>.

#### Charlotte Edwards
*   **Role**: Known for her "horrendous" and "disgusting" bowling style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:20:00">[44:20:00]</a>, despite a decent ODI record. Her bowling was often characterized by "moon balls and random crap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:56:00">[44:56:00]</a>.
*   **Statistics**:
    *   Tests: 12 wickets in 20 innings, averaging 48 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:30:00">[43:30:00]</a>.
    *   ODIs: 54 wickets in 51 innings, averaging 21 with an economy of 4.3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:36:00">[43:36:00]</a>.
*   **Context**: Often considered one of the worst part-timers to bowl regularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:01:00">[44:01:00]</a>.

#### Joe Root
*   **Role**: Often debated whether he is an all-rounder, but firmly classified as a very good sixth bowler or part-timer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:05:00">[46:05:00]</a>. He is a "really clever bowler" and "fantastically interesting" part-timer due to his varied deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:16:00">[47:16:00]</a>.
*   **Statistics**:
    *   Tests: 71 wickets in 152 matches at 45.36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:37:00">[46:37:00]</a>.
    *   ODIs: 28 wickets in 177 matches at 61.85, with an economy under six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:41:00">[46:41:00]</a>. His ODI average is surprisingly high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:12:00">[48:12:00]</a>.
    *   T20Is: 6 wickets at 23.16 with an economy of nearly 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:01:00">[48:01:00]</a>.
*   **Bowling Style**: Known for trying various deliveries like the carrom ball, leg-spin, and off-spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:44:00">[47:44:00]</a>.

#### Yuvraj Singh
*   **Role**: A strong candidate, especially due to his impact in limited-overs cricket, including winning a World Cup for India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:01:00">[49:01:00]</a>.
*   **Statistics**:
    *   Tests: 9 wickets in 40 matches at 60.77, considered "terrible reading" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:00:00">[49:00:00]</a>.
    *   ODIs: 111 wickets in 304 matches at 38.68, with an economy of 5.1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:04:00">[49:04:00]</a>. His bowling was important in the World Cup victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:11:00">[49:11:00]</a>.
    *   T20Is: 28 wickets at 17.82, with an economy of 7.06 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:15:00">[49:15:00]</a>.
*   **Context**: His limited-overs performances compensate for his red-ball record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:23:00">[49:23:00]</a>. He and Michael Bevan are noted as part-timers who potentially had the talent to be frontline bowlers if they had focused on it consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:01:00">[50:00:00]</a>.

### Other Players Discussed as Potential Part-Timers
*   **Darren Lehmann**: Considered a significant miss from a list of part-time bowlers, with an average under 30 in both Tests and ODIs, despite an aesthetically "disgusting" bowling style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:04:00">[53:04:00]</a>.
*   **Viv Richards**: Included in the definition of those who averaged more than five overs per game in ODIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.
*   **Allan Border**: Surprisingly unpicked despite a good ODI average of 28.36 and an economy of 4.66 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:16:00">[52:16:00]</a>.
*   **Tillakaratne Dilshan**: Often used with the new ball in ODI cricket, which complicates his part-timer classification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:51:00">[50:51:00]</a>. He eventually became a batsman but was initially considered an all-rounder or a versatile player who could bowl a bit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:13:00">[51:13:00]</a>.
*   **Sourav Ganguly**: Remembered for dismissing Sanath Jayasuriya on 189 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:30:00">[53:30:00]</a>. His Test average was over 50, but his ODI record was good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:49:00">[52:49:00]</a>.

*   **Glenn Phillips**: Currently an ongoing career, could become an all-rounder but is currently considered a part-timer who bowls like one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:51:00">[51:51:00]</a>.
*   **Doug Bollinger**: Had a better bowling average than Doug Walters in Tests (just under 26) with 50 wickets in 12 matches, but his body gave away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:38:00">[20:38:00]</a>.

*   **Hansie Cronje**: Would have been a fifth bowler for most teams, but in South Africa, he was a sixth bowler due to many all-rounders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.
*   **Angelo Mathews**: Compared to Steve Waugh as someone initially picked as an all-rounder whose body fell apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:58:00">[32:58:00]</a>.

*   **Jeremy Coney**: An original Kiwi seamer who "nibbled around" and despite his thoughts on his own bowling, was considered a bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:42:00">[57:42:00]</a>.

> [!INFO] Definition of a Part-Time Bowler
> The podcast highlights two types of part-timers: those like Sachin Tendulkar or Carl Hooper, who may not have been technically "good" at bowling but kept doing it, and those like Michael Bevan or Simon Katich, who actively disliked bowling but performed exceptionally well when forced to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:00">[10:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:21:00">[29:21:00]</a>.

> [!WARNING] The Subjectivity of Classification
> The discussion frequently returns to the [[the_subjectivity_in_classifying_part_time_versus_allrounder_bowlers | subjectivity]] of classifying part-time bowlers, noting that a player's perceived role can vary greatly based on their team's needs, their personal preferences, and individual performances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. Players like Mohammad Hafeez and Andrew Symonds, who had high professional wicket counts but were used situationally at the international level, illustrate this challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:48:00">[41:48:00]</a>.

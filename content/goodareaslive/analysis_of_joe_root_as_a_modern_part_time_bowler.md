The role and definition of [[defining_part_time_bowlers_in_cricket_history | part-time bowlers]] in cricket has always been a subject of debate, often leading to [[the_subjectivity_in_classifying_part_time_versus_allrounder_bowlers | subjective interpretations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. While some definitions exist, like averaging more than five overs per game in ODI cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, these can still include players who are not traditionally considered [[the_subjectivity_in_classifying_part_time_versus_allrounder_bowlers | all-rounders]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

[[role_and_effectiveness_of_joe_root_as_a_bowler_in_test_cricket | Joe Root]] is not very good at taking wickets." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:59">[00:46:59]</a>

## Bowling Record and Style

[[role_and_effectiveness_of_joe_root_as_a_bowler_in_test_cricket | Joe Root]]'s bowling statistics reflect his status as a part-time option rather than a frontline bowler:
*   **Tests:** 71 wickets in 152 tests at an average of 45.36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:37">[00:46:37]</a>.
*   **ODIs:** 28 wickets in 177 ODIs at an average of 61.85 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>, with an economy rate under six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>. This high ODI average was a primary reason for not selecting him earlier in a draft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:12">[00:48:12]</a>.
*   **T20is:** 6 wickets at an average of 23.16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:03">[00:48:03]</a>, with an economy of nearly 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:06">[00:48:06]</a>. Interestingly, his T20i average is his best across formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:09">[00:48:09]</a>.

Despite not being prolific in terms of wickets, [[role_and_effectiveness_of_joe_root_as_a_bowler_in_test_cricket | Joe Root]] is described as a "really clever bowler" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:16">[00:47:16]</a>. He is known for experimenting with different deliveries, having "tried the car ball," bowled [[role_and_impact_of_part_time_bowlers_in_cricket | leg spin]], and [[role_and_impact_of_part_time_bowlers_in_cricket | off spin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:44">[00:47:44]</a>. However, a limitation of his bowling is his inconsistency in landing the ball in the same spot repeatedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:30">[00:47:30]</a>. His approach is often compared to other part-timers who bowl with variety and unpredictability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:22">[00:47:22]</a>. He even opened the bowling in a World Cup final <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:06">[00:51:06]</a>.

> [[role_and_effectiveness_of_joe_root_as_a_bowler_in_test_cricket | Joe Root]]'s willingness to experiment with various types of deliveries makes him a "fantastically interesting" part-time bowler, even if his accuracy is inconsistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>.

## Comparisons to Other Part-Time Bowlers

[[role_and_effectiveness_of_joe_root_as_a_bowler_in_test_cricket | Joe Root]]'s bowling style and statistical profile are often compared to other notable part-timers:
*   **Sachin Tendulkar:** Like Tendulkar, [[role_and_effectiveness_of_joe_root_as_a_bowler_in_test_cricket | Root]] sometimes bowls unusual deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:02">[00:45:02]</a>. Tendulkar also had the ability to bowl multiple different skills within an over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **Charlotte Edwards & Craig McMillan:** [[role_and_effectiveness_of_joe_root_as_a_bowler_in_test_cricket | Root]] falls into a similar category of unpredictable and varied part-time bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:19">[00:47:19]</a>. McMillan, like Root, opened the bowling in a World Cup final <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:08">[00:51:08]</a>.
*   **Liam Livingstone:** Mentioned as a contemporary player with the ability to bowl multiple different skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Carl Hooper:** Hooper is often remembered as a bowler even though his test bowling average was nearly 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. Similarly, [[role_and_effectiveness_of_joe_root_as_a_bowler_in_test_cricket | Root]]'s relatively high average suggests he shouldn't be considered a frontline option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:50">[00:46:50]</a>.
*   **Yuvraj Singh:** Both [[role_and_effectiveness_of_joe_root_as_a_bowler_in_test_cricket | Root]] and Singh were considered essential to a part-time bowling list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:35">[00:50:35]</a>.
*   **Dilshan:** Like [[role_and_effectiveness_of_joe_root_as_a_bowler_in_test_cricket | Joe Root]], Dilshan was used with the new ball in ODI cricket, an important role for a part-timer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>.

In summary, while [[role_and_effectiveness_of_joe_root_as_a_bowler_in_test_cricket | Joe Root]] may not consistently take wickets, his versatility, strategic value as a sixth bowling option, and unpredictable nature make him a "fantastically interesting" modern part-time bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>.

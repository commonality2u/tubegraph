The governance and structure within the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) have historically faced challenges, marked by a frequent turnover of leadership and a perceived lack of professionalism. Recent initiatives, particularly the introduction of a new mentor program and domestic tournament structure, aim to bring greater clarity and consistency to the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Historical Context and Challenges

An ongoing theme observed within the PCB has been a lack of [[professionalism_and_player_development_in_pakistan | professionalism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This manifests in the high frequency of changes among chairmen, selectors, and coaches, which has detrimental effects on [[pakistans_cricket_strategy_and_performance_issues | Pakistan's cricket strategy and performance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. A lack of clarity at the top level is believed to hinder consistent results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

Concerns about [[management_and_structural_issues_within_pakistan_cricket | management and structural issues]] have also arisen from the PCB's historical reliance on "foreign coaches or former stars" as solutions to problems, rather than establishing robust, long-term structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. Communication between the PCB and the public has also been identified as an area needing improvement, as fans often misunderstand new initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

## New Initiatives and Reforms

### The Champions Tournament
The PCB has introduced a "Champions Tournament" into the system, which is seen as a positive development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This tournament is part of a broader effort by stakeholders to implement something new to address the inconsistencies in Pakistan's cricketing performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. The aim is to bring more [[professionalism_and_player_development_in_pakistan | professionalism]] into domestic cricket and reduce the performance gap between national and domestic players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

### The Mentor Program
Central to the new structure is the appointment of five mentors, who have been granted significant authority over 30-35 selected players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This [[role_and_responsibilities_of_mentors_in_pakistan_cricket | mentor role]] is distinct from typical franchise cricket mentorship, which often involves passive advisory roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

The mentors have a three-year contract and are required to dedicate 240 days a year to their duties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Four of the five mentors, including Younis Khan, Misbah-ul-Haq, Shoaib Malik, and Sarfaraz Ahmed, have captained the Pakistan cricket team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. They have the authority to select their own support staff, including spin bowling coaches, fast bowling coaches, physios, trainers, and head coaches, forming a complete team that works with players year-round at high-performance centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

The mentors' responsibilities extend beyond skill development to encompass comprehensive [[professionalism_and_player_development_in_pakistan | player development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This "all-encompassing role" focuses on:
*   **Grooming and Professionalism:** Instilling discipline and a professional mindset in players, beyond just cricketing skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   **Physical Preparation:** Guiding players on recovery from games, managing back-to-back matches, and implementing proper diet and nutritionist plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. This addresses the belief that talent alone is insufficient for sustained consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
*   **Player Pathways:** Working with various teams, including women's and men's Under-19 teams, to develop a pipeline of consistent performers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   **Strategic Input:** Mentors will deliver lectures on nutrition, training schedules, and off-season preparations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
*   **Reporting Structure:** Mentors report to a newly hired director at the PCB, who serves as a single point of contact for all their requirements and concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

### Domestic Cricket Overhaul
The current domestic season has a high volume of tournaments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. However, from the next year, the PCB plans to reduce the number of domestic tournaments to allow players more rest and time for personal development beyond skill training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>. The importance of reducing game load is emphasized to allow players time for reflection and improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>.

### Player Selection Criteria
A significant shift is intended in player selection. Historically, many new players were recruited primarily from T20 cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>. The new [[strategy_and_decisionmaking_in_cricket | strategy and decision-making]] will prioritize players who perform consistently over one or two seasons in 4-day and One Day Cricket formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>. This is because longer formats expose players to diverse match situations (favorable, even, and adverse), better preparing them for the demands of international Test and ODI cricket, where Pakistan has struggled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>.

## Challenges and Opportunities for Improvement

### Continuity and Stability
A key concern is the historical lack of continuity in PCB's structures, with new chairmen often dismantling previous systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>. There is a strong consensus that any new plan should be adhered to for "at least a couple of years" to allow results to materialize, with only minor adjustments made rather than starting "from scratch" after failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.

### NOC Policy and Player Welfare
The PCB's policy on No Objection Certificates (NOCs) for players participating in foreign leagues has been problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>. Instances where NOCs were denied, even after players had secured contracts, have deterred foreign franchises from picking Pakistani cricketers, potentially hindering player development and earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a>.

It is suggested that the PCB should not limit the number of leagues a player can participate in, but rather allow them to play during free windows, provided they prioritize domestic tournaments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a>. Playing in diverse global leagues helps players develop professionalism and adaptability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>.

### [[involvement_of_experienced_players_in_cricket_administration | Involvement of Experienced Players]]
A recurring recommendation for better governance is the inclusion of more cricketers in PCB's administrative setup, particularly in directorial roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>. The argument is that cricketers understand the nuances of the game, such as pitch preparation, and can make more informed decisions when collaborating with coaches and curators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:12">[00:36:12]</a>.

### Player Workload Management
Discussions have been held regarding the workload management of players, especially pace bowlers, to ensure they remain fresh and avoid injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>. The suggestion is to mix senior and junior players for home series against smaller sides, allowing newcomers international exposure and reducing the burden on established players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:48">[00:41:48]</a>. This also addresses the issue of players feeling insecure and playing every match, leading to fatigue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:15">[00:41:15]</a>.

The PCB has reportedly finalized international tours until 2027 and aims for similar clarity in domestic cricket schedules to aid player and board planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:45">[00:31:45]</a>. This increased clarity is expected to improve the overall functioning of Pakistan cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>.

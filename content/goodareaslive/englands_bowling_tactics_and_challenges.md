[[Englands Bowling Performance and Strategy | England's bowling performance]] during the match was described as "flapping like a fish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a> and as if the concept of bowling was new to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. They appeared confused between bowling full tossers and half-trackers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. India scored very easily throughout the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, exceeding the par score of 400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## General Performance and Tactical Errors

England ended the day "destroying England" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a> themselves, largely due to their bowling. They had no reviews left, meaning any chances they had were lost because decisions went against them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The opposition's wickets were primarily due to Indian batting errors rather than unplayable deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. Only one delivery might have kept a little low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

A significant issue was the high number of bad balls bowled. India bowled six full tosses with their spinners compared to England's 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. India bowled two short balls, while England bowled 22 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>. Furthermore, India bowled on a good length almost 70% of the time, whereas England was around 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>. This indicates England was not consistently putting the ball in a good area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>, leading to many overpitched balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>.

Under [[Englands cricket strategy under basball | Bazball]], England has been good at manufacturing wickets by forcing batters to take huge risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:24">[00:38:24]</a>. However, this approach didn't seem to work in this match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:33">[00:38:33]</a>. In Western countries, they can bowl short to take care of issues, but this is not possible in Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>. A more defensive mindset with a stacked field to bore India into hitting out was not fully pursued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:58">[00:38:58]</a>.

## Key Bowlers and Their Struggles

### Joe Root
Joe Root opened the bowling for England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a> and got a wicket almost immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. England's strategy was to use him as a matchup bowler, especially against left-handers, against whom he averages well (111 in first-class cricket against off-spin, and generally decent against left-handers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. In Asia, his performance against right-handers improves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.

Despite having three frontline spinners, Root had to bowl the second-most overs he's ever bowled in a Test innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>, indicating a significant issue with [[Englands Bowling Performance and Strategy | England's bowling options]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>. While Root bowled some very good "best balls," he also bowled many full tosses and struggled with line and length, sometimes bowling down the leg side or too short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>.

### Jack Leach
Jack Leach has not played for seven months and is bowling like someone who hasn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. He reportedly suffered from hamstring, knee, and back problems during the match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. He never bowled more than a seven-over spell and resorted to short, sharp spells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. His economy rate was 2.16, making him much better than the rest of [[Englands Bowling Performance and Strategy | England's bowlers]] in terms of economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a> and more accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.

However, due to his injuries (officially a sore knee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>), he bowled the same amount of overs as Tom Hartley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>, about 20 overs less than a normal expectation for a frontline spinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>. He didn't bowl many bad balls, but his best deliveries "didn't look particularly good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>.

### Mark Wood
Mark Wood's inclusion in India was questioned due to heat and lack of bounce neutralizing his strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">[00:30:57]</a>. However, he bowled a good first spell, putting pressure on batters like KL Rahul with short balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>. He also achieved reverse swing later in the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:14">[00:31:14]</a>. England's strategy was to use him for occasional short balls and reverse swing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>. Compared to more complete bowlers like Cummins or Hazlewood who can bowl cutters, Wood lacks that variation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>.

### Younger Spinners (Tom Hartley, Rehan Ahmed)
Tom Hartley, playing in his first game, and Rehan Ahmed struggled with their lengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>. Hartley gave away a wicket by bowling a half-tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. Both struggled to control their lengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:39">[00:33:39]</a>. Tom Hartley likely puts more side spin on the ball, but seemed to be "freaking out" about not getting enough spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:59">[00:43:59]</a>.

## Overall Challenges
England's bowlers struggled with landing the ball where they wanted to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. They don't have many options for spin bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:45">[00:34:45]</a>. Players like Will Jacks might bowl a lot of poor balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>, and Liam Dawson, while economical, is similar to Leach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>. Matt Parkinson lacks Rehan Ahmed's wrong'un <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:08">[00:35:08]</a>. Their "A" team spinner, Callum Parkinson, had an economy rate of 5.9 runs an over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:24">[00:35:24]</a>, highlighting the lack of strong alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>.

They appeared to be conserving energy at times, which made them look "flat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>. This is a common occurrence for Western teams in Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:36">[00:30:36]</a>.
England's slow overrate was a significant issue, losing 19 points due to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>. They were bowling at about 13 overs an hour and never caught up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:59">[00:29:59]</a>.# England's Bowling Tactics and Challenges

[[Englands Bowling Performance and Strategy | England's bowling performance]] during the match was described as "kind of flapping" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a> and as if the concept of bowling was new to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## General Performance and Tactical Errors

England ended the day "absolutely destroying England" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a> themselves, largely due to their bowling.

## Overall Challenges
[[Englands struggles and tactical errors in cricket | England's struggles]] with bowling were compounded by a lack of strong options. They don't have many options for spin bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:45">[00:34:45]</a>. Players like Will Jacks might bowl a lot of poor balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>, and Liam Dawson, while economical, is similar to Leach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>.

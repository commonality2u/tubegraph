From: [[goodareaslive]] <br/> 

The strategic use of spin bowlers in the death overs of a cricket match, particularly in T20s, is discussed as a unique and often underestimated approach to defending targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. While traditionally seamers dominate the final overs, certain spinners have proven exceptionally effective due to their unique skills and temperament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

## Key Attributes of Effective Death-Over Spinners

*   **Composure and Unfazed Demeanor** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>
*   **Wicket-Taking Ability**: Spinners can be significant wicket-taking options even in the death overs, which can completely derail an innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
*   **Difficulty to Score Boundaries**: Their variations and pace make it challenging for batters to hit boundaries, forcing them into risky doubles or singles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
*   **Pace Through the Air**: Quick delivery through the air can make them effective even with a wet ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
*   **Ability to Bowl Yorkers**: Although risky for spinners, some elite bowlers can consistently land yorkers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>.
*   **Variation and Deception**: Utilizing different types of deliveries like the doosra, carrom ball, or knuckle ball can keep batters guessing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>.

## Notable Spinners in Death Overs

### Rashid Khan
Rashid Khan is identified as a "unique spinner" capable of bowling effectively in any phase of a T20 game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. He is seen as a captain's confident choice to defend runs in the final over due to his ability to get batters out, unlike more defensive bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. His quickness through the air means he is not easily written off, even with a wet ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

### Jess Jonassen
Jess Jonassen is highlighted as a top spinner for defending targets, especially in women's cricket where spinners are more commonly seen bowling in the death overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. She is a wicket-taking option who rarely concedes more than seven or eight runs an over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. Her low arm action and ability to consistently bowl yorkers are considered remarkable skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. Jonassen has bowled the second most balls ever by a woman in the last two overs, with a bowling average of 12 and an economy of 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>. Her competitiveness and desire to win matches make her a strong choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>.

### Saqlain Mushtaq
Saqlain Mushtaq is recognized as a "hipster pick" from the 90s, who regularly bowled at the death for Pakistan in ODI cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>. His doosra was notoriously unreadable, baffling batters and making it difficult for them to pick his variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.

### Sunil Narine
Sunil Narine is noted for his ability to spin the ball both ways and his effective knuckle ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>. He is considered one of the best at bowling for singles, a crucial skill in death overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>. His four-over spells often feature binary scores (e.g., 1-0, 1-0), highlighting his control and effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>. Peak Narine consistently bowled effectively in the death overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>.

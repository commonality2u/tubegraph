Episode 29 of the Crick Piics podcast featured a discussion and draft to create the "best current T20 World 12" team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. The podcast is hosted by Bam Kazi (@def_mango) and Estelle Vasudevan (@Estelle_vasu_1), with Rob Baron (@mosio_judge) from Cricket 8 joining as an "impact sub" for Jared Kimber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>.

## Draft Rules and Considerations

The primary rule for this draft was that only *current form* mattered, not past records, and players had to be *still active* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. The draft followed a snake-style format, with the pick order going 1-2-3, then 3-2-1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. Each participant received four picks, aiming for a 12-man squad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. Rob Baron was given the first pick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. The overall [[analysis_of_strategies_for_t20_team_selection | strategy for T20 team selection]] focused heavily on recent [[form_and_strategy_adjustments_in_t20_cricket | player form]].

## Player Selections and Justifications

### Rob Baron's Picks

1.  **Jasprit Bumrah** (Bowler) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>
    *   **Justification:** Considered the "open goal" for the number one pick and the "best all format cricketer in contemporary Cricket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. He's described as unplayable, having a "never-ending bag of tricks," and being able to bowl in all phases, bowl dry, and take wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. His current form is at his peak, even after injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.
2.  **Matheesha Pathirana** (Bowler) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>
    *   **Justification:** Described as a "gun" and the best strike bowler in white-ball cricket alongside Bumrah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. His unique angle and release point make him an outlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. His current form is "really really good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>, and he's seen as the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.
3.  **Andre Russell** (All-rounder) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>
    *   **Justification:** Still going strong and bringing experience with the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>. He's noted for his ability to bowl short deliveries effectively in the middle overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. As a batter, he's "ludicrous" and can adapt his game, hitting the ball "hardest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. He's seen as a blueprint for an all-round T20 cricketer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.
4.  **David Miller** (Batter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>
    *   **Justification:** Miller is capable of two things: staying in when in trouble and playing big innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. He played one of the best innings of the current [[t20_world_cup_2024_final_match_analysis | T20 World Cup]] on a tough New York pitch against the Netherlands, demonstrating his ability to stand up when the going is tough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.

### Bam Kazi's Picks

1.  **Travis Head** (Opener) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>
    *   **Justification:** He has "evolved into this new kind of Beast" as an opener, hitting from ball one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. His [[performance_of_specific_players_in_t20_world_cup_2024 | performance]] in the IPL for Sunrisers Hyderabad and for Australia, particularly against England in the [[t20_world_cup_2024_final_match_analysis | T20 World Cup]] (where Australia won the power play), exemplifies modern T20 batting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>. He's also a "big game player" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>. His approach simplifies the game, leading to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>. This represents a significant shift in [[t20_cricket_evolution | T20 cricket evolution]].
2.  **Suryakumar Yadav** (Batter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>
    *   **Justification:** Suryakumar has "disrupted the game" and "changed T20 cricket" with his 360-degree play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>. His ability to hit across lengths and perform on tough batting conditions, like his match-winning half-century for India vs. USA in New York, highlights his devastating ball-striking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. He makes shots that no one else can, showing immense physical control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.
3.  **Jos Buttler** (Opener/Wicket-keeper) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>
    *   **Justification:** Buttler's impact makes him difficult to overlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. He showed his ability to smash runs even after a mixed IPL season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. He's versatile, can play through different gears, and is a strong leader, making him a candidate for captaincy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. His ability to open with Travis Head creates a formidable top order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.
4.  **Trent Boult** (Bowler) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>
    *   **Justification:** Selected as a new ball bowler and to provide a left-arm seamer option, which was missing from the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. Despite New Zealand's early exit from the [[t20_world_cup_2024_final_match_analysis | T20 World Cup]], Boult's bowling was "literally unplayable," taking wickets and maintaining a low economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. He offers experience and the ability to hoop the ball, making him an "absolute gun at getting a wicket in the first over" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>.

### Estelle Vasudevan's Picks

1.  **Heinrich Klaasen** (Batter/Wicket-keeper) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>
    *   **Justification:** Arguably the "best batter in the world right now" and "phenomenal in that middle order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>. He has a massive impact on South Africa, offering hope in tough situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>. Klaasen is "tailor-made" for the middle overs phase, an "absolute monster versus spin," and has developed unique shots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>. His ability to score quickly while staying in is seen as "almost impossible" and a "cheat code" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a>.
2.  **Kuldeep Yadav** (Bowler) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:22:00">[14:22:00]</a>
    *   **Justification:** Selected as a bowler due to his "quality" and massive wicket-taking option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:00">[15:05:00]</a>. He offers "immense control for a left arm wrist spinner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26:00">[16:26:00]</a>. While acknowledged that other wrist spinners were available, Kuldeep's variations and status as one of the best spinners in the world made him a strong pick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:00">[16:03:00]</a>.
3.  **Nicholas Pooran** (Batter/Wicket-keeper) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:25">[32:25]</a>
    *   **Justification:** Considered "probably the best striker of the ball currently" behind Heinrich Klaasen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:30">[32:30]</a>. He provides a left-handed option in the middle order, which is important for matchups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:12">[33:12]</a>. Pooran can perform both as an opener and a finisher, and when he "starts hitting the ball he doesn't stop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:12">[34:12]</a>.
4.  **Rashid Khan** (All-rounder) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:13">[35:13]</a>
    *   **Justification:** Rashid Khan has been consistently good for a long time with few dips in form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:45">[35:45]</a>. His batting has come a long way, being able to clear boundaries easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:19">[35:19]</a>. His fielding is also highlighted as a key, often overlooked, facet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:05">[36:05]</a>. He is considered possibly the best wrist spinner to ever play T20 cricket and offers flexibility to bowl in any phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:13">[36:13]</a>.

### Unselected but Discussed Players
*   **Sunil Narine:** Deemed ineligible as he has not made himself available for the West Indies national team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:03:00">[21:03:00]</a>.
*   **Glenn Maxwell:** Not picked due to his "appalling form," especially during the IPL where he averaged seven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:40:00">[21:40:00]</a>.
*   **Virat Kohli:** Acknowledged for his strong IPL performance but his recent [[performance_of_specific_players_in_t20_world_cup_2024 | performance]] in the [[t20_world_cup_2024_final_match_analysis | T20 World Cup]] (five runs in three games in New York) made it difficult to place him ahead of the chosen top three batters (Head, Buttler, Sky) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:22:00">[44:22:00]</a>. His fielding, however, is praised as getting better with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:37:00">[50:37:00]</a>.
*   **Adam Zampa & Wanindu Hasaranga:** Mentioned as other strong leg-spinner options, but Rashid Khan was preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:36:00">[35:36:00]</a>. Hasaranga's recent [[performance_of_specific_players_in_t20_world_cup_2024 | T20 World Cup]] batting form was a deterrent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:36:00">[41:36:00]</a>.
*   **Glenn Phillips:** Considered, but Miller was chosen over him based on current form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:59:00">[46:59:00]</a>.
*   **Sikandar Raza:** Suggested as a potential 12th man for his off-spinning option and recent form, though Zimbabwe's absence from the [[t20_world_cup_2024_final_match_analysis | T20 World Cup]] was noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:11:00">[47:11:00]</a>.
*   **Akeal Hosein:** Considered by Bam for his deeper batting lineup contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:05:00">[48:05:00]</a>.
*   **Phil Salt:** Considered by Estelle as an alternative opener to Travis Head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:31:00">[48:31:00]</a>.
*   **Mitchell Marsh:** Mentioned as a flexible number three option but not in the best of form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:58:00">[48:58:00]</a>.
*   **Mustafizur Rahman (Fizz):** Considered for his effectiveness on slow wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:38:00">[49:38:00]</a>.
*   **Shaheen Afridi:** Noted for dropping off in form, possibly due to being over-bowled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:49:00">[49:49:00]</a>.

## Final Combined T20 World 12

The combined team, based on the draft picks and discussion, consists of:

*   **Openers:** [[player_roles_and_strategies_in_t20_cricket | Travis Head]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:18:00">[53:18:00]</a>, [[player_roles_and_strategies_in_t20_cricket | Jos Buttler]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:19:00">[53:19:00]</a>
*   **Batters:** [[player_roles_and_strategies_in_t20_cricket | Suryakumar Yadav]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:20:00">[53:20:00]</a>, [[player_roles_and_strategies_in_t20_cricket | Nicholas Pooran]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:23:00">[53:23:00]</a>, [[player_roles_and_strategies_in_t20_cricket | Heinrich Klaasen]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:24:00">[53:24:00]</a>, [[player_roles_and_strategies_in_t20_cricket | David Miller]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:25:00">[53:25:00]</a>
*   **All-rounders:** [[player_roles_and_strategies_in_t20_cricket | Andre Russell]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:26:00">[53:26:00]</a>, [[player_roles_and_strategies_in_t20_cricket | Rashid Khan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:28:00">[53:28:00]</a>
*   **Bowlers:** [[player_roles_and_strategies_in_t20_cricket | Jasprit Bumrah]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:29:00">[53:29:00]</a>, [[player_roles_and_strategies_in_t20_cricket | Trent Boult]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:30:00">[53:30:00]</a>, [[player_roles_and_strategies_in_t20_cricket | Matheesha Pathirana]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:33:00">[53:33:00]</a>
*   **12th Man (flex option):** Kuldeep Yadav (or Pathirana, if Pathirana is in the main 11) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:33:00">[53:33:00]</a>.

The hosts felt the team has strong explosive batters up to number five but then a long tail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:35:00">[35:35:00]</a>. However, it was noted that with multiple all-rounders, the batting depth is considerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:43:00">[45:43:00]</a>. The [[batting_order_strategy_in_t20_cricket | batting order strategy]] is considered malleable for the best teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:15:00">[51:15:00]</a>.

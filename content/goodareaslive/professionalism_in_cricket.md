Concerns regarding [[Cricket and player performances | player performances]] and conduct, particularly concerning Australian cricketer Glenn Maxwell, have frequently been raised in cricket discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Issues with Professionalism

Glenn Maxwell has been described as "not the most liked individual in Indian cricket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. While acknowledged as an "incredible talent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, his approach to the Indian Premier League (IPL) has been criticized, with observations that he appears to treat it as a "vacation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

There have been "terrible stories" circulating about Maxwell, highlighting a significant "lack or the absence of professionalism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This concern about his professionalism is not exclusive to his time in India; it was also a "big thing about him in Australia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Financial Returns vs. Potential

Despite consistent payment, often exceeding a million dollars annually, Maxwell is perceived by franchises in the Indian Premier League as having "pulled the rug" over them for a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Critics state that he has not "come up to scratch or lived up to his potential" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, leading to ongoing discussions about how a player of his caliber, based purely on potential, has maintained such high earnings without consistently delivering results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

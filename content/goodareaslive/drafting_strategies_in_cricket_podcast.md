Episode 19 of the Crick picks podcast features a draft-style discussion where hosts select their top five players for a particular cricket category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The podcast aims to delve into the reasoning and [[strategy and decisionmaking in cricket | strategies]] behind player selections based on specific criteria.

## Podcast Format and Topic

The "Crick picks podcast" is a draft-style program where participants choose their top five players or elements related to a specific cricket category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. For this episode, the topic is "All-format players currently playing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Players must be active in all three formats of cricket (Test, ODI, and T20 Internationals) to qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. For example, David Warner, who still plays T20 Internationals but is retired from Tests and ODIs, does not qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The draft follows a snake-style order (1-2-3, then 3-2-1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## All-Format Player Selections and Justifications

### Jasprit Bumrah
Jasprit Bumrah was the first pick, described as arguably the best bowler or cricketer across all three formats currently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Despite occasionally missing games, his availability makes him unparalleled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. His recent performance against England reminded observers of his elite test bowling capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. He is considered the most skillful pacer of his generation, known for pinpoint execution, defensive bowling with nagging lengths, Yorkers, and making batters "look like absolute amateurs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Bumrah has also revolutionized the perception that limited-overs bowlers cannot succeed in Test cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

### Kagiso Rabada
Kagiso Rabada was chosen as the second pick due to his consistent wicket-taking threat across all formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. While some questioned his T20 performance due to high runs conceded at times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>, his average of 23 in T20s and guaranteed wickets in other formats solidified his spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

### Rohit Sharma
Rohit Sharma was picked third, praised for his phenomenal recent form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. His approach in the ODI World Cup, shifting from run accumulation to aggressive powerplay hitting, was highlighted as a game-changer for India's batting order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. As a Test opener, he has been a revelation, especially overseas, known for attacking batting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

### Mitch Marsh
Mitch Marsh, dubbed "the Bison," was considered a "hipster pick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. His return to the Test side for the Ashes provided Australia with liberty in the low-middle order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. Marsh is essential to Australia's T20 team, having been a key player in their T20 World Cup win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. His utility and consistent role fulfillment across all three formats were emphasized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

### Virat Kohli
Virat Kohli was selected despite perceived decline, with his recent numbers indicating strong performances: a Test average of 42 (with two hundreds in 12 games), an ODI average of 64 at a run-a-ball, and a T20 International average of 53 with a strike rate of 140 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. His 2023 IPL season saw him average 50 at a strike rate of 139 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. It was argued that even a "not the Virat he used to be" Kohli is still better than many other players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

### Babar Azam
Babar Azam's selection acknowledged his solid record across formats but also recent criticisms of his approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. His struggles in Test cricket (averaging 22 in 2023) and inconsistent ODI performances against top nations were noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>. However, his recent PSL performance suggested a potential upturn in his limited-overs game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.

### Kuldeep Yadav
Kuldeep Yadav's pick highlighted his performance against England, which showcased his value as a bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>. His story of overcoming career low points and developing into an indispensable player, particularly in the long format in India, was praised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>. He is seen as "the most talented spinner going around" and a consistent wicket-taking option in limited-overs cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>.

### Daryl Mitchell
Daryl Mitchell's selection recognized his "incredible story" and peak form across formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>. He played impactful innings in T20 and ODI World Cups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>, and is considered one of the best Test batters globally, achieving this without bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>.

### Shubman Gill
Shubman Gill was picked as a youngster with a glittering future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>. His ODI record is exceptional (averaging 61 over 44 games) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>, and he has shown immense potential in T20 cricket in the IPL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>. Despite initial questions about his Test career, he "silenced all of those people" with his performance in the recent series against England, scoring key hundreds in the third and fourth innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>.

### Naseem Shah
Naseem Shah was considered a "projection pick" but is seen as Pakistan's best seamer with a higher ceiling than Shaheen Afridi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>. His injury in the ODI World Cup exposed weaknesses in Pakistan's bowling attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>. Naseem can bowl in all phases in limited-overs cricket and has a "pinpoint accuracy" and "nagging lengths" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>. He consistently performs well in Test cricket and is a handy lower-order batter, scoring crucial runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a>.

### Mohammed Shami
Mohammed Shami was chosen for his recent improvement as a T20 bowler, having been considered "terrible" in the format previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>. In the last IPL season, he had a bowling average of 18 and an economy of eight runs an over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>. He is recognized as an ODI great, especially in World Cups, and his Test bowling has always been strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>. He is excellent at taking early wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>.

### Josh Hazlewood
Josh Hazlewood was picked as another bowler often pigeonholed as a Test specialist but has performed surprisingly well in limited-overs cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. In the last two years, he took 58 Test wickets at 21, and in ODIs, he averaged 29 with an economy of 4.74 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:42">[00:33:42]</a>. In T20 Internationals, he averaged 25 with an economy of 7.94 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>. He is known for getting early wickets and being economical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:45">[00:34:45]</a>.

### Ravindra Jadeja
Ravindra Jadeja was chosen as a strong all-rounder, particularly impactful with the ball in limited-overs cricket despite India playing on flat tracks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:45">[00:35:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>. While his T20 bowling numbers may not always look brilliant, his death hitting and exceptional [[fielding_skills_and_techniques_in_cricket | fielding]] make him a net positive player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:16">[00:37:16]</a>. He has also been quite handy in ODI cricket and absolutely fantastic in Test cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:30">[00:37:30]</a>.

### Matt Henry
Matt Henry was selected for his strong performances in all three formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>. In the last couple of years, he has averaged 25 in Test cricket, 27 in ODI cricket with an economy of five, and 23 in T20 cricket with an economy of 7.8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:11">[00:39:11]</a>. He is known as a very effective new-ball bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>, possessing incredible skill, accuracy, and good energy on the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>. He is considered New Zealand's best all-format bowler after Trent Boult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>.

### Mohammad Rizwan
Mohammad Rizwan was picked as a "hipster pick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>, acknowledging his T20 strike rate as an issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>. However, he offers "sure shot runs" and can anchor innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:53">[00:43:53]</a>. In ODI cricket, he is a safe middle-order choice, averaging 40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:04">[00:43:04]</a>. In Test cricket, he is considered Pakistan's best wicketkeeper-batter, averaging over 40 in 30 matches, with most of his runs coming away from home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:20">[00:43:20]</a>. His wicketkeeping also adds significant value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:37">[00:44:37]</a>.

## Reflections on Drafting All-Format Players
The drafting process revealed that there are more qualifying all-format players than initially anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:31">[00:53:31]</a>. The challenge lies in balancing current form with a player's overall historical prowess and potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. The discussion also highlighted how players are often "pigeonholed" into specific formats by selectors or public perception, even if their skills transcend those boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. The unique demands and [[cricket strategies and game analysis | strategic roles]] within each format (Test, ODI, T20) influence player value and selection dilemmas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

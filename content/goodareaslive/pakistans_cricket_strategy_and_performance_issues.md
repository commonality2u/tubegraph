Pakistan's cricket team has been facing significant [[management_and_structural_issues_within_pakistan_cricket | management and structural issues]], leading to a series of dismal performances, notably exemplified by their record-shattering loss to England in the Multan Test match in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This defeat highlighted deep-seated problems within the team's [[pakistans_batting_performance_critique | batting]], bowling, and overall strategy.

## Record-Breaking Losses

Pakistan recorded a historic loss in Multan, becoming the first team in 147 years of Test Cricket to lose by an innings after posting over 500 runs in their first innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:25]</a>. The team is now on an 11-match winless streak at home, marking their worst-ever run. This streak includes four draws and seven losses, a significant deterioration compared to their previous 1969-1975 winless streak, which had only one loss among 10 draws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:46]</a>. Their last Test win at home was in February 2021 against South Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:09:01]</a>. Under Captain Shan Masood, Pakistan has suffered six consecutive Test losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:18]</a>. This period is arguably the [[challenges_and_opportunities_for_pakistan_cricket | lowest ebb in Pakistan's storied cricketing history]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:23]</a>, transforming them from a "Mercurial team" capable of galvanizing to a "consistently poor" side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:39]</a>.

## Batting Performance and Collapse

Despite scoring 556 runs in 149 overs in the first innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:51">[00:42:54]</a>, Pakistan's [[pakistans_batting_collapse_and_analysis | batting collapsed]] dramatically in the third innings. The team appeared "mentally and physically toast," exhibiting "tired shots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:11]</a>. They scored 220 runs in the third innings, which, while an improvement from previous collapses, was still inadequate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:13]</a>. The mindset was criticized for not attempting to bat out for a draw, opting for attacking shots instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:13:03]</a>.

### Individual Batting Concerns
*   **Abdullah Shafique**: Scored 102 in the first innings but was dismissed by a "lazy shot" on the first ball in the second innings, reflecting a pattern of high scores followed by terrible failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:16:15]</a>.
*   **Saud Shakeel**: His dismissal in the second innings was labeled "the worst shot I have seen in a long time," especially concerning for a player expected to be excellent against spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:26]</a>.
*   **Shan Masood**: Despite a thrilling 151 in the first innings, playing with "Bazball" aggression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:30]</a>, his second innings dismissal (caught after two drops) was deemed "appalling" given his captaincy role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:18:04]</a>. He was criticized for failing to set a defensive tone for the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:05]</a>.
*   **Babar Azam**: Currently enduring a lean patch with 18 Test innings without a 50+ score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:47]</a>. His dismissals were attributed to poor technical issues, indicating a mental and technical struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:50]</a>. His struggles have a "knock-on effect to the whole of the batting lineup" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:20]</a>.
*   **Mohammad Rizwan**: Only scored 10 runs in two innings, including a duck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:05]</a>.
*   **Salman Ali Agha**: One of the few to show resilience, scoring an unbeaten 104 and 63 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:21]</a>.
*   **Aamir Jamal**: Scored an unbeaten 55, also showing character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:24]</a>.

The overall sentiment is that the expected leaders of the [[challenges_faced_by_pakistans_batting_lineup | batting lineup]] have gone missing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:31]</a>.

## Bowling Performance and Challenges

Pakistan's [[pakistans_bowling_challenges_in_the_world_cup | bowling challenges]] are severe, taking only seven wickets in England's 150-over innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:15">[01:14:17]</a>. This is abysmal compared to Jack Leach's seven wickets alone in the match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:30">[01:14:32]</a>. In their last 11 home Tests, Pakistan has only managed 135 wickets, averaging just over 12 wickets per game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:36">[01:14:45]</a>. Six Pakistani bowlers conceded over 100 runs in the match, equaling a record held by Zimbabwe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:47">[01:14:54]</a>.

### Strategic and Personnel Issues
*   **Negative Bowling Lines**: Under Shan Masood's captaincy, bowlers like Abra were seen bowling ineffective "negative lines" outside leg stump to well-set batsmen like Harry Brook and Joe Root, a strategy that is "inherently flawed" and non-attacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:22:11]</a>. This prevented them from taking wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:22:00]</a>.
*   **Over-bowling and Injuries**: There's a concern about over-bowling key pace bowlers like Naseem Shah, who bowled 31 overs in the first innings despite being injury-prone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:36">[00:22:48]</a>. Shaheen Shah Afridi's speeds are also down, and his lateral movement has decreased, likely due to being over-bowled and not properly rehabilitated after injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:27:05]</a>. This issue impacts the team's ability to maintain a strong [[role_of_pakistans_bowling_and_fielding_in_the_match | bowling attack]].
*   **Lack of Spinners**: Pakistan faces a "serious death of spinners" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:02]</a>. Abra's performance was disappointing, and he broke down during the match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:05">[01:15:10]</a>. There is no clear replacement, with options like Nauman Ali and Zafar Gohar having their own issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:13">[01:15:26]</a>.
*   **Comparison to England**: While Pakistan's bowling attack might appear stronger on paper than England's inexperienced attack in this match, England's bowlers focused on taking wickets and employed attacking fields and strategies, unlike Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:07">[01:19:22]</a>. [[indias_bowling_strategies_and_performance | England's bowling strategies]] ultimately proved more effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:07">[01:19:11]</a>.

## Captaincy Under Scrutiny

Shan Masood's captaincy decisions were heavily criticized. Beyond the negative bowling lines, he delayed taking the second new ball by 5.2 overs, despite the old ball offering no purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:34]</a>. His winless streak of six matches as captain has put his position under significant threat, with rumors of his removal circulating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:23:08]</a>.

## Pitch Conditions and Home Advantage

The Multan pitch was a "terrible excuse of a cricket pitch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:50]</a>, described as a "rock hard" "absolute Highway" that resembled a Day 1 pitch even on Day 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:41]</a>. Preparing such a flat deck against England's "Bazball" approach was seen as a "death wish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:05]</a>. England's score of 823 runs at a rate of 5.5 runs per over compared to Pakistan's 556 at 3.7 runs per over in similar overs, with England hitting fewer sixes, demonstrated England's strategic success in accumulating runs via singles and twos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:44:26]</a>.

The inability to prepare a pitch that suits their strengths or counter the opposition's aggressive style is a significant failure in utilizing [[challenges_and_opportunities_for_pakistan_cricket | home advantage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:26">[00:34:30]</a>. A surface where 450 runs are "under par" is considered "unfit for Test Cricket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:34]</a>.

## Underlying Structural and Management Issues

The issues extend beyond on-field performance to the [[management_and_structural_issues_within_pakistan_cricket | administration]] of Pakistan cricket. Problems include:
*   Volatility and instability in the board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:24]</a>.
*   Mediocrity and incompetence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:29]</a>.
*   Lack of continuity in domestic structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:30]</a>.
*   Poor injury management and workload management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:33]</a>.

These deep-rooted problems suggest that a mere captaincy change will not fix the team's predicament, as there are "no easy fixes" or "stop gap solutions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:45]</a>. The team lacks the structure and process necessary for sustained success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:53]</a>.

## Fielding Lapses

Both teams exhibited poor fielding, with nine dropped catches in the Test match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:57">[00:47:58]</a>. Pakistan had crucial drops by Babar Azam and Saud Shakeel, while England's Ollie Pope alone dropped multiple catches and missed a run-out chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:30">[00:47:10]</a>. The "shitty" outfield also contributed to fatigue, with fielders having to run more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:54">[00:59:58]</a>.

## Conclusion

Pakistan cricket is currently in a state of "downward spiral" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:56">[00:54:56]</a>, described as "consistently poor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:50">[02:08:50]</a>. The team's physical and mental incapability to claw back into contests, coupled with tactical ineptitude and severe structural issues, paints a gloomy picture for the future. The flavor that Pakistan cricket once added to Test cricket is arguably "gone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a>.

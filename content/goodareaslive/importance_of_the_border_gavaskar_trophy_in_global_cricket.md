The Border Gavaskar Trophy (BGT) is a Test cricket series contested between India and Australia, which has grown significantly in global importance, with many considering it bigger than The Ashes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:27">[01:44:27]</a>.

## Evolution of the Rivalry

Before the 2000s, the BGT was not considered a major series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:48">[01:47:48]</a>. The rivalry began to intensify around the [[important_test_series_victories_in_cricket_history | 2001 series in India]], where VVS Laxman scored 280 runs and India won in Kolkata after being made to follow on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:12">[01:49:12]</a>. This was followed by the Rahul Dravid game in Adelaide, where India drew 1-1 in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. Australia later defeated India in 2004 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:05">[02:05:05]</a>.

For many years, the home side consistently won the series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:33">[02:07:33]</a>. However, the dynamic shifted with India winning two consecutive series in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:48">[02:10:48]</a>. The current series is seen as an opportunity for India to secure a "three-peat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:30">[02:13:30]</a>.

Jared Kimber suggests the rivalry intensified even in the late 1990s as Australia became dominant and India emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:32">[02:27:32]</a>. He attributes the increased significance to India eventually developing strong bowlers, which changed the power dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:40">[02:41:40]</a>. Initially, the series was primarily for fans in India and Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:07">[02:56:07]</a>. However, with cricket's world pivoting significantly towards India, it's now "very hard for anything not to be big if India is involved anymore" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:04">[03:10:04]</a>.

The 2008 series is identified as a "huge flash point" that altered the power dynamic and preceded the emergence of the IPL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:37">[03:37:37]</a>. Australia, traditionally dismissive of other nations, began calling India the "final frontier" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:12">[04:04:12]</a>. Steve Waugh is credited with emphasizing that winning in India was as important as winning the Ashes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:59">[04:18:58]</a>. Adam Gilchrist reportedly viewed the 2004 series victory in India as his biggest accomplishment in an Australian Test shirt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:41">[04:41:41]</a>.

## Modern Significance and Subplots

The current [[border_gavaskar_trophy_rivalry_between_india_and_australia | Border Gavaskar Trophy]] series is characterized by significant subplots:
*   **India's pursuit of a three-peat** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:45">[05:04:45]</a>.
*   **Australia seeking revenge** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:55">[05:06:55]</a>.
*   **Crucial for World Test Championship final qualification** for both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:59">[05:09:59]</a>.
*   The perception that Australia and India are the two best teams in Test cricket currently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:19">[05:47:19]</a>.
*   The fact that India has become competitive and good even in Australia contributes to the series' importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:05">[06:21:05]</a>. Beating Australia, even "crap Australian sides," has always been a significant achievement for other nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:17">[06:46:17]</a>.

### Identity and Rivalry Intensity
Cricket is deeply intertwined with identity in the subcontinent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:04">[07:37:04]</a>. The series has become "feisty," with tempers flaring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:30">[07:51:30]</a>. Examples include Tim Paine "slagging off" Ravi Ashwin, only for Rishabh Pant to win the Test match at the Gabba, which was considered an Australian fortress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:19">[07:54:19]</a>. This combative nature between the teams enhances the spectacle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:39">[08:11:39]</a>.

The rise of social media has further amplified the rivalry, providing platforms for conflict and discussion between fans and even players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>. Australian cricketers were early adopters of Twitter, contributing to the "conflict that comes from that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:09">[09:27:09]</a>. Promotions and advertisements for the BGT have become more glamorous, building significant hype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:23">[09:53:23]</a>.

## Team Challenges and Series Impact

Both teams face significant challenges. Australia's batting lineup is unsettled, particularly with Cameron Green's absence disrupting their balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:44">[10:09:44]</a>. Their top four is considered "risky" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:21">[15:01:21]</a>. India also faces issues, with their captain Rohit Sharma unavailable for the first Test and Shubman Gill injured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:06:03">[26:06:03]</a>. Their batting order is not settled, and key bowler Mohammed Shami is also unavailable for at least the first two Tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:25:35">[26:25:35]</a>.

The nature of Australian pitches, with the reinforced Kookaburra ball and generally "result pitches" in the Sheffield Shield, has seen batting averages drop significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:02">[13:31:02]</a>. This creates a less predictable game environment, similar to how Indian domestic pitches became more favorable to seam bowling, affecting their batters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:35:46">[14:35:46]</a>.

The importance of fitness, particularly for bowlers like Jasprit Bumrah, is high in a five-Test series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:56:06">[23:56:06]</a>. However, the presence of various injuries and lack of trusted bowling all-rounders (like Hardik Pandya for India or Cameron Green for Australia) can impact team flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:42:30">[20:42:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:00:27">[22:00:27]</a>.

## Legacy and Future Implications

The series is seen as potentially career-defining for "greats on either sides" like Steve Smith and Virat Kohli, given their age and the possibility it could be the last time they face each other in Test cricket in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:54:19">[34:54:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:06:33">[35:06:33]</a>. Retirements are even predicted at the end of the series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:30:23">[35:30:23]</a>.

Both teams are described as "aging" but intensely "hungry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:49:18">[35:49:18]</a>. The drive to win the World Test Championship final is a major motivator, making both sides automatically hungry for victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:21:00">[37:21:00]</a>. Australia feels "pissed off" that India has performed so well in Australia recently and aims to "smash India into the ground" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:48:07">[36:48:07]</a>. India, having won twice in a row, has the chance to "completely flip the narrative" and achieve one of the "biggest ever achievements for Indian cricket," including World Cups, if they secure a three-peat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:46:17">[38:46:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:31:47">[39:31:47]</a>.

The recent Indian victories had "asterisks": the first without Smith and Warner, and the second with India losing players to injury and Kohli's absence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:09:29">[39:09:29]</a>. A third consecutive win, especially with current injury concerns, would be "absolutely incredible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:00:19">[39:00:19]</a>. The hope for a close series, potentially going to a decider in Sydney, underscores its global significance and entertainment value for cricket fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:06:46">[51:06:46]</a>.

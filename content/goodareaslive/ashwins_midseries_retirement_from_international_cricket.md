[[Ravi Chandran Ashwins cricket legacy | Ravichandran Ashwin]], a bonafide Test legend and absolute legend of the game, announced his shock retirement from international cricket mid-series. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:32">[01:05:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a> This decision came as a surprise to many, especially given its timing during a series in Australia. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:32">[01:05:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>

## Reasons and Context

It was communicated to Ashwin that he was not part of India's plans for the [[SCG | SCG]] Test. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a> The podcast host expressed being "baffled" by this decision, believing Ashwin should have played there. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a> However, it was noted that spinners averaged 52 at the [[SCG | SCG]] in the four years prior to this series. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>

The hosts suggest that a "grown-up conversation" likely took place, where Ashwin was informed he would be used in Adelaide but not expected to play in other games or much in England. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a> This put him in a position to decide if he wanted to wait around until the next home summer, being primarily a backup spinner for home tests. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a> The decision appears to be a mutual, mature one between Ashwin and Indian cricket. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>

Factors influencing his decision include:
*   **Age:** Ashwin will be around 39 when India is next slated to play home tests, making a long wait difficult at that age. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>
*   **Squad Depth:** India possesses a "ridiculous stock of spinners," including a tall off-spinner who is a better bat, [[Ravindra Jadeja | Jadeja]], [[Ravindra Jadeja | Jadeja]]'s backup Axar Patel, and Kuldeep Yadav. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>
*   **Personal Philosophy:** He is perceived as someone who would "never want to overstay his welcome" and made a clear-cut decision. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>
*   **Rumors:** There were rumors that Ashwin was considering retirement, which [[Rohit Sharmas fitness and future in international cricket | Rohit Sharma]] had heard and discussed with him in Perth. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>

> "It's a very dyes sort of retirement mid Series in Australia that as well." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>

While fans might have preferred a farewell test, Ashwin clearly did not prioritize that, and his decision is respected. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a> The situation is deemed "very dissimilar" to Graeme Swann's retirement, where Swann's arm gave way and England was desperate for him, unlike Ashwin who had other players around. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>

## Career Highlights and Legacy

Ashwin's career statistics are immense:
*   **Tests:** 106 matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>
*   **Wickets:** 537 at an average of 24. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>
*   **Five-wicket hauls (fifers):** 37 (tied with [[Shane Warne | Warne]] for second most). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>
*   **Ten-wicket hauls (teners):** 8 (fifth most, level with [[Anil Kumble | Kumble]]). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>
*   **Bowling Average by Country:** 28 in England, 42 in Australia (where he "kept getting better with age"). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>
*   **Runs:** 353 runs at 25.75 average, with six tons and 14 fifties in 151 innings (a 50+ score every 7.5 innings). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>
*   **Dismissals by handedness:** 269 right-handed batters, 268 left-handed batters, demonstrating he is not just a destroyer of left-handed batters. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>

His intelligence and wit are highlighted as setting him apart, leaving a "killer legacy" as one of the best players in cricket history. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a> He is considered by some to be the greatest Indian spinner of all time, and possibly the best after [[Shane Warne | Warne]] and [[Muttiah Muralitharan | Muralitharan]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a> While there's debate about him versus [[Anil Kumble | Kumble]], with arguments about bowling on flat vs. helpful decks, Ashwin's ability to bowl well on flat decks is acknowledged, as is [[Anil Kumble | Kumble]]'s potential on spinning decks. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a> His tactical brain, variations (carrom ball, angle, pace), and contributions to field settings made him a valuable "all-rounder" beyond just bowling and batting. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>

He demonstrated improvement, being brilliant in the West Indies and South Africa, and learning to be good in Australia. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a> England is noted as the only place where he consistently struggled. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>

## Future Endeavors

Ashwin has consistently been a "thorough gentleman" and a "great ambassador for Indian cricket and Cricket overall". <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a> Given his deep understanding of the sport, a "solid career in media" is anticipated, as he relishes delving into the "nitty-gritties" and is a "proper nerd." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a> It's expected that this is "not the last of [[Ravi Chandran Ashwins cricket legacy | Ravichandran Ashwin]] we've seen in cricket" and he will continue to contribute. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>

It's believed Ashwin "could revolutionize Cricket media" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:00">[10:26:00]</a> and "change how we talk about Cricket". <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a> He's credited with making the [[The strategic use of retired out tactics in T20 cricket | Mankad]] mainstream and for his innovative approach to "retired outs." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a> He is a "forward thinker" who has been frustrated by the state of cricket media and has the communication skills to challenge it. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a>

His self-description, "the cricket nut in me will never come to an end," reflects his enduring passion. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:13:00">[14:13:00]</a> He has never shied away from being a fan, seeking new information, or doing unpopular things, demonstrating "strength of character." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">[14:17:00]</a>

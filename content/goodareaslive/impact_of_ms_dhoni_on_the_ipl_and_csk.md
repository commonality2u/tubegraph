Concerns and rumors regarding [[ms_dhoni_impact_on_ipl_and_csk | MS Dhoni's]] potential retirement have circulated, particularly after his parents attended a game, and discussions around his knee issues from Stephen Fleming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Despite these discussions, [[ms_dhoni_impact_on_ipl_and_csk | Dhoni]] is still considered a "plus player" in the [[impact_of_ipl_on_player_performance_and_intercountry_cricket_dynamics | IPL]] due to his hitting ability and wicket-keeping skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

## Batting Style and Strategic Role

While [[ms_dhoni_impact_on_ipl_and_csk | Dhoni]] currently bats around number nine, his value remains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. A noticeable change in his batting is that he now takes more time to "get off the blocks," which is a stark contrast to the current aggressive, "hammering tongs" style of modern cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. He hails from an era where batters would get their "eye in" before becoming aggressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

A suggested strategic change for [[issues_facing_chennai_super_kings_csk_in_ipl | CSK]] to maximize [[ms_dhoni_impact_on_ipl_and_csk | Dhoni's]] batting is to have him bat at number three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This would allow him to face more balls (30-35 balls) and potentially score significantly, even a century if he plays 60 balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. If his body is strained from keeping, Devon Conway or another player could take over wicket-keeping duties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

### Impact on [[the_impact_of_ipl_performances_on_young_players | Young Players]]

Having [[ms_dhoni_impact_on_ipl_and_csk | Dhoni]] bat at number three would provide invaluable "lessons in [[impact_of_ipl_on_player_performance_and_intercountry_cricket_dynamics | IPL]] cricket" for younger players like Shivam Dube and others batting at numbers five and six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. This mentorship, similar to the experience of batting with Sachin Tendulkar, could profoundly enrich their development in a condensed manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

### [[the_role_of_team_dynamics_and_strategies_in_ipl_cricket | Rebuilding Phase]] for [[issues_facing_chennai_super_kings_csk_in_ipl | CSK]]

It is suggested that [[issues_facing_chennai_super_kings_csk_in_ipl | CSK]] may be in denial about being in a rebuilding phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. Acknowledging this, and framing [[ms_dhoni_impact_on_ipl_and_csk | Dhoni's]] continued presence as part of this process, would make strategic decisions easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Batting him higher could enable him to perform at his best, as his skill remains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

## Wicket-keeping Abilities

[[ms_dhoni_impact_on_ipl_and_csk | Dhoni]] is widely recognized for having the fastest wicket-keeping hands in cricket, attributed to his unique technique of not having "any give" and using his pads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. His childhood coach reportedly trained him using a motorbike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. There is a desire for more comparative data on his stumping speeds against other wicket-keepers to contextualize his reported timings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

Despite competitive claims, [[ms_dhoni_impact_on_ipl_and_csk | Dhoni]]'s consistency in not fumbling, unlike many other fast-handed wicket-keepers, makes his dismissals highly watched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. He has set records for stumpings globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

## Physical Condition

Concerns about [[ms_dhoni_impact_on_ipl_and_csk | Dhoni's]] knees have been raised, though his knees are reportedly "fine." The main issue might be his calves "taking up a big chunk of his load," which are overworking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. His body type, with "big butt and big thighs," is noted as not ideal for avoiding old-age leg injuries, especially for a runner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. He is also noted as being four years older than the speaker, placing him around 44 years old, though he "looks 22" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.

## Legacy and Future

There is a strong desire for [[ms_dhoni_impact_on_ipl_and_csk | Dhoni]], alongside other cricket legends like Virat Kohli and Ricky Ponting, to retire "on a high" rather than "dwindle and then go away" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>. This is seen as critical for the betterment of the game, as these players inspire future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:35">[00:47:35]</a>.

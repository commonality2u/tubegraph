The strength and depth of India's ODI team, particularly in their bowling attack, are significantly bolstered by the presence of high-quality [[role_of_allrounders_in_cricket_teams | all-rounders]] like Hardik Pandya and Ravindra Jadeja <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. Their combined contributions are considered a highly underrated aspect of the team's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.

## Key All-rounders: Hardik Pandya and Ravindra Jadeja

Hardik Pandya is regarded as the strongest sixth bowler among all teams in the World Cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. Similarly, Ravindra Jadeja is arguably the strongest fifth bowler, outside of South Africa's team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. The quality of both players individually is exceptional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.

In a match where Shardul Thakur bowled minimally, Jadeja and Pandya together delivered 15.5 overs, taking four wickets for 72 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. This highlights their ability to cover overs and take crucial wickets when needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. While Pandya might not always be fully fit or find the pitch suitable, and Jadeja might bowl seven or eight overs on some days, the combination of these two is invaluable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

## Strategic Team Balance

India's team selection, specifically concerning [[indias_bowling_strategy_and_selection_in_odis | India's bowling strategy and selection]], often prioritizes batting depth, leading to choices like including Shardul Thakur over Ravichandran Ashwin or [[role_of_mohammed_shami_in_indias_odi_strategy | Mohammed Shami]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. The team management prefers Shardul's batting in the number eight position for ODIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>.

The primary reason for this approach is to avoid a situation where batters feel constrained by a lack of depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>. Instead, the team wants batters to feel confident that there is ample batting support down the order, encouraging them to play more freely and take more risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>. This strategic decision about the batting card is considered more important than solely bolstering the bowling attack with an extra specialist bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>.

## Comparison with Other Teams

Most other teams in the World Cup would typically only possess one player of the calibre of Hardik Pandya or Ravindra Jadeja <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. While Bangladesh also has two strong [[role_of_allrounders_in_cricket_teams | all-rounders]] in Shakib Al Hasan and Mehidy Hasan Miraz, they are not quite at the same level as India's duo, and the rest of Bangladesh's team lacks similar strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

The ability to pick between players like [[role_of_mohammed_shami_in_indias_odi_strategy | Mohammed Shami]], Ashwin, and Shardul for the final spot, or having Ishan Kishan as a backup batter, demonstrates the incredible depth of the [[role_of_key_players_in_indias_cricket_team | Indian team]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. This depth, largely facilitated by their [[role_of_allrounders_in_cricket_teams | all-rounders]], makes it very difficult to identify a "floor" or weakness in the Indian squad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

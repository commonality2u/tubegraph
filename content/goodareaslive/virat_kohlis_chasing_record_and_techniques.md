[[Virat Kohli and his performance in ODI cricket | Virat Kohli]] has long been recognized for his exceptional ability in One Day International (ODI) chases, demonstrating a unique blend of skill, strategy, and resilience under pressure. His performance in chases often elevates him beyond many of his contemporaries.

## Chasing Statistics and Impact
[[Virat Kohli]]'s true strike rate in chases is a remarkable +8, which is considered absolutely fine for the role he plays in the first innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. His true average in chases stands at +17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>.

However, in the second innings, his true average significantly increases to +32, which is the mark of a truly great player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>. Coupled with this, his true strike rate also rises to +11, indicating an acceleration in his scoring rate when chasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>. This contrasts with players like Michael Bevan or MS Dhoni, who might slow down in chases, as Kohli and Chris Gayle do not slow down in the same way because their teams often haven't lost many wickets and are already ahead of the chase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.

### Comparison with Other Great Chasers
When looking at adjusted average and strike rate (referred to as "Zulu numbers"), [[Virat Kohli]]'s performance in chases stands out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>.
*   **Michael Bevan:** Adjusted average of 61.89, but notably slower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>.
*   **MS Dhoni:** Not particularly slow in chases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>.
*   **[[virat_kohlis_batting_strategy_and_records | Virat Kohli]]:** Adjusted average of 67.94 and adjusted strike rate of 96 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:36">[00:22:36]</a>. These numbers place him far ahead of the cluster of other great chasers, and not far removed from the records of [[ab_de_villiers_on_batting_technique_and_challenges | AB de Villiers]] and Viv Richards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>.

### Performance Under Pressure
Many of [[Virat Kohli]]'s innings in chases, especially against Pakistan, have occurred under the highest level of pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>. This includes performances in both ODI and [[techniques_and_strategies_in_t20_cricket_batting | T20 cricket]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. His record against Pakistan in ODIs is as strong as his record elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>.

## Batting Techniques in Chases
[[Virat Kohli]] is renowned for his world-class strike rotation and his ability to put consistent pressure on the opposition without solely relying on boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

### Strike Rotation
One of the key reasons for his effectiveness in chases is his ability to rotate the strike across multiple angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>.
*   **Singles:** He has around six different clear zones for singles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>. For example, with a good on-drive, he forces the long-on fielder back, and can still hit to the left of mid-on for a single if mid-on is up in the circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>. This allows him to always be ahead of the curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>.
*   **Twos:** [[Virat Kohli]] is exceptionally good at scoring twos, particularly in a specific zone where it is very hard for fielders to cover in a limited-overs game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>. Getting twos in this area, especially from straighter lines and lengths, significantly disrupts the fielding map for bowlers and challenges captains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>. A high percentage of his runs come from twos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>.

### Boundary Scoring
While he is a world-class strike rotator, he does not put pressure back on the game by hitting many sixes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. He scores 40% fewer sixes against pace and almost 50% fewer against spin than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. His fours scoring is generally at par against both pace and spin bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

## Performance Against Pace and Spin
His strike rate today was 123 against pace and 56 against spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:57">[00:27:57]</a>. This suggests a potential area of interest for opposition teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>.

While he is very good against Pakistan's pacers, specifically Shaheen Afridi and Haris Rauf, this might not translate to other attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>.
*   **Against Shaheen Afridi:** Outside of the very new ball, Shaheen generally doesn't possess weapons that cause [[Virat Kohli]] significant problems, as he doesn't generate the extra bounce across the batter like Mitchell Starc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>.
*   **Against Haris Rauf:** Haris Rauf bowls very fast into the pitch, which is something [[Virat Kohli]] loves, especially in white-ball [[cricket_strategies_and_player_techniques | cricket]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>. Haris Rauf does not bowl the full-length, outside-off-stump, wobble ball that troubles Kohli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>.

However, against pace attacks that utilize the attacking off-stump wobble ball, such as Nathan Smith, Matt Henry, Tim Southee, or Hazlewood and Cummins, [[Virat Kohli]] might face issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>.

## Current Form
[[Virat Kohli]]'s form has been consistently strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>. While there was a period in his innings where he was just knocking the ball around, he earns the right to do this, particularly in T20 cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>. He bought himself that time and then became the main attacker to finish the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:47">[00:27:47]</a>. This strategic accumulation before acceleration is a hallmark of his approach.

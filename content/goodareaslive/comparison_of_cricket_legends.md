## Player Matchups and Discussions

### Virat Kohli vs. Neil Harvey
*   [[virat_kohli | Virat Kohli]] was the unanimous choice to advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   Neil Harvey was highly regarded in "The Art of Batting" book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, despite having some "holes in his record" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   He had one of the greatest starts to a Test career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a> and was a brilliant left-hander against off-spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

### Victor Trumper vs. Sunil Gavaskar
*   [[sunil_gavaskar | Sunil Gavaskar]] was the unanimous choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   Victor Trumper is considered possibly the best wet-wicket player and one of the best attacking players of all time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   [[sunil_gavaskar | Sunil Gavaskar]] is on a "completely different level" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, recognized as one of the best players of spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a> and the first to score 10,000 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, averaging over 50 as an opener <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### Garfield Sobers vs. Ricky Ponting
*   Garfield Sobers advanced over Ricky Ponting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   Ricky Ponting was considered an "okay player" when young and "below average" when old, with his average holding up due to playing in a "great batting era" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. His main skill was his peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   Sobers had more weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>, more power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>, and "fewer flaws in his record" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, averaging more than Ponting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. He also had a significant bowling workload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, bowling more than Jimmy Anderson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. It's suggested he would have averaged even more if he had batted higher at three or four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Sobers also had one of the greatest peaks of all time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

### Don Bradman vs. Geoff Boycott
*   Don Bradman was the unanimous choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   Geoff Boycott is considered an "underestimated" and "fantastic player," though his personality overshadows his cricketing achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   When compared to [[sunil_gavaskar | Sunil Gavaskar]], it's stated that [[sunil_gavaskar | Sunil Gavaskar]] "has to be better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Both Boycott and [[sunil_gavaskar | Sunil Gavaskar]] are described as putting a "really high price on their wicket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

### Steve Smith vs. Mahela Jayawardene
*   [[steve_smith | Steve Smith]] was the unanimous pick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
*   Mahela Jayawardene's record against spin was surprisingly not as fantastic as perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>, though he is still one of the greatest players against spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. He had a "technical flaw" with his backlift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   On "watchability," Mahela is preferred over [[steve_smith | Steve Smith]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a> by some, while others enjoy [[steve_smith | Steve Smith]]'s "weirdness" and "flailing his bat around like a bird" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

### Clive Lloyd vs. Ken Barrington
*   Ken Barrington was chosen over Clive Lloyd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   Clive Lloyd is considered a "great player" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>, known for his dominance and hitting the ball hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. He often batted at number five <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a> and was a two-time World Cup winning captain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. He is also considered very underrated in ODI cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   Ken Barrington's record is described as "incredible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>, but his statistics are questioned due to playing against "fairly ordinary attacks" and not dominating in first-class cricket in England as much as other county players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:45">[00:29:45]</a>. He averaged 58 in Test cricket, with remarkable averages in Australia (69), India (96), New Zealand (73), Pakistan (76), and South Africa (101), but only 44 in the West Indies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>. He faced limited great bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a>.

### Javed Miandad vs. WG Grace
*   Javed Miandad advanced, eliminating WG Grace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>, which was an unexpected split vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:49">[00:32:49]</a>.
*   Most casual fans may not know WG Grace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. His ranking in "The Art of Batting" varied widely (8-37) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. He was a full-time doctor who still played cricket and averaged more than others in his era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>, even in his 30s and 40s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. It's speculated he would have averaged 55 if Test cricket existed for his prime 20s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. He didn't play many Test matches as he didn't view it as the ultimate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.
*   Javed Miandad never averaged below 50 in his Test career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>, played over 120 Tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>, and started very young (as a teenager) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. He is described as having a "mad genius vibe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. Both Miandad and Grace are called "super villains" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

### Younis Khan vs. Steve Waugh
*   Younis Khan won unanimously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.
*   [[steve_waugh | Steve Waugh]]'s career average is influenced by his high number of not-outs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. He preferred batting at number five <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a> and did not want to bat higher in the order when the Australian team needed him to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>, unlike Sobers who batted lower for team balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. He was very focused on maintaining a Test average of 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>, which some consider "stat padding" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.
*   Younis Khan has a strong case even without considering these factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>, and batted often at number three for Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

### Jack Hobbs vs. Greg Chappell
*   Jack Hobbs advanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.
*   Greg Chappell averaged 14 in every country he played in, and didn't play much in Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. He missed Test runs due to World Series Cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. He was described as a "combination of technical brilliance and also elegance" and a tall player during a period when there weren't many tall batters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.

### Allan Border vs. Len Hutton
*   Len Hutton was the unanimous choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.
*   Allan Border was a "great player," averaging 50 away from home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>, got hit in the head a lot, and played the West Indies at their peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>, considered a "warrior" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>.
*   Len Hutton is simply "better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>. His record is described as "almost impeccable" and "perfect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>. He broke the world record before WWII <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:14">[00:35:14]</a>, missed his 20s due to the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>, and lost an inch off his elbow but came back to dominate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:22">[00:35:22]</a>. He didn't make mistakes and played the right shot every time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:35:36]</a>. He averaged 55-56 in Test cricket and 55 in first-class cricket with 150 first-class hundreds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:10">[00:36:10]</a>. He played more Test matches than Don Bradman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:27">[00:36:27]</a>, and averaged highly in Australia (50), England (57), and the West Indies (77), only struggling against New Zealand (30) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:45">[00:36:45]</a>.

### Michael Clarke vs. George Headley
*   George Headley was the unanimous pick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.
*   [[michael_clarke | Michael Clarke]] had a "good run" to make it to this stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.
*   George Headley, often called the "Black Bradman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>, had an "insane" amount of runs in his first 19 Tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:49">[00:37:49]</a> and a higher batting average than [[viv_richards | Viv Richards]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:57">[00:37:57]</a>. He is considered one of the greatest players of all time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a>.

### VVS Laxman vs. Viv Richards
*   [[viv_richards | Viv Richards]] was the unanimous pick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>.
*   VVS Laxman had a "good run" to reach the second round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>. His overall record, especially on specific metrics, is "not very good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. He primarily batted at number five or six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>, but would have been a world-class number three or four in almost any other team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.

### Sachin Tendulkar vs. Kumar Sangakkara
*   [[sachin_tendulkar | Sachin Tendulkar]] was the unanimous pick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>.
*   [[kumar_sangakkara | Kumar Sangakkara]] is considered "Sri Lanka's best batter ever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a> and has a strong case for being a top 10 batter of all time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>.

### Brian Lara vs. Joe Root
*   Brian Lara was the unanimous choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>.
*   Brian Lara is the "first man in the history of the game to register a score of 400" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>.
*   Joe Root moved about five positions higher in the book while it was being written due to his continuous scoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:59">[00:21:59]</a>.

### AB de Villiers vs. Alastair Cook
*   AB de Villiers was the unanimous pick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a>.
*   AB de Villiers played an attacking style, averaged 50, played home cricket in South Africa, and was versatile with wicket-keeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>. He retired young <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>.
*   Alastair Cook was an opener in England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a> and also retired young <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>. He scored a century in his final Test match against India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:58">[00:23:58]</a> after facing calls for his removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>.

### Matthew Hayden vs. Jacques Kallis
*   Jacques Kallis was the unanimous choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>.
*   Matthew Hayden could change a game quicker than Kallis and had more "fear factor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>. He got dropped early in his career and came back in his prime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.
*   [[jacques_kallis | Jacques Kallis]] had a bowling workload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>. He is considered the "most underrated batter" and "most overrated bowler" of all time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>. He averaged around 55 in Test match batting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a> and is second in most centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>. He also scored a century in his last Test match, against India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>. He is considered the best Test batter from South Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.

### Sunil Gavaskar vs. Virat Kohli (Round of 16)
*   [[sunil_gavaskar | Sunil Gavaskar]] unanimously advanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>.
*   It is suggested that if [[virat_kohli | Virat Kohli]] had continued his career at a normal great player's trajectory, he would have come closer to [[sunil_gavaskar | Sunil Gavaskar]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.
*   [[sunil_gavaskar | Sunil Gavaskar]] remained good until the very end of his career, even in his last series against Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>.

### Garfield Sobers vs. Don Bradman
*   Don Bradman was the unanimous pick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>.
*   The early elimination of Sobers emphasizes the high standard of batters being discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>.

### Steve Smith vs. Ken Barrington
*   [[steve_smith | Steve Smith]] was the unanimous pick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>.

### Javed Miandad vs. Younis Khan
*   This was a split vote, with Miandad advancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:49">[00:32:49]</a>.
*   Miandad never dropped below a 50 average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:28">[00:32:28]</a> and played longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a> in a tougher bowling era compared to Younis Khan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:37">[00:33:37]</a>. Younis Khan batted brilliantly in the UAE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:56">[00:33:56]</a>.

### Jack Hobbs vs. Len Hutton
*   Jack Hobbs unanimously advanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a>.
*   Hutton and Hobbs are considered very close in the book's rankings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>. Hutton's career was impacted by WWII, but he still played more Tests than Bradman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:27">[00:36:27]</a>.
*   Hobbs had a remarkably long career of 20+ years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a>, with numbers similar to Bradman before WWI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:21">[00:49:21]</a>. He returned after WWI to dominate for another five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:29">[00:49:29]</a>, remaining competitive even in his 40s against rising stars like Bradman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:36">[00:49:36]</a>. He made 197 or 199 first-class hundreds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:16">[00:49:16]</a> and is possibly the person who "wanted to score runs more than anyone else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:57">[00:49:57]</a>.

### George Headley vs. Viv Richards
*   [[viv_richards | Viv Richards]] was the unanimous pick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>.
*   [[viv_richards | Viv Richards]] was considered "terrified" by teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a> and his ability to change a game "so violently" was unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:19">[00:46:19]</a>. He was almost better in England than elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:30">[00:46:30]</a> and arguably the best player against extreme pace of all time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:45">[00:46:45]</a>.

### Sachin Tendulkar vs. Brian Lara
*   [[sachin_tendulkar | Sachin Tendulkar]] was the unanimous pick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>. This is a classic [[comparison_of_historical_cricket_rivalries | rivalry]] that largely fueled online cricket discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:02">[00:39:02]</a>.
*   Brian Lara's peak was impacted by his focus on "sponsorships and nightlife" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>, but he could become great again "overnight" when focused on his legacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:11">[00:40:11]</a>. He is more capable of playing a "great innings tomorrow" than [[sachin_tendulkar | Sachin Tendulkar]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:33">[00:40:33]</a>. Lara "needed something to make him great" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:11">[00:41:11]</a> and at times found a level "even above [[sachin_tendulkar | Sachin Tendulkar]]'s" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>. Lara could "fail" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:02">[00:41:02]</a>.
*   [[sachin_tendulkar | Sachin Tendulkar]] was "great every single day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:20">[00:40:20]</a> and "didn't need anything to make him great" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:18">[00:41:18]</a>. He was remarkably consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>, considered the greatest teenage player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:46">[00:41:46]</a>, one of the greatest over 35 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:48">[00:41:48]</a>, and one of the greatest between 20 and 35 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>. He played on too long, denting his overall average, but still averaged over 40 everywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>. Brett Lee commented that [[sachin_tendulkar | Sachin Tendulkar]] would hit the ball in the same direction every time, while Lara could hit in different directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>.

### AB de Villiers vs. Jacques Kallis
*   [[jacques_kallis | Jacques Kallis]] was the unanimous pick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>.
*   It was suggested that AB de Villiers "could have been a better player than [[jacques_kallis | Kallis]], but he wasn't" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>. Both retired young, conveniently before the "pace playing pandemic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>.

### Don Bradman vs. Sunil Gavaskar (Quarterfinals)
*   Don Bradman was the unanimous choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>.
*   [[sunil_gavaskar | Sunil Gavaskar]] had a "really good run" reaching the quarterfinals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:26">[00:44:26]</a>, which is considered his "perfect" ranking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>.

### Steve Smith vs. Javed Miandad
*   [[steve_smith | Steve Smith]] was the unanimous pick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:09">[00:45:09]</a>.
*   Miandad had a "great run" and is considered not to deserve a semi-final spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:58">[00:44:58]</a>, possibly benefiting from an "easy bracket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:21">[00:45:21]</a>.
*   [[steve_smith | Steve Smith]]'s ranking changed while the book was being written, and he has recently shown a return to form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a>.

### Jack Hobbs vs. Viv Richards
*   Jack Hobbs was the unanimous pick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:38">[00:45:38]</a>.
*   [[viv_richards | Viv Richards]]'s "naked numbers" might not place him as high, but his strike rate and ability to terrify teams were significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>. He played on "a little too long" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08">[00:46:08]</a>.

*   [[sachin_tendulkar | Sachin Tendulkar]] was the unanimous pick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:41">[00:47:41]</a>.
*   [[jacques_kallis | Jacques Kallis]] was considered "lucky to make the quarterfinals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:49">[00:47:49]</a>, which is considered a fair assessment of his ranking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:53">[00:47:53]</a>.

## Grand Final: Don Bradman vs. Sachin Tendulkar

*   Don Bradman was the unanimous choice for the greatest batter of all time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:49">[00:50:49]</a>.
*   [[sachin_tendulkar | Sachin Tendulkar]]'s "tough luck" is that Bradman exists, with his average of 99.94 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:54">[00:50:54]</a>.
*   Bradman's case for number one is undeniable; he doesn't have a case for being number two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:21">[00:51:21]</a>.
*   While [[sachin_tendulkar | Sachin Tendulkar]] and Jack Hobbs have cases for number one, they could also be slipped down the rankings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>.
*   Bradman averaged 40 more than the next greatest batter of his era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a>, and his ability to average almost double what other great players did in their era is unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:06">[00:52:06]</a>.
*   He missed some of his peak years due to World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:06">[00:54:06]</a>, but averaged more after the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:23">[00:54:23]</a>.
*   Bradman is an "outlier" in sports history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:47">[00:52:47]</a>, comparable to figures like Wilt Chamberlain (though Bradman sustained his dominance longer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>, Jahangir Khan in squash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>, and Babe Ruth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:41">[00:53:41]</a>.
*   He is on a level "we will never see again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:33">[00:54:33]</a>. There was no comparable batter to him for over a century until [[sachin_tendulkar | Sachin Tendulkar]] emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:07">[00:55:07]</a>.
*   Bradman only played in England and Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:26">[00:55:26]</a>, but still averaged in the mid to high 80s against England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:38">[00:55:38]</a>, and more in England than Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:40">[00:55:40]</a>. He also dominated strong bowling lineups in Shield cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:44">[00:55:44]</a>.

## Conclusion: "The Art of Batting" Book
The book aims to showcase the variety and greatness of batters throughout cricket history, highlighting both well-known and often-forgotten players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:20">[00:56:20]</a>. The ranking process is subjective, with many variables and no single "correct" list, as even the researchers themselves don't fully agree on every position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:51">[00:57:51]</a>.

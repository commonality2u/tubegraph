From: [[goodareaslive]] <br/> 

The 26th episode of the CrickPiC podcast featured a draft competition to select the top five bowlers best suited to defend 10 runs in the final over of any cricket game, including T20s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This open-ended discussion allowed for both retired and current players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Top Picks

### Jasprit Bumrah
[[bowler_performances_and_strategies | Jasprit Bumrah]] was the unanimous first pick among the hosts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. He was described as the best defensive bowler ever seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>, with one host even stating that 10 runs might be "too many" for him to defend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. His recent performance in the IPL and a Test series against England further solidified his standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. He is one of the few white-ball seamers who batters tend to "block out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

### Lasith Malinga
[[bowler_performances_and_strategies | Lasith Malinga]] was the second pick, chosen for his versatility in [[attributes_of_successful_death_bowlers_in_cricket | death overs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. He could deliver slower balls, fast yorkers, and bouncers at will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Considered one of the most decorated names in the history of cricket for [[role_of_bowlers_in_winning_cricket_tournaments | bowling death overs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>, his peak performance was suggested to be even better than Bumrah's for a period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. His unique action and ability to get dip on his slower ones made him unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

### Wasim Akram
[[discussion_of_famous_odi_bowlers | Wasim Akram]] was selected for his incredible skill, especially at the death, whether bowling quick early in his career or with slower pace later on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. He was renowned for his ability to [[bowler_performances_and_strategies | reverse swing]] the old ball in [[attributes_of_successful_death_bowlers_in_cricket | death overs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>, making the ball "dance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. An anecdote highlighted his ability to defend small totals in exhibition games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>.

### Chaminda Vaas
[[discussion_of_famous_odi_bowlers | Chaminda Vaas]], another left-armer, was chosen for his numerous instances of successfully defending targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. A notable example was his defense of eight runs against Australia in the early 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. He was considered an underestimated bowler with skills like reverse swing and effective yorkers, becoming more skillful as he got older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

### Rashid Khan
[[role_of_bowlers_in_recent_t20_matches | Rashid Khan]] was the first spinner to be picked, recognized as a unique spinner who can bowl effectively in any phase of a T20 game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. As a captain, confidence would be high with him defending 10 runs in the final over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Batters find it extremely difficult to hit him for boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>, and he possesses a high chance of taking wickets, even with a wet ball, due to his speed through the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

### Glenn McGrath
[[discussion_of_famous_odi_bowlers | Glenn McGrath]] was selected for his nearly unplayable quality at the end of games for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. He is considered very similar to Bumrah in his style, and Australia's games often shifted in their favor when he bowled towards the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. His ODI economy rate in the last two overs was remarkably low at 3.74, across 82 innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:33">[00:42:33]</a>.

### Joel Garner
[[discussion_of_famous_odi_bowlers | Joel Garner]], also known as "The Big Bird," was picked for his ability to completely shut down games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. His performance in the World Cup final against England was cited as an example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. Garner's economy rate was described as "crazy," making it "impossible" to score off him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. He was one of the few seamers batters would "block out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>, often bowling within himself but capable of reaching "fifth gear" when needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

### Umar Gul
[[bowler_performances_and_strategies | Umar Gul]] was a strong candidate for his ability to bowl reverse-swinging yorkers at will, which were extremely difficult to defend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. In the early days of T20 cricket (late 2000s), he and Malinga were considered "platinum death over bowlers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. Besides his yorkers, he had good variations and change of pace, making him a potent wicket-taker who could derail innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.

### Dwayne Bravo
[[bowler_performances_and_strategies | Dwayne Bravo]] was noted for his ability to change things up and being difficult to hit for boundaries due to his change of pace and use of lengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. While sometimes considered overrated as a death bowler, he made his career around [[attributes_of_successful_death_bowlers_in_cricket | death bowling]] as an all-rounder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>. He is known for consistently delivering slower balls with significant "dip" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. He has bowled the last over of a chase 62 times with an economy rate of 8.4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>.

### Jess Jonassen
[[role_of_spinners_in_the_death_overs | Jess Jonassen]] was selected as a top spinner for her wicket-taking ability and economy in [[role_of_spinners_in_the_death_overs | death overs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>. She has bowled the second most balls ever by a woman at the death (last two overs) with an impressive bowling average of 12 and an economy of 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>. Her low arm action and ability to consistently bowl yorkers as a spinner are unique skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. Her competitiveness further enhances her effectiveness in crucial situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>.

### Saqlain Mushtaq
[[discussion_of_famous_odi_bowlers | Saqlain Mushtaq]] was a "hipster pick" from the 90s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>. He regularly bowled at the death for Pakistan in ODI cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>. His "doosra" was a mystery to batters, making it difficult to pick his variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. His ability as an off-spinner to turn the ball both ways made him a significant threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>.

### Sunil Narine
[[role_of_spinners_in_the_death_overs | Sunil Narine]] was highlighted for his exceptional ability to bowl for singles, making him adept at stopping scoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>. His ability to spin the ball both ways, combined with a knuckle ball, provides him with all necessary weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>. An analyst's observation noted that off-spinners like Narine often perform well at the death, with batters struggling to hit them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>.

### Curtly Ambrose
[[discussion_of_famous_odi_bowlers | Curtly Ambrose]] was compared to Joel Garner and Glenn McGrath, suggesting he was on a similar level as a [[role_of_bowlers_in_winning_cricket_tournaments | great death bowler]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>. Batters would find it extremely challenging to score off him at the end of innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:55">[00:27:55]</a>. His intimidating presence and "crazy eyes" added to the pressure on batters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>.

### Chris Jordan
[[bowler_performances_and_strategies | Chris Jordan]] was selected for his complete [[attributes_of_successful_death_bowlers_in_cricket | death bowling]] skill set, including deceptive pace, killer slow ones, and accurate yorkers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>. Despite sometimes being expensive, when he gets it right, he wins games by bowling at the death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">[00:30:15]</a>. His longevity and fitness were also noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. He has bowled the 20th over 23 times in T20 cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:24">[00:32:24]</a>, with an economy rate of 9.5 when bowling the last over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>.

### Mitchell Starc
[[bowler_performances_and_strategies | Mitchell Starc]] was chosen for his ability to be a massive wicket-taking threat and deliver under pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>. At his peak, he consistently delivered Yorkers, regardless of the format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>.

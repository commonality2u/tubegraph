[[Rohit Sharmas Test Career and Performance Analysis | Rohit Sharma]] has experienced fluctuating form, particularly in [[Rohit Sharmas IPL performance versus expectations | IPL cricket]], where his performance has been described as "more cold than hot for a while now" for Mumbai Indians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Transformation as India Captain
As captain of India in T20s and ODIs, [[Rohit Sharmas Test Career and Performance Analysis | Rohit Sharma]] made a conscious decision to adopt an aggressive batting approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. He aimed to "smash the ball" and lead by example in terms of attacking play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This strategic shift "completely changed their white ball cricket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, moving the team away from an "anchors" mentality towards a more "dominant" one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

When [[Rohit Sharmas Test Career and Performance Analysis | Rohit Sharma]] gains momentum, opposing teams often struggle, perceiving him as an "unstoppable force" capable of scoring a century off 30 balls and dramatically changing a game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Post-Captaincy Performance for Mumbai Indians
There is a noticeable difference in [[Rohit Sharmas Test Career and Performance Analysis | Rohit Sharma's]] [[Comparison of Rohit Sharmas roles for Mumbai Indians and India | batting strategy]] between playing for India and playing for Mumbai Indians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Despite Mumbai having a strong batting lineup, he often appears to adopt a more cautious approach, rather than smashing the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

Since relinquishing captaincy at Mumbai Indians, questions have arisen regarding [[Rohit Sharmas Test Career and Performance Analysis | Rohit Sharma's]] position within the team's "ecosystem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This transition can be "a very existential thing" for senior players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, as seen with [[Virat Kohli]] who underwent a period of "soulsearching" after stepping down or being removed from captaincy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This process of re-establishing one's role can "deeply affect form" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Senior players face the challenge of determining their place within the leadership group and the team's overall structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

It has been noted that [[Rohit Sharmas Test Career and Performance Analysis | Rohit Sharma]] has never achieved a strike rate over 150 in an IPL season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Given his aggressive style for India, it's believed he could achieve a strike rate of 160-165 in the IPL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. His best IPL batting numbers are reportedly achieved at number four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>, although he is expected to open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

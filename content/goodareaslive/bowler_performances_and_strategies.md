The second day of the match presented a dramatically different playing surface, significantly influencing [[bowling_strategies_and_pitch_analysis_in_test_cricket | bowler performances and strategies]] compared to the first day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The pitch transformed overnight from one of the greenest wickets seen to one of the flattest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, impacting how both teams approached their [[comparison_of_bowling_skills_and_strategies | bowling]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Pitch Conditions and Seam Movement

A key factor in the day's play was the extreme change in pitch conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The average score on day one at Perth was 12.76, while on day two it rose to 69.3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. This stark difference indicates a significant shift in the playing surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

Seam movement, a crucial element for fast bowlers, dramatically decreased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.
*   Yesterday, seam movement was around one degree for a good period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>, which historically leads to low batting averages (around 23-24 when over 0.6 degrees) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
*   Today, the median seam movement dropped significantly, being less than half in some overs (e.g., 0.04 degrees between overs 20 and 30 in the third innings compared to 0.86) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
*   This reduction in seam movement meant that batters were less likely to edge the ball into the cordon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>, making run-scoring easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

The curator's attempt to keep more moisture in the wicket to prevent cracking, coupled with Perth's intense heat, caused the surface to bake overnight, resulting in the drastic change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:10">[00:57:10]</a>.

## Individual Bowler Performances

### Jasprit Bumrah
*   **Performance:** Exhibited exceptional control, with 33% of his balls resulting in a false shot from the batter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>. This is considered a "ridiculous" statistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>.
*   **Strategy:** Understood immediately that a fuller length was more dangerous on this wicket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:04">[00:54:04]</a>.

### Harshit Rana
*   **Economy & False Shot Percentage:** While his economy rate was over three runs an over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>, his false shot percentage was high at 32%, close to Bumrah's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>. This indicates he is more of an old-fashioned "strike bowler" who aims to create mistakes rather than solely restrict runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>.
*   **Physicality & Development:** Possesses a good physical frame for a fast bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a> and bowled an incredibly long spell, showing good signs for future development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:24">[00:45:24]</a>.

### Pat Cummins
*   **Third Innings Average:** Historically, Cummins is much better in the final two innings, averaging 18 in the third innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.
*   **Match Performance:** Has not looked particularly good in this test, struggling to get sideways movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>. He has given width and overpitched at times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>.
*   **Captaincy:** As a "defensive-minded captain," he prefers to restrict scoring and was content with India's slow run rate, expecting conditions to turn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:16">[00:47:16]</a>. This patient approach did not work out as the pitch did not turn as expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:06">[00:51:06]</a>.

### Josh Hazlewood
*   **Seam & Accuracy:** Known to get more seam out of a surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. He is described as a "stock bowler" who consistently bowls line and length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:36">[00:48:36]</a>.
*   **Batting:** His batting, along with Mitchell Starc's, showcased how good the batting pitch was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

### Mitchell Starc
*   **Batting:** Showed high control, being out of control for only 20% of the time, even batting with the tail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   **Bowling:** Has specifically tried to get swing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. He hit a good length in the last innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:44">[00:54:44]</a>.

### Mohammed Siraj (SJ)
*   **Performance:** Swung a couple of balls and maintained a good economy rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>. He is encouraged to find his "Stuart Broad Zone" of not going for runs when not bowling at his best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:40">[00:39:40]</a>.

### Nathan Lyon
*   **Performance:** Has consistently struggled in the fourth innings but is "brilliant" in the first innings compared to other spinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. He is also considered a "stock bowler" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:50">[00:48:50]</a>.

### Marnus Labuschagne (Part-time Bowler)
*   **Bowling:** Bowled two spells of bouncers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. He was a leg spinner who has transitioned to bowling quicker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:57">[00:59:57]</a>. It is not uncommon for batters to be able to bowl at decent speeds, with control being the main challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>.

## Team Bowling Strategies

### [[Englands_bowling_performance_and_strategy | Australia's Bowling Strategy]]
*   **Patience:** Australia adopted an "incredibly patient" approach, waiting for mistakes rather than actively creating breakthroughs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Travis Head confirmed this patient approach, believing they were okay in the middle session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Proactivity:** They were criticised for not being proactive enough, especially in not bowling more bouncers to test batters like KL Rahul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. This might be due to concerns about a five-test series and managing bowler workload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.
*   **Killer Instinct Debate:** Despite winning multiple ICC tournaments recently, the Australian team is perceived by some as lacking the "Killer Instinct" of past sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:50">[00:46:50]</a>. This current team is more defensive-minded, with bowlers like Cummins and Hazlewood focusing on line and length rather than being aggressive strike bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:23">[00:48:23]</a>.
*   **Fielding:** There was a missed opportunity for a slip catch by Usman Khawaja due to his hands being in the wrong position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:36">[00:47:36]</a>.

### [[Indias_bowling_strategies_and_performance | India's Bowling Strategy]]
*   **Bowling to the Tail:** India has been the best team at bowling to the tail and finishing off an innings in the last three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>. This contradicts a common fan perception that India struggles against tail-enders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>. Their bowlers are doing well against the tail and are not getting the credit they deserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.

## Conclusion on [[comparison_of_bowling_strategies_and_patterns | Bowling Strategies]]
Both teams exhibited a patient approach, with Australia hoping for mistakes and India capitalising on the changed pitch conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>. The extreme change in pitch conditions was highly unusual for a test match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>, making strategic predictions difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:06">[01:05:06]</a>.

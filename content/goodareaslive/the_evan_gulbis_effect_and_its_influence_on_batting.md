The "Evan Gulbis effect" describes the psychological impact on batters when they lack perceived batting depth or security lower down the order, specifically around the number seven or eight positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>. This effect causes batters to play more conservatively, slowing down their scoring rate, even if they have the capability to score quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>. It's a "very real thing" that is difficult to quantify but significantly influences strategic decisions in cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>.

## Origin of the Concept

The term "Evan Gulbis effect" is named after Australian cricketer Evan Gulbis, a "bits and pieces cricketer" who was handy with the bat, ball, and in the field, though not exceptional in any single area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>. His unique skill set allowed him to play professionally, particularly in the Big Bash League <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>.

The concept solidified during the 2018-2019 Big Bash semi-final and final involving the Melbourne Stars, Gulbis's team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>. In the semi-final, Gulbis was listed at number eight but neither batted nor bowled, leading the Stars to drop him for the final, believing his role could be covered by other players like Jackson Bird (bowling) and Adam Zampa (batting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.

Despite seemingly covering all bases, the Melbourne Stars lost the final <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>. The key insight was that openers Ben Dunk and Marcus Stoinis played too slowly, scoring at lower-than-usual strike rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>. They felt the pressure because they looked at the scoreboard and the lineup, realizing there was "no batting after number five" and that if they got out, the team had "no batting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>. This forced them to play a more defensive, survival-oriented game, ultimately leading to their defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>.

### Key Learnings:
*   Analysts initially underestimated the importance of the number seven and eight batting positions, as they face few balls on average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>.
*   Working with teams directly revealed that batters consciously make decisions based on the batting order and potential later scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>.
*   Not all batters are equally affected; aggressive players like Glenn Maxwell do not worry about what happens after their dismissal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>.

## Influence on Batting in the Cricket World Cup Final

The Evan Gulbis effect played a significant role in India's loss in the World Cup final against Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

### India's Defensive Mindset
India's decision to have Mohammed Shami bat at number eight in the final was a manifestation of succumbing to the Evan Gulbis effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. Despite India's typical aggressive approach throughout the tournament, they reverted to a defensive mindset in the knockout game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:56">[00:48:56]</a>.

#### Virat Kohli and KL Rahul's Partnership
Australia's strategy specifically aimed to keep [[strategic_insights_on_test_cricket_batting | Virat Kohli]] and [[strategic_insights_on_test_cricket_batting | KL Rahul]] at the crease early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>. This was a direct tactical battle won by Australia, knowing that both players have a history of slowing down when they perceive a lack of batting depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>.

*   **Virat Kohli**: He had openly admitted to going slower in an innings against South Africa earlier in the tournament because he "did not have enough faith in the lower order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>. He scores slower when Shardul Thakur is not playing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>.
*   **KL Rahul**: He has stated in past IPL seasons that not having enough security in the batting order limits his ability to "explode later" in an innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>. His innings of 66 runs off 107 deliveries in the final was "painstakingly slow," reflecting the Evan Gulbis effect in full flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:15">[00:32:15]</a>. Rahul, despite having "five gears" in his batting, down-shifted to a survival mindset, making it difficult to shift back and put pressure on the bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>.

This defensive approach, exemplified by their slow scoring and lack of boundary hitting, meant that Australia faced "no pressure" and could easily implement their bowling changes and field settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>.

#### Ravindra Jadeja's Promotion
Another defensive move by India was promoting Ravindra Jadeja above Suryakumar Yadav in the batting order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:53">[00:43:53]</a>. India's lack of trust in Suryakumar Yadav under pressure, despite his explosive abilities, led them to send Jadeja, who is not comfortable attacking spin in the middle overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:12">[00:44:12]</a>.

> "Rohit did everything he could to change this team's mindset, and when it came down to it, they went defensive, and that Jadeja promotion is a big part of that." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:48">[00:44:48]</a>

Jadeja's slow innings (9 runs off 22 balls) further "sucked up all of the momentum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:36">[00:47:36]</a>, preventing any pressure from being put back on Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:07">[00:48:07]</a>. This was India's only batting lineup change in the tournament, and it was a defensive one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>.

## Distinguishing from "Choking"

While the popular narrative often labels India's loss as "choking," the Evan Gulbis effect highlights a deeper, more nuanced issue of a "defensive mindset" in knockout games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:45">[00:33:45]</a>. It's not merely a failure under pressure but a strategic and psychological reversion to cautious play that prevents a team from playing to its full potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>.

> "It's too easy to say they choked. It's much better to say they made a series of bad decisions and that Australia played an absolute blinder of a game there." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:44">[00:47:44]</a>

This defensive approach, combined with Australia's superior reading of conditions and tactical decisions, created a "confluence of so many different things" that led to India's defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

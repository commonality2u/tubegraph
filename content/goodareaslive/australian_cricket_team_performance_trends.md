[[australian_cricket_teams_current_struggles | Australia]] recently suffered a significant defeat, losing a Test match by 295 runs to India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This marked the first time since 2016 that [[australian_cricket_teams_current_struggles | Australia]] has lost consecutive home Tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The team faces challenges with more players needing to be dropped than available replacements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Batting Performance

[[batting_performance_analysis_of_india_and_australia | Australia's batting performance]] has been a major concern, particularly at the top of the order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

### Top Order Struggles
The [[australian_cricket_teams_current_struggles | Australian]] top four has averaged 28.9 runs this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. This is their worst calendar year average since 1964, a significant drop from previous dominant years where they averaged in the mid-40s (e.g., 48, 45, 43) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. Historically low years for the top four include 1996 (25 average) and 1984 (low average), periods when the team was struggling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. The 2018 season, when they lost key players like Bancroft, Smith, and Warner, also saw a dip to 29.43 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

Individual concerns include:
*   **Steve Smith**: Despite less worry about him generally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>, he struggles on pitches with inconsistent bounce, explaining his low scores in fourth innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.
*   **Usman Khawaja**: Appears to be entering another periodic dip in form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
*   **Marnus Labuschagne**: Currently struggling to assert himself at the wicket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
*   **Fourth Innings Performance**: Many [[australian_cricket_teams_current_struggles | Australian]] batters, including Smith, Labuschagne, and Khawaja, struggle to make runs in the fourth innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. In contrast, Alex Carey and Travis Head have performed well in this scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

### Batting Against Pace
Since 2022, [[australian_cricket_teams_current_struggles | Australia]] ranks poorly in batting averages against high-end pace (140 km/h+), comparable to South Africa and Bangladesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. This is a concerning trend given their historical strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

### Middle Order Reliance
Despite top-order issues, [[australian_cricket_teams_current_struggles | Australia]] may still win series through their bowling attack and middle order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. Travis Head, a key middle-order player, averages 50 in Tests at home, showcasing his strength in familiar conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

## Bowling Performance

### Kookaburra Ball Impact
The Kookaburra ball has undergone changes, leading to a significant increase in seam movement in [[australian_cricket_teams_current_struggles | Australia]] since the 2014-2015 season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. This change has made [[cricket_and_player_performances | playing cricket]] in [[australian_cricket_teams_current_struggles | Australia]] very different, requiring a blend of old-fashioned and new [[cricket_and_player_performances | cricket]] techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.

### Collapses
[[australian_cricket_teams_current_struggles | Australia]] has suffered multiple batting collapses in their last seven Test matches, including scores like 4 for 16, 5 for 54, and 5 for 79 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

### Individual Bowlers
Mitchell Starc has shown better form recently, particularly in pink-ball games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:53">[00:41:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:57">[00:41:57]</a>. Josh Hazlewood has also been effective, with India struggling to score runs off him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>.

## Home Test Record
Since 2000, [[australian_cricket_teams_current_struggles | Australia]] has experienced double losses at home multiple times:
*   2016 (vs. South Africa) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>
*   2010-2011 (vs. England in Melbourne and Sydney) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>
*   2008 (vs. South Africa) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>

The recent loss to West Indies and India marks six Test losses at home since 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.

### Day-Night Tests
Historically, [[australian_cricket_teams_current_struggles | Australia]] has been very consistent in day-night Tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>. However, their most recent day-night Test resulted in a loss to the West Indies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>. Pink ball Tests tend to have lower averages across sessions, with the first and last sessions averaging around 24 runs per wicket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. This indicates that even stronger teams may find it challenging in these conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>.

## Future Outlook and Challenges
[[australian_cricket_teams_current_struggles | Australia]] faces potential challenges with key players nearing retirement, including Usman Khawaja, Steve Smith, Mitchell Starc, and Nathan Lyon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:29">[00:37:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:02">[00:38:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:04">[00:38:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:05">[00:38:05]</a>. The team lacks immediate, high-quality replacements for all positions, especially in the top order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:54">[00:39:54]</a>.

The domestic Shield [[cricket_and_player_performances | cricket]] has seen difficult conditions for batters in the last four years, with reinforced Kookaburra balls and result-oriented pitches making run-scoring challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:35">[00:50:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:50:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:43">[00:50:43]</a>. This environment means that while there are many bowlers, top-tier batting talent is not developing as quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>.

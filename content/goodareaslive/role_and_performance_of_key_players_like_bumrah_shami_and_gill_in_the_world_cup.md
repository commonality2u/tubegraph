India showcased a brutal and thorough performance in a recent World Cup match against Sri Lanka in Mumbai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. The match saw India using the first innings as a practice game for their batters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>, scoring a formidable 350-odd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. Following this, the Indian bowlers delivered an absolutely brutal performance, with wickets falling rapidly for Sri Lanka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.

## Jasprit Bumrah's Impact

[[Performance and impact of key players in the World Cup final | Jasprit Bumrah]] immediately made an impact, taking a wicket with his first ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>. His opening delivery was described as "ridiculous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

### Technical Analysis of Bumrah's Bowling
Bumrah's unique bowling action, where he "falls away a little bit," creates unusual advantages despite its peculiarities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.
*   **Angle and Movement**: He releases the ball from remarkably wide, outside the wide line, an area more typical for a left-arm bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. From this angle, the ball should logically head down the leg side, but it straightens to hit the off stump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>.
*   **"Held Up" Delivery**: The ball's movement was so significant it "darts back so much" at high speed, akin to a left-arm finger spinner like Ravindra Jadeja or Axar Patel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>.
*   **First Ball Surprise**: Even Bumrah himself would likely have been surprised by the extent of the ball's movement on the first delivery, which was pitched just on off-stump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>.

This delivery was highlighted as the speaker's favourite ball of the match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>.

## Mohammed Shami's Performance

[[Role of Mohammed Shami in Indias ODI strategy | Mohammed Shami]] also took a wicket with his first ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a> and was on a hat-trick at one point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.

### Bowling Style and Impact
[[Role of bowlers in recent T20 matches | Shami's bowling]] style is described as more "traditional" compared to other bowlers like Mohammed Siraj or Bumrah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:29:00">[15:29:00]</a>. His arm is "absolutely dead straight" and "doesn't create any angle," distinguishing him from bowlers who rely on wider angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:33:00">[15:33:00]</a>.

*   **Pressure-Induced Wickets**: Shami's wickets, particularly the one against Asalanka, benefited from the mounting pressure on the opposition, leading to what was termed a "collapse wicket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>. His delivery to Asalanka was a wide, full ball that the batter simply forced straight to the fielder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:27:00">[14:27:00]</a>.
*   **Consistent Seam Movement**: Shami consistently keeps the seam up, and his deliveries often dart back off the seam, even when bowled full, a quality that is challenging to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:35:00">[18:35:35]</a>.
*   **Overall Effectiveness**: Despite being described as the "least exciting player" among the Indian bowlers on the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:15:00">[17:15:00]</a>, Shami ended up with a significant number of wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:33:00">[18:33:00]</a>.

## Shubman Gill's Batting Contribution

[[Role of key players in Indias cricket team | Shubman Gill]]'s performance was highlighted as outstanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:16:00">[28:16:00]</a>.

### Batting Style and ODI Records
Gill, who was the number two ranked ODI batter coming into the tournament and had one of the highest batting averages in ODI history (depending on minimum runs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:47:00">[27:47:00]</a>, missed the first couple of games due to Dengue fever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:58:00">[27:58:00]</a>. This match allowed him to get runs and demonstrate his skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.
*   **Touch and Placement**: Gill's batting features a notable "touch on a shot," even against quick bowlers, and an ability to put away bad balls, including those slightly offline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:22:00">[28:22:00]</a>.
*   **Wristwork**: His wristwork allows him to hit the ball into gaps, demonstrating awareness of fielders like short fine leg and sweep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:10:00">[29:10:00]</a>.
*   **Power**: He also possesses significant power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:21:00">[29:21:00]</a>.

## Overall Indian Team Dynamics

### Bowling Dominance
The Indian pace attack, featuring Bumrah, Shami, and Mohammed Siraj, was described as one of the best seen at a World Cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:06:00">[42:06:00]</a>. They have demonstrated an unprecedented strike rate, surpassing even Australia's 2015 team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:24:00">[42:24:00]</a>. Siraj also contributed with two early wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.
*   **Powerplay Prowess**: Siraj, in particular, has an exceptional record against Sri Lanka in the powerplay, averaging 5.3 runs per wicket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:16:00">[21:16:00]</a>.

### Batting Lineup Strength
India boasts a "ridiculous" top-order batting lineup, with players like Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul, and Shubman Gill all averaging over 45 in ODIs (minimum 2000 runs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:34:00">[29:34:00]</a>. This level of consistent high averages is "absolutely incredible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:21:00">[30:21:00]</a>.

### Fielding Efficiency
India's catch efficiency in the tournament is at 81% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:44:00">[36:44:00]</a>, a strong figure well within acceptable margins for white-ball cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:47:00">[36:47:00]</a>. However, it's noted that India has created fewer chances (31) compared to teams like South Africa (63) or New Zealand (56), suggesting a different bowling approach that targets stumps more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:12:00">[37:12:00]</a>.

## Sri Lanka's Struggles and Key Player Context

Sri Lanka's performance was characterized by an early collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. Their captain, Dasun Shanaka, won the toss and decided to call it a day soon after <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.

### Madushanka's Performance
Dilshan Madushanka was highlighted as perhaps the only positive for Sri Lanka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:06:00">[33:06:00]</a>. He was the leading wicket-taker in the tournament with 18 wickets at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:39:00">[33:39:00]</a>. While his economy rate of 6.4 was not great <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:07:00">[34:07:00]</a>, he showed development during the tournament, particularly excelling in the powerplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:59:00">[33:59:00]</a>. His slow ball was also noted as a good development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:52:00">[34:52:00]</a>.

### Injury and Player Fitness Concerns
The absence of Wanindu Hasaranga was felt by Sri Lanka, as he is considered their main strike bowler, a role that [[performance_of_specific_players_in_t20_world_cup_2024 | Maheesh Theekshana]] (whose bowling average ballooned to over 100 in the tournament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:01:00">[32:01:00]</a>) could not fill defensively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:51:00">[45:51:00]</a>. There were also questions about the overall conditioning of Sri Lankan players due to recurrent injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:53:00">[49:53:00]</a>.

The presence of dew (or the "dew factor") is often considered a significant influence on match outcomes in cricket, particularly in T20s. Teams frequently cite it as a reason for their decision-making at the toss.

## Impact on Toss Decisions
The [[role_of_conditions_and_toss_in_cricket_outcomes | dew factor]] is commonly perceived to encourage teams to opt for chasing a total rather than batting first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. This strategy is based on the idea that a wet, dewy ball becomes harder for bowlers to grip and control, making it easier for the batting team to score runs in the second innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:21:00">[27:21:00]</a>.

## Statistical Disconnect
Despite the widespread belief among teams and fans that dew is a major factor, the statistical evidence suggests a smaller impact than commonly assumed.

*   From 2015 onwards in T20s, there has been a minor advantage for chasing teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.
*   If dew were as significant an obstacle as thought, the win percentage for teams batting first would likely be lower than 47% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>.
*   One analyst noted that if dew played a major factor, the statistics would show a more significant advantage for chasing teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>.
*   The general perception that dew is a "huge factor" might be overstated, as the current statistics (53% win rate for chasing vs. 47% for batting first) do not strongly support this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:25:00">[15:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:58:00">[29:58:00]</a>.

### Unpredictability of Dew
The timing of dew's arrival can be unpredictable. Sometimes, dew may even come in during the first innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>, affecting teams bowling at the death in that innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>. This unpredictability means that a decision made based solely on the potential for dew might not always be accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50:00">[15:50:00]</a>.

## Ground-Specific Considerations
While the overall impact of dew might be less than perceived, there are likely a few key grounds globally where dew consistently presents a significant factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:34:00">[15:34:00]</a>. This emphasizes the importance of understanding specific [[the_role_of_pitch_conditions_in_cricket_outcomes | pitch conditions]] and local forecasts rather than relying on a blanket strategy. For instance, in a day game with spin-friendly and slow conditions, one analyst expressed a strong preference for batting first, indicating that the dew factor would need substantial data to outweigh these conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:51:00">[22:51:00]</a>.

## Broader Implications
The strong emphasis on the dew factor leads to teams prioritizing chasing, which might prevent them from developing their skills in batting first. This can be detrimental, especially in crucial matches like World Cups, where winning the toss is not guaranteed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a>.

Ultimately, there is a question of whether cricket truly has a "dew problem" given the statistics, and if resources like super soppers are being overused based on an exaggerated perception of dew's influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:58:00">[29:58:00]</a>.

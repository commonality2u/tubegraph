Pakistan's batting performance in the tournament has been characterized by slow starts and anemic totals, resembling "trying to watch a seven-year-old push a full-size bus up a hill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a> or a cat too lazy to chase a bird a meter away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Their top order, currently depleted, has struggled, batting like "people running in waist-high water" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a> and losing wickets when attempting to attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Slow Scoring and Inability to Accelerate

Pakistan's scoring rates have been notably low from the outset in the tournament:
*   **Overs 1-20:** Against New Zealand, they scored 66 runs, and against India, 79 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. These starts are among the slowest in the tournament, comparable only to matches like Afghanistan versus South Africa or Bangladesh versus India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Overs 11-25:** This period is identified as a "separate problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Historically, Pakistan scored around five runs an over in this phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>, but this rate has significantly dropped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. They are in the company of teams like Afghanistan (who purposely start slow) and Bangladesh (who have no top order to speak of) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Even slower-scoring teams like New Zealand and South Africa are still much quicker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

## Key Player Performance Issues

### Muhammad Rizwan
Muhammad Rizwan's strike rate shows a problematic pattern:
*   **Initial Phase:** He started well, scoring six runs off 10 balls, but then "completely dried up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **Two-Paced Batter:** Rizwan is described as a "two-paced batter" with gears that are either too slow ("third gear") or too fast ("fifth-sixth gear") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. When stuck in third gear, Pakistan falls behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   **Boundary Hitting:** He is not a "particularly good boundary scorer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
    *   He scores "40% less sixes than expected" against pace and "almost 50% less against spin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>.
    *   He scores only "par amount of fours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.
*   **Strike Rotation:** While a "world-class strike rotator," he fails to put pressure back on the opposition due to his inability to hit sixes and insufficient fours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. This means he "can't catch up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.
*   **Consistency:** This issue is not new, but a "problem with the pattern" of his innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. On the day of analysis, his strike rate against pace was 42, significantly lower than his normal 92 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

### Babar Azam
Babar Azam is seen as having a similar issue to Rizwan, with both players having comparable batting patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. If both are in elite form and averaging 55-60, "a bunch of sluggers" could bat around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>, but when one goes out early (as Babar did) and the other gets stuck (Rizwan), it severely impacts the team's ability to set competitive totals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

## Strategic and Compositional Problems

*   **Lack of Middle/Lower Order:** Pakistan "don't really have a middle order or a lower order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>, making Rizwan's ability to bat through the innings crucial.
*   **Overlap of Player Types:** They have a surplus of players who perform a similar role, like Imam-ul-Haq (average 47, strike rate 82), Babar, and Rizwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>. Shan Masood also averages around 50 in List A cricket, creating "four guys who do a similar job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:24">[01:00:24]</a>.
*   **Missing Aggressive Batters:** Pakistan lacks a player who can average 30-35 runs at a strike rate of 105-110 in the lower order, like a Heinrich Klaasen or David Miller type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:32">[01:00:32]</a>.
    *   Khushdil Shah, with an average of 32 and a strike rate of 98 in 15 ODIs, might be that player, but it's not consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:04">[01:02:04]</a>.
    *   Iftikhar, with an average of 41 and a strike rate of 112, performed well later in his career but may not be the same player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:26">[01:05:26]</a>.
*   **No "Extra Gear":** Even when Pakistan's players get set, it's "very hard for them to hit themselves out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:02">[01:07:02]</a> of a slow scoring rate, unlike players like Rassie van der Dussen or Steve Smith who can innovate and hit sixes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:05">[01:07:05]</a>.
*   **Impact of Injuries/Absences:** The team is currently missing their two first-choice openers, which means their batting lineup is not at full strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:47">[00:36:47]</a>.

> [!info] Pakistan's Batting Challenges Summarized
> Pakistan's batting is characterized by a "very big hole" in terms of power-hitting and variability, leading to a "one-paced" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>. They continue to produce similar types of batters, resulting in "so many holes in this lineup" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:20">[01:02:20]</a>.

## Comparison to Other Teams

*   **India:** India's batting lineup is described as "very good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>, with players like Shubman Gill, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, and Shreyas Iyer firing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. They have significant depth, with players like Yashasvi Jaiswal, Sanju Samson, or Abishek Sharma as backups for openers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:43">[00:59:43]</a>.
*   **South Africa:** While South Africa needs to strengthen their top order against good attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:54">[00:33:54]</a>, they have anchor players like Aiden Markram and Rassie van der Dussen who can catch up, along with power hitters like Heinrich Klaasen and David Miller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:49">[00:45:49]</a>. Pakistan cannot replicate this strategy because their anchor-type batters cannot accelerate in the same way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:49">[00:45:49]</a>.
*   **Australia:** Even Australia, undergoing changes, has variability with players like Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Mitchell Marsh, Marnus Labuschagne, and Travis Head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:41">[01:02:41]</a>.

## Impact on Game Outcomes

The slow scoring and lack of acceleration mean that even on a pitch where 280 would have been a "very interesting chase" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>, Pakistan's total of 245-250 meant their only chance of winning was to take "three quick wickets in the power play" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. Muhammad Rizwan, in particular, has "left runs on the table" by not scoring quicker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

The overall assessment is that Pakistan's team "makes more sense on paper than it does in real life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:56">[00:41:56]</a> due to these recurring batting issues.

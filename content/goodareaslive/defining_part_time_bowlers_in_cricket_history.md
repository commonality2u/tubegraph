From: [[goodareaslive]] <br/> 

Defining a "part-time bowler" in cricket has historically been a challenging and subjective task, often leading to extensive debate among fans and analysts alike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. Unlike specialist bowlers or [[the_subjectivity_in_classifying_part_time_versus_allrounder_bowlers | all-rounders]], the criteria for what constitutes a "part-timer" remains fluid, influencing how players' contributions are perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:39">[03:37:39]</a>.

## The Subjectivity of Classification

The difficulty in classifying part-time bowlers stems from the lack of a clear, objective definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. Attempts to quantify it, such as averaging more than five overs per game in One Day International (ODI) cricket, sometimes include players not typically considered [[the_subjectivity_in_classifying_part_time_versus_allrounder_bowlers | all-rounders]], like Darren Lehmann and Viv Richards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. Cricket analysts and forums have grappled with the distinction between a part-time and an occasional bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.

Players like Steve Waugh present a particular challenge; while his bowling numbers might appear part-time, his initial selection for the team was due to his bowling ability before a hamstring injury affected his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. Similarly, Hansie Cronje, despite having all-rounder capabilities, often functioned as a sixth bowler in a South African team rich with other all-rounders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. This highlights that a player's role can be influenced by team composition rather than just individual skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.

## Notable Part-Time Bowlers

### [[notable_part_time_bowlers_like_sachin_tendulkar_and_carl_hooper | Sachin Tendulkar]]
[[notable_part_time_bowlers_like_sachin_tendulkar_and_carl_hooper | Sachin Tendulkar]] is often considered a handy part-time bowler, capable of picking up wickets, particularly in ODI cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.
His career statistics include:
*   46 wickets in Test cricket at an average of 54 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>.
*   154 wickets in ODI cricket at an average of 44 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.
*   His ODI economy rate was 5.1, considered quite low for his era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>.
*   He also took one wicket in his solitary T20 International appearance, with an average of 12 and an economy of 4.8 from 15 deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>.

Despite a seemingly poor Test record, his ability to provide partnership-breaking spells, often mixing medium pace, off-spin, and leg-spin, made him a valuable option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>. He was more available to bowl over a long period compared to some others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>, though his bowling usage decreased later in his career with the emergence of other spin options like Virender Sehwag and Suresh Raina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.

### Michael Bevan
Michael Bevan is a "fascinating" case due to his bowling record, especially in Test cricket, where he took 29 wickets in 18 matches at an average of 24, including a 10-wicket haul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>. This is despite the fact that he "did not want to bowl" and "actively was fighting the urge to bowl" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>. In contrast, in 232 ODIs, he only took 36 wickets at an average of 46 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a>. He bowled left-arm leg-spin incredibly fast, making it hard for batters to face, though his control could be inconsistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>. His career exemplifies a part-timer who performed well despite his disinterest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>.

### [[notable_part_time_bowlers_like_sachin_tendulkar_and_carl_hooper | Carl Hooper]]
[[notable_part_time_bowlers_like_sachin_tendulkar_and_carl_hooper | Carl Hooper]] is considered a part-timer "in spirit" due to his perceived lack of commitment to the craft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>. His record includes:
*   114 wickets in 102 Test matches at an average of 49.42 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>.
*   193 wickets in 227 ODIs at an average of 36.05, with an economy of 4.36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>.
*   He even had a "bunny situation" with Allan Border, dismissing him seven times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:00]</a>.

Despite his significant number of wickets, particularly in ODIs where he sometimes functioned as a fifth bowler, his bowling action often suggested disinterest, similar to Chris Gayle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:00">[12:23:00]</a>. His high Test bowling average of 49 further supports his classification as a part-timer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>.

### Mohammad Hafeez
Mohammad Hafeez's classification as a part-timer is debatable, with some considering him a "high performing all-rounder" due to his significant wicket tally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:07:00">[15:07:00]</a>. His statistics include:
*   53 wickets in 55 Test matches at an average of 35 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:25:00">[14:25:00]</a>.
*   139 wickets in 218 ODIs at an average of 28.84 and an economy of 4.18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a>.
*   61 wickets in 119 T20Is at an average of 22.75 and an economy of 6.6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:39:00">[14:39:00]</a>.

He often served as the third spinner alongside Saeed Ajmal and Shahid Afridi, a period where his bowling usage was high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:46:00">[14:46:00]</a>. However, outside this phase, he bowled less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:51:00">[14:51:00]</a>. While he was particularly effective against left-handed batters, his overall inclusion was often as an all-rounder, blurring the lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:47:00">[15:47:00]</a>.

### Doug Walters
Doug Walters, a "blast from the past", is renowned for his remarkable part-time bowling record in Test cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:14:00">[18:14:00]</a>.
*   49 wickets in 74 Test matches at an average of 29 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:20:00">[18:20:00]</a>.
*   He bowled in 72 Test innings, but only 10 out of 28 ODI innings, indicating infrequent usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:07:00">[20:07:00]</a>.
*   In first-class cricket, he took 190 wickets in 258 games with an average of 35 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:49:00">[18:49:00]</a>.

Stories suggest he would take a wicket and then not want to continue bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:40:00">[18:40:00]</a>. Despite bowling a "half-trucker outside off stump" and being perceived as lucky, his impressive average of 29 makes him one of the most important part-time bowlers of all time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:29:00">[19:29:00]</a>.

### Michael Clarke
Michael Clarke, an Australian left-arm finger spinner, is another prominent part-timer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:40:00">[21:40:00]</a>.
*   31 wickets in 115 Tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:45:00">[21:45:00]</a>.
*   57 wickets in 245 ODIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:50:00">[21:50:00]</a>.
*   Only 6 wickets in 34 T20Is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:52:00">[21:52:00]</a>.

He bowled in approximately half of his games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:57:00">[21:57:00]</a>. His most memorable bowling performances include a 6 for 9 against India, which significantly impacted Test matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:09:00">[22:09:00]</a>. While remembered for more bowling than he actually did, injuries like his back issues limited his long-term usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:33:00">[22:33:00]</a>. His deliveries had a good loop, resembling Joe Denly's in deception, making him effective against unfamiliar batters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:10:00">[23:10:00]</a>.

### Aravinda de Silva
Aravinda de Silva is considered a "part-time Sri Lankan bowler" who excelled at picking up wickets when given the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:40:00">[25:40:00]</a>.
*   29 wickets in 58 Test innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:07:00">[26:07:00]</a>.
*   106 wickets in 156 ODI innings, averaging 41 and 39 respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:12:00">[26:12:00]</a>.
*   He took a couple of four-wicket hauls in ODIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:17:00">[26:17:00]</a>.

His performances, particularly during the 1996 World Cup, perhaps overinflated the perception of his bowling prowess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:45:00">[26:45:00]</a>. However, he provided an additional spin option crucial in conditions favoring spinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:26:00">[26:26:00]</a>.

### Simon Katich
Simon Katich is highlighted as an "elite level part-timer" due to his impressive record despite his dislike for bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:21:00">[29:21:00]</a>.
*   21 wickets in 25 Test innings (across 56 matches) at an average of 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:54:00">[27:54:00]</a>.
*   His strike rate was a wicket every 49 balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:59:00">[27:59:00]</a>.
*   Notably, he never bowled in any of his ODIs or T20 Internationals, only bowling 18 balls in 118 T20 games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:03:00">[28:03:00]</a>.

Stories abound of team management having to "drag him to the crease" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:25:00">[28:25:00]</a>. His first-class record of 107 wickets in 266 games at 35 further shows his ability despite his apparent disinterest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:08:00">[29:08:00]</a>.

### Nathan Astle
Nathan Astle is recognized as an iconic "military medium part-timer" from New Zealand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:32:00">[30:32:00]</a>.
*   51 wickets in 81 Test matches at 42 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:02:00">[30:02:00]</a>.
*   99 wickets in 223 ODIs at 38.47, with an economy rate of 4.7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:06:00">[30:06:00]</a>.
*   A peculiar record of 4 wickets in 4 T20Is at an average of 12.5 and an economy of 7.31 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:15:00">[30:15:00]</a>.

He is often compared to Craig McMillan in discussions of quintessential part-time bowlers, with McMillan perhaps seen as more "fun" due to his erratic style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:51:00">[31:51:00]</a>.

### Chris Gayle
Christopher Henry Gayle, despite being primarily known for his batting, also falls into the part-timer category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:19:00">[33:19:00]</a>.
*   73 wickets in 103 Test matches at 42.73 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:22:00">[33:22:00]</a>.
*   167 wickets in 301 ODIs at 35.48, with an economy of 4.78 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:32:00">[33:32:00]</a>.
*   20 wickets in 79 T20Is at an average of 22 and an economy of less than seven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:44:00">[33:44:00]</a>.

Gayle continued the West Indian tradition of batters bowling a lot due to a lack of specialist spinners, much like [[notable_part_time_bowlers_like_sachin_tendulkar_and_carl_hooper | Carl Hooper]] and Viv Richards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:06:00">[34:06:00]</a>. He was never picked for his bowling, but his ability meant he was used when needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:21:00">[34:21:00]</a>.

### Craig McMillan
Craig McMillan is characterized as a part-timer who believed he should have been a new-ball bowler, despite bowling around 125 km/h <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:19:00">[36:19:00]</a>.
*   28 wickets in 55 Test matches at just under 45 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:26:00">[37:26:00]</a>.
*   49 wickets in 197 ODIs at 35, with an economy of 5.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:31:00">[37:31:00]</a>.

His "ridiculously arrogant" attitude as a part-timer who thought he could win games with the ball makes him stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:04:00">[37:04:00]</a>.

### Andrew Symonds
Andrew Symonds is another player whose classification can be debated, often seen as an all-rounder in domestic cricket but a utility part-timer internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:54:00">[41:54:00]</a>.
*   24 wickets in 41 Test innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:34:00">[41:34:00]</a>.
*   133 wickets in 158 ODI innings, averaging over 37 in both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:38:00">[41:38:00]</a>.
*   8 wickets in 14 T20Is, averaging 34.5 with an economy of just under nine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:47:00">[42:47:00]</a>.

His unique ability to bowl both seam and spin meant he was used as a versatile option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:07:00">[39:07:00]</a>. However, there's a perception that Australia picked him as an all-rounder but then used him more as a part-timer at the international level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:00:00">[40:00:00]</a>.

### Charlotte Edwards
Charlotte Edwards is a controversial, yet included, part-timer, known for her perceived unusual bowling style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:09:00">[43:09:00]</a>.
*   12 wickets in 20 Test innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:30:00">[43:30:00]</a>.
*   54 wickets in 51 ODI innings (from 191 ODIs), averaging 21 with an economy of 4.3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:30:00">[43:30:00]</a>.

Despite critics describing her bowling as "horrendous" and full of "moon balls and random crap," her ODI record is surprisingly decent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:20:00">[44:20:00]</a>. She represents the type of part-timer thrown the ball occasionally for a different approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:45:00">[44:45:00]</a>.

### [[analysis_of_joe_root_as_a_modern_part_time_bowler | Joe Root]]
[[analysis_of_joe_root_as_a_modern_part_time_bowler | Joe Root]] is often debated as a potential all-rounder, but is better described as a "really, really good sixth bowler" or part-timer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:05:00">[46:05:00]</a>.
*   71 wickets in 152 Tests at 45.36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:37:00">[46:37:00]</a>.
*   28 wickets in 177 ODIs at 61.85, with an economy under six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:41:00">[46:41:00]</a>.
*   6 wickets in T20Is at 23.16, despite an economy of nearly 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:01:00">[48:01:00]</a>.

His ODI average of 61.85 suggests he's "not actually very good" at taking wickets, yet he remains "really handy to have" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:19:00">[48:19:00]</a>. His versatility in bowling different styles (leg-spin, off-spin, carrom ball, and even opening the bowling in a World Cup final) makes him a "fantastically interesting" part-timer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:16:00">[47:16:00]</a>.

### Yuvraj Singh
Yuvraj Singh's limited-overs performances as a bowler are particularly noteworthy, overshadowing his Test record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:23:00">[49:23:00]</a>.
*   9 wickets in 40 Test matches at 60.77 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:57:00">[49:57:00]</a>.
*   111 wickets in 304 ODIs at 38.68, with an economy of 5.1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:02:00">[50:02:00]</a>.
*   28 wickets in T20Is at 17.82, with an economy of 7.06 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:15:00">[50:15:00]</a>.

His bowling was crucial in India's 2011 World Cup victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:11:00">[50:11:00]</a>. Along with Michael Bevan, Yuvraj possessed the talent to be a frontline bowler if they had focused on it from a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:50:00">[50:50:00]</a>.

### Other Notable Mentions
Many other players fit the part-timer mold, each with unique characteristics:
*   **Sanath Jayasuriya**: Debatably an all-rounder as he was initially picked as a bowler before excelling at batting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:31:00">[16:31:00]</a>.
*   **Allan Border**: Took 39 Test wickets and had an ODI average of 28.36 with an economy of 4.66, surprising many with his effective part-time spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:14:00">[52:14:00]</a>.
*   **Darren Lehmann**: Considered a significant miss from a list of part-timers, with bowling averages under 30 in both Tests and ODIs, despite an aesthetically "disgusting" bowling action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:01:00">[53:01:00]</a>.
*   **Glenn Phillips**: Currently an ongoing career, but he bowls like a part-timer and thinks like one, though he could potentially become an all-rounder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:42:00">[51:42:00]</a>.
*   **Virender Sehwag**: Remembered for his effective part-time spin, though his statistics might suggest otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:47:00">[55:47:00]</a>.
*   **Kane Williamson**: Ruled ineligible for selection due to his bowling action issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:40:00">[58:40:00]</a>.

## Conclusion: The Evolving Role of Part-Time Bowlers

The definition of a part-time bowler remains highly subjective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:39">[03:37:39]</a>. It encompasses players who bowl effectively despite disinterest, those used as utility options, and even those with surprisingly good records for their limited bowling roles. The role of [[role_and_impact_of_part_time_bowlers_in_cricket | part-time bowlers]] has evolved, with some being more important in specific periods or formats. Ultimately, identifying them often comes down to a nuanced understanding of their usage, their own perception of their bowling, and how their overall contributions impact the team dynamics.

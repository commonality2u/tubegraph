Pakistan cricket, historically renowned for its potent bowling attack, has experienced a significant decline in its ability to take wickets, particularly in home Test matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. This article provides a comparative analysis of Pakistan's bowling performance across different eras and conditions, highlighting the current challenges faced by their bowlers.

## Historical Context of Pakistan's Bowling Prowess

Pakistan has had two constants throughout its existence as a cricketing nation: wickets and sexiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. Taking 20 wickets in a Test match now seems like a gargantuan task for modern-day Pakistan, which is surprising given their rich fast bowling and overall bowling heritage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

### The Fazal Era (1952-1962)
Pakistan began its Test cricket journey potentially with its greatest bowler, Fazal Mahmood, who played in their first match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. Fazal Mahmood, considered the pioneer and first hero of fast bowling for Pakistan, was so iconic he modeled for Brylcreem and had sex appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. In Pakistan's second-ever Test match, they won against India in Lucknow due to Fazal Mahmood taking 12 wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:4:00]</a>.

Across 34 Test matches from 1952 to 1962, Fazal Mahmood took 139 wickets in 53 innings at an average of approximately 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>. In seven Test wins, he claimed 65 wickets at an otherworldly average of 10.69 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>. His rate of 2.62 wickets per innings in Test cricket is only bested by seven other bowlers in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>. He achieved this while being described as the definition of cool, often with a cigarette in one hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>.

Despite Fazal's heroics, in this decade, only India and New Zealand had worse seam bowling averages than Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>. Pakistan's spinners were only better than New Zealand, averaging 44.34 runs per dismissal, and strike rates for both seamers and spinners were middling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>. This indicates that it was largely "Fazal or bust" during this era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>.

### The Barren Years (1962-1976)
In the 14 years following Fazal Mahmood's last Test match in August 1962, Pakistan's fast bowling average increased by four runs to 33 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>. Oddly, they had the second-best spin bowling average in this period, potentially influenced by Intikhab Alam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>. Their overall bowling average was only better than India and New Zealand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>. Consequently, Pakistan won just three out of 34 Test matches in this period, with their win-loss ratio only surpassing New Zealand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>. All three victories came against New Zealand, marking this as the "barren years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>.

### The Golden Era (1976-1999)
From October 1976 until the end of the millennium, Pakistan experienced a "Golden Era" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>. Sarfraz Nawaz made reverse swing mainstream for Pakistan and taught it to Imran Khan, who then passed on his knowledge to Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:16:00">[13:16:00]</a>. Wasim and Waqar became Pakistan's most prolific bowlers, destroying stumps with reverse-swinging, toe-crushing yorkers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>.

Over this 23-year period, Pakistan's seamers were only behind West Indies and South Africa in terms of average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>, despite playing mostly on flat decks at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:00">[14:06:00]</a>. Pakistan's Spinners also performed exceptionally, with a combined average of 32 runs per wicket in these 23 years, the best among all teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:45:00">[15:45:00]</a>. Abdul Qadir was the best tweaker of his generation, keeping leg-spin alive, while Saqlain Mushtaq pioneered the *doosra* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:57:00">[15:57:00]</a>. Mushtaq Ahmed was also prominent during this time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:00">[16:03:00]</a>. This era is often seen as defining Pakistan cricket due to its on-TV presence and the 1992 World Cup win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:00">[15:01:00]</a>.

### The Pre-Exile Era (2000-2009)
This era, starting at the millennium and lasting until the Sri Lankan team attack in Lahore in March 2009, saw Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis retire early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:00:00">[19:00:00]</a>. Saqlain Mushtaq's career declined after struggling against Virender Sehwag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:03:00">[19:03:00]</a>. Bowlers like Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammad Asif maintained some of Pakistan's bowling flair but were frequently injured or banned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:14:00">[19:14:00]</a>. Pakistan's bowling average in this period was only better than West Indies, Zimbabwe, and Bangladesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:22:00">[19:22:00]</a>. Danish Kaneria was the frontline leg-spinner, taking over 260 Test wickets, though at a higher average (around 35) and run rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:36:00">[19:36:00]</a>.

### The UAE Era (2009-2019)
Following the Sri Lankan attacks in March 2009, Pakistan played almost all of their home cricket in the UAE until late 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:39:00">[21:39:00]</a>. Despite these being "neutral" venues, they effectively served as home conditions for Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:48:00">[22:48:00]</a>. Under Misbah-ul-Haq, Pakistan's team, despite controversies like spot-fixing, managed to reach the number one ranking in Test cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:01:00">[23:01:00]</a>. This success was largely built on the back of Saeed Ajmal and Yasir Shah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:37:00">[23:37:00]</a>. Their careers, though not entirely overlapping in Test matches, were "demonic" in nature, leading the attack and taking most wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:52:00">[25:52:00]</a>.

In this decade, only India's spinners averaged better than Pakistan's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:58:00">[25:58:00]</a>. While fast bowlers didn't have great returns, Pakistan still boasted the fifth-best overall bowling average in the world during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:06:00">[26:06:00]</a>. Taking 20 wickets in a Test match was not an issue when Ajmal, Yasir, or even Mohammad Abbas (for a brief period) were around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:15:00">[26:15:00]</a>.

### The Return Home & Current Rut (2019-Present)
Test cricket returned to Pakistan in December 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:39:00">[27:39:00]</a>. Initially, Pakistan won series against Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and South Africa at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:44:00">[27:44:00]</a>. Bowling sides out in their own backyard was not an issue until Australia toured in March 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:56:00">[27:56:00]</a>.

Since the start of the Australia series in March 2022, Pakistan has endured a winless streak in 10 home Test matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:21:00">[29:21:00]</a>. This period includes two drawn games against Australia, a 3-0 sweep by England (Pakistan's first-ever home Test series sweep), a nil-nil draw against New Zealand, and a 2-0 sweep by Bangladesh in Rawalpindi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:25:00">[29:25:00]</a>. In these 10 matches, Pakistan took only 128 wickets and managed to take 20 wickets in a Test on just one occasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:53:00">[29:53:00]</a>.

## Current Bowling Performance: Home vs. Away

### Home Struggles
While some attribute the wicket drought to flat pitches, Pakistan has historically always had flat pitches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:21:00">[32:21:00]</a>. In these 10 winless home Tests, Pakistan's local bowlers averaged 47 with the ball, while opposition bowlers averaged 36, an 11-run difference per wicket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:44:00">[32:44:00]</a>. This means Pakistan's bowlers were more than 100 runs worse per innings than the opposition's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:05:00">[33:05:00]</a>.

Opposition seamers averaged 31 with the ball, whereas Pakistan's seamers averaged 47 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:37:00">[33:37:00]</a>. Similarly, overseas spinners averaged 40, while Pakistan's spinners averaged 46 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:49:00">[34:49:00]</a>. This clearly indicates that pitches are not the sole pain point, as opposition bowlers are still taking wickets effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:55:00">[32:55:00]</a>.

Since the start of 2022, Pakistan's pace bowling average at home is 38 runs per wicket, the worst in the world among teams with a minimum of five Test matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:34:00">[35:34:00]</a>. Their spin bowling average is 41, only better than Ireland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:41:00">[35:41:00]</a>. Overall, Pakistan has the second-worst bowling average (39.46 runs per dismissal) in these two and a half years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:48:00">[35:48:00]</a>.

### Away Success
Despite their home struggles, Pakistan's away numbers are still relatively good in this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:15:00">[34:15:00]</a>. Their seamers average 30.2 and spinners just under 34, amounting to an overall bowling average of 31.72, which is the second-best in the world since the start of 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:17:00">[34:17:00]</a>. Pakistan has won Tests away from home in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and West Indies during this period, though these were not against the strongest teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:10:00">[35:10:00]</a>.

## Factors Contributing to the Decline in Home Conditions

### Shaheen Shah Afridi's Injury and Form
Shaheen Shah Afridi's performance has not been the same since his knee injury in a Test match in Sri Lanka in July 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:01:00">[40:01:00]</a>. Before the injury, he had 99 wickets in 25 Tests at less than 25 runs apiece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:12:00">[40:12:00]</a>. Since then, in five Test matches, he has averaged 41 with the ball, which is unacceptable for a frontline bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:20:00">[40:20:00]</a>.

He was rushed back for a World Cup and got injured again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:00:00">[41:00:00]</a>. Shaheen now appears slower, with less swing and athleticism, resembling an "impersonator" of his former self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:09:00">[41:09:00]</a>. Speeds have dropped significantly, sometimes into the 120s kilometers per hour, and the lateral movement is gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:33:00">[43:33:00]</a>. Notably, Shaheen has only played four of the 10 winless home Tests for Pakistan, with three of those being pre-injury against Australia, indicating he is not the sole root cause of the overall bowling issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:21:00">[43:21:00]</a>.

### Pace Bowling Depth and Management
Pakistan's pace bowling woes are compounded by:
*   **Lack of experience and continuity**: Excluding Shaheen and Naseem Shah, Pakistan has used six other pacers in the 10 winless home Tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:19:00">[46:19:00]</a>. Only Hasan Ali among them had played Test cricket before this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:00:00">[48:00:00]</a>. These bowlers exhibit negligible experience and lack continuity in selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:07:00">[48:07:00]</a>.
*   **Poor injury management**: This is a persistent issue in Pakistan cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:18:00">[48:18:00]</a>. Key bowlers like Naseem Shah are frequently injured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:35:00">[44:35:00]</a>.
*   **Sheer lack of pace**: A nation known for express pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:28:00">[48:28:00]</a>, Pakistan has only seen Haris Rauf provide express pace in these 10 Tests, but he broke down after 13 overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:38:00">[48:38:00]</a>.
*   **Discarded Talent**: Mohammad Abbas, who averaged 23 with 90 Test wickets when discarded by Pakistan, has since taken 192 wickets for Hampshire at an average of 21 in first-class cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:14:00">[54:14:00]</a>.

### Spin Bowling Issues
Abrar Ahmed, Pakistan's current frontline spinner, had a phenomenal start to his Test career, taking 11 wickets on debut against England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:00:00">[50:00:00]</a>. However, he has since dropped off, with 29 wickets in five home Tests at an average north of 36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:07:00">[50:07:00]</a>. This decline might be due to opponents working him out, his injuries, and insufficient match practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:17:00">[50:17:00]</a>.

Other Pakistani spinners like Yasir Shah (who declined significantly after Pakistan returned home from the UAE), Zahid Mahmood, Sajid Khan, and Nauman Ali have all averaged over 36 with the ball since Pakistan's return from the UAE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:48:00">[50:48:00]</a>. In contrast, five overseas spinners have performed better than Pakistan's tweakers in this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:15:00">[51:15:00]</a>. Shadab Khan, once a promising spinner, is now more of a batting all-rounder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:01:00">[55:01:00]</a>.

### Structural and Professionalism Issues
Pakistan cricket lacks proper systems and relies on a "savior complex," always looking for a hero to fix everything rather than establishing structure and continuity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:52:00">[45:52:00]</a>. The PCB's amateur approach, including poor financial management (e.g., not paying players for months) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:14:00">[52:14:00]</a> and inconsistent selection, is detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:42:00">[49:42:00]</a>. This contrasts sharply with other major cricketing nations that have professionalized their operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:08:00">[53:08:00]</a>. Workload management is also poor, with frontline bowlers playing in insignificant matches and then being unavailable for crucial Tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:16">[01:00:16]</a>.

## Conclusion
Pakistan's current struggles in Test bowling at home are multi-faceted. While flat pitches play a role, the inability of Pakistan's bowlers to perform as well as their counterparts on the same surfaces points to deeper issues beyond just playing conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:45:00">[34:45:00]</a>. The decline is rooted in the individual form and fitness of key bowlers like Shaheen Shah Afridi, a lack of consistent, experienced depth in the pace and spin departments, and significant structural problems within Pakistan cricket that hinder professionalism and continuity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:51:00">[48:51:00]</a>. Pakistan's supreme bowling legacy is, for now, a thing of the past, requiring fundamental systemic changes to regain its consistent bowling prowess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:26:00">[56:26:00]</a>.

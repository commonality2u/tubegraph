Himanish Ganju, a cosmologist by profession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, served as a former analyst for the Indian men's cricket team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. His journey into [[role_of_analysts_in_cricket | cricket analysis]] began from a personal curiosity and evolved into a high-profile, yet discreet, role within one of the world's most scrutinized sports teams.

## Journey into Cricket Analysis

Ganju's foray into [[analyzing_cricket_data | cricket data]] started around 2015 when he was jobless and awaiting grad school applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. He sought answers to basic cricket questions, like how batting averages had changed in Test cricket over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. Finding existing databases poorly maintained, he taught himself Python to gather and manage his own [[analyzing_cricket_data | cricket data]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:46]</a>.

### The Axar Patel Anomaly

A pivotal moment was his analysis of cricketer Axar Patel following the 2021 England series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Ganju observed that Patel bowled wide of the crease and didn't turn the ball at all, prompting him to investigate through data why he was taking wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:19]</a>. This deep dive revealed Patel to be "really different and really anomalous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:44]</a>.

The article on Axar Patel took approximately two to three weeks to conceive and write <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:27]</a>. While most of his pieces for Cricinfo coalesced over several weeks from a "triggering question" to data formulation and narrative construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:03:12]</a>, the Axar piece was faster due to the anomalous data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:32]</a>. The article was published on his personal Substack because there was uncertainty about using Hawkeye data for Cricinfo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:57]</a>. It gained significant attention, receiving around 3,400 likes on Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:08]</a>.

Ganju views Hawkeye data as a "new prism into the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>, allowing analysts to rigorously confirm or challenge clich√©s, such as precisely defining a "good length" in bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:53]</a>. His Axar Patel piece was, he believes, the first public article to utilize this data to decode a player's wicket-taking mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:16]</a>.

## Recruitment by Rahul Dravid

The turning point came when a video based on Ganju's Axar Patel article reached Rahul Dravid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:18]</a>, who was then the coach of the Indian team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:20:00]</a>. Ganju received an email from Dravid, which he initially dismissed as a prank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:19:10]</a>. After confirming its authenticity through Rajesh at Cricinfo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:22]</a>, they had a Zoom call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:28]</a>. Dravid expressed interest in Ganju's unique approach to looking at the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:50]</a>.

Ganju, being a fan of the Indian team and Rahul Dravid, was "gunning" for an opportunity to help them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:32]</a>. Within one or two months of their initial talks in April 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>, the plan was formalized for him to join as a consultant analyst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:40]</a>. He met the team management in Florida during T20 matches in August 2022, which helped build trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:49]</a>.

## The Role of an Analyst: Responsibilities and Challenges

As an analyst for the Indian team, Ganju's primary focus was on T20 cricket, specifically leveraging tracking data to better understand bowlers and batters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:43]</a>. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) was helpful and flexible, providing him with the core data needed for his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:23:14]</a>.

### Confidentiality and Public Profile

A key aspect of his role was its confidential nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:13]</a>. This decision was mutual and strategic to "cut out the noise" given the high-profile and high-risk nature of the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:29]</a>. As someone with a semi-public presence on Twitter, secrecy prevented external pressures, information leaks, or people asking for things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:25:02]</a>. This meant he stopped tweeting about Indian cricket and writing for Cricinfo during his tenure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:24]</a>.

### Relationship with Players and Coaches

Ganju primarily communicated his research and insights to the coaches, who then decided how to use that information with the players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:48]</a>. This "lay" between the analyst and the players prevented "muddling" players with excessive numbers or research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:55]</a>. He only spoke directly with Rohit Sharma (the captain, who attended some meetings) and Ravichandran Ashwin (who had read his previous article and was known to be a fellow "nerd" interested in data) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:33:01]</a>. Virat Kohli, for instance, only learned about Ganju's role at a team dinner at the end of their stint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:18">[00:33:40]</a>.

### Powerlessness and Emotional Detachment

A significant challenge was the feeling of powerlessness once a match began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:36:02]</a>. As Rahul Dravid explained, once the game starts, the analyst's and even the coach's role becomes limited; players are on the field and must execute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:46]</a>.

Losing the [[Cricket World Cup 2023 analysis | T20 World Cup]] semi-final in Adelaide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:05]</a> was particularly frustrating, but Ganju learned to emotionally detach during the [[Cricket World Cup 2023 analysis | ODI World Cup]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:52">[00:38:31]</a>. He would submit his research one or two days before each game and then disengage, sometimes even sleeping through parts of the matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:34">[00:38:43]</a>. This helped manage the intense emotional attachment that comes with being an analyst for the team you love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:52">[00:38:17]</a>.

## Impact and Satisfaction

Despite the challenges, the role brought immense satisfaction. Seeing a plan implemented in a live game, such as the delivery that dismissed Heinrich Klaasen in the [[Cricket World Cup 2023 analysis | T20 World Cup final]] (a wide slower ball that Ganju had discussed as a possibility the evening before the match) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:37">[00:43:57]</a>, provided an unparalleled "rush" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:23">[00:40:29]</a>.

The greatest satisfaction, however, came from the fact that Rohit Sharma and Rahul Dravid, cricketers of high stature, treated him as an equal and found his insights useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:27]</a>. This validated his work, proving it was "useful stuff" for a high-profile team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:38">[00:41:46]</a>.

### Changing the Team Culture

Ganju highlights that his most significant contribution, beyond the World Cup win, was helping to "change the culture" within the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:22">[00:49:52]</a>. Under Rohit Sharma and Rahul Dravid, there was a commitment to being the "most knowledgeable Team Management out there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:21">[00:50:24]</a>. This involved extensively leveraging [[analyzing_cricket_data | data]], from bowling speeds and angles to specific shot data for batters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:29">[00:50:43]</a>. This "transformative" shift in how the game was viewed and analyzed for players and coaches was a source of immense professional pride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:50:12]</a>.

### Rahul Dravid's Radical Approach

Ganju passionately defends Rahul Dravid against common narratives that he didn't understand white-ball [[Cricket Analysis and Commentary on the Match | cricket analysis and commentary on the match]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:58">[00:48:03]</a>. He describes Dravid as "perhaps the most radical cricketer" he's met in terms of thinking about T20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:51">[00:47:57]</a>. Dravid had the "right idea from the get-go" and understood all formats of the game at a rare level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:07">[00:48:30]</a>.

In essence, Himanish Ganju's experience as an analyst for the Indian cricket team underscores the profound impact of [[analyzing_cricket_data | data analysis]] and strategic thinking in modern cricket, even from a "shadow" role behind the scenes.

[[jasprit_bumrahs_impact_in_all_cricket_formats | Jasprit Bumrah]] has been a standout performer for India in the ongoing Test series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:58">[00:50:58]</a>, with his performance significantly impacting the team's standing.

## Performance Highlights
In the recent Gabba Test, [[jasprit_bumrahs_performance_across_formats | Bumrah]] delivered a stellar performance, taking 6 for 76 in the first innings and 3 for 18 in the third <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:59">[00:50:59]</a>. His total wickets in the series already stand at 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:06">[00:51:06]</a>. A statistic highlighted that while [[bumrahs_performance_and_captaincy_impact | Bumrah]] has 21 wickets, Rohit Sharma only has 19 runs in the series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>. His current Test bowling average is 19.52, and he is approaching 200 Test wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:54">[00:52:54]</a>.

## Workload and Injury Concerns
Despite his exceptional [[bumrahs_performance_and_captaincy_impact | performance]], concerns about [[bumrahs_performance_and_captaincy_impact | Bumrah's workload]] and potential injury risks have been raised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:27">[00:51:27]</a>. In one innings, he bowled 28 overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:33">[00:51:33]</a>, and at one point, he bowled 25 out of Australia's first 100 overs, accounting for a quarter of the total overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:36">[00:51:36]</a>.

However, a closer look at the data reveals that his workload might not be excessively high compared to other top pacers. Across three Tests, [[jasprit_bumrahs_impact_in_all_cricket_formats | Bumrah]] has bowled 88 overs, averaging around 30 overs per Test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:19">[00:52:19]</a>. This is fewer overs than Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins, and only five more than Tim Southee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:26">[00:52:26]</a>. With a week-long break before the next match, he has time to recover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:47">[00:52:47]</a>.

## "Bumrah Bus" and Team Impact
The podcast highlights a "massive gulf" between [[jasprit_bumrahs_impact_in_all_cricket_formats | Bumrah]] and the rest of the Indian bowlers, making it seem like "two different games of Cricket going on" when he bowls compared to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:08">[00:53:08]</a>. This phenomenon has been termed the "Bumrah Bus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:48">[00:54:48]</a>. For instance, in an innings where [[jasprit_bumrahs_performance_across_formats | Bumrah]] took 6 for 76, the opposition still managed to score 445 runs, indicating a lack of support from other bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:21">[00:53:21]</a>.

Despite this, other bowlers like Mohammed Siraj have also performed well, with Siraj having 13 wickets at an average of 24, comparable to Pat Cummins' figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:53">[00:53:53]</a>. The podcast notes that in the second innings of the Gabba Test, Akash Deep and Siraj seemed more likely to take wickets than [[jasprit_bumrahs_performance_across_formats | Bumrah]] for a period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:14">[00:56:14]</a>. The partnership between Akash Deep and [[jasprit_bumrahs_performance_across_formats | Bumrah]] at the end of the first innings was crucial in helping India avoid the follow-on, effectively drawing the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:46">[00:39:46]</a>.

The **[[impact_of_indias_injuries_and_player_absences_on_the_test_series | impact of India's injuries and player absences]]**, especially the likely absence of Mohammed Shami, places an even greater burden on [[jasprit_bumrahs_impact_in_all_cricket_formats | Bumrah]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:53">[00:43:53]</a>.

This article discusses the captaincy and strategic flexibility of Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB), focusing on their performance in a recent match.

## RCB's Captaincy and Bowling Strategy
RCB's bowling faced significant challenges, struggling to take wickets for a considerable period during a match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. The team, led by a younger, less experienced captain, faces a "tough bowling lineup" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, which complicates wicket-taking. The need to "manufacture wickets a little bit more" will be a key area for RCB throughout the season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

While their bowling in the first half of the game was described as "really, really rough" due to poor lines and lengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>, it improved in the second half, forcing the opposition to take risks from well-bowled deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.

## Batting Approach and Flexibility
On the positive side, RCB demonstrated their planned batting strength, with [[phil_salts_t20_strategy_with_rcb | Phil Salt]] able to play aggressively, knowing that Virat Kohli at the other end could also score quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. This freedom allowed Salt to perform effectively, reminiscent of his play at KKR where he had a deep batting lineup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Number Three Batting Order
A point of interest was RCB's decision regarding the number three batting position, particularly with Devdutt Padikkal (DDP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Despite the team being significantly ahead in the chase and not needing a traditional number three, DDP was sent in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. This was seen as an "odd decision" that showed a "certain inflexibility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

The commentator questioned why DDP wasn't held back to be used later if the team faced trouble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. It was suggested that a more sensible approach would have been to send in players like Padar and Livingston first to maximize net run rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Although DDP's quick dismissal didn't impact the outcome of this specific match, it highlighted a potential rigidity in [[strategy_and_decisionmaking_in_cricket | strategy and decision-making in cricket]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

> "I thought it was an odd decision that they showed an inflexibility like there was no real like if you have a player like him in your lineup why not just hold him to later and then use him if you get yourself into any trouble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>

The team appears to view DDP as their number three batsman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. However, there's a debate about whether a traditional anchor is needed at that position, with some suggesting a more aggressive player like Livingston at number three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. The commentator prefers RCB to go "all in" with aggressive players like Jitesh, Livingston, and David down the order, rather than adding another anchor, which could affect Virat Kohli's batting style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

Batters frequently encounter significant [[challenges_facing_batsmen_on_indian_pitches | challenges]] when facing left-arm spin, particularly on pitches that offer assistance to bowlers. A notable anecdote illustrating these difficulties, and one player's remarkable response, involves Indian cricketing legend Sunil Gavaskar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Sunil Gavaskar's Masterclass Against Raghuram Bhat

During a first-class knockout match between Mumbai and Karnataka, played on a "ranked turner" pitch that was heavily spinning by the fourth or fifth day, Mumbai's batters struggled significantly against Karnataka's renowned left-arm spinner, Raghuram Bhat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Bhat, who had also played one Test match for India, posed a considerable threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

Observing his teammates' struggles, Sunil Gavaskar, despite being a right-handed batter, famously stated that the challenge was manageable if played with the spin, or that he would demonstrate its ease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. In an extraordinary display of adaptability, Gavaskar went to the crease and batted left-handed for six overs against Raghuram Bhat on the turning pitch, successfully surviving the spell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

This remarkable feat highlighted not only his exceptional skill but also his willingness to adapt his technique to counter the specific [[challenges_faced_by_batsmen_in_modern_test_cricket | challenges]] posed by a left-arm spinner on a difficult surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Further demonstrating his unparalleled talent, Gavaskar reportedly batted right-handed at the other end against an off-spinner simultaneously, making his performance even more remarkable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

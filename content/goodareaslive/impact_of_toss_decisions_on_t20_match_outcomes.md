From: [[goodareaslive]] <br/> 

The phenomenon of teams consistently opting to chase totals in T20 cricket has become deeply ingrained in the sport's philosophy, despite statistical evidence suggesting a less significant advantage than widely perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This "chasing obsession" has led to automatic decision-making at the toss, often overriding context-specific analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## Historical Trend of Chasing

Since 2013, teams have preferred to bat second more often than bat first after winning the toss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. By 2017, this philosophy had become "berserk," with approximately 75% of teams choosing to field first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. This trend is almost as automatic in T20 cricket as the traditional decision to bat first in Test cricket, where conditions aren't completely favoring bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

## The Statistical Reality

While there is an advantage for teams chasing in T20s from 2015 onwards, it is minor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Statistics show that when bowling first, teams win 53% of the time, compared to 47% when batting first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. This 6% advantage is considered considerable but not as overwhelming as often perceived by fans and potentially even players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Many fans, for instance, believe the advantage is closer to 70% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. If the dew factor and chasing were as impactful as often thought, the win percentage for chasing teams would likely be significantly higher than 53% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

## Factors Influencing Toss Decisions

Teams often consider several factors when making toss decisions:
*   **Knowledge of the Total**: Knowing the target allows teams to bat in a specific way, whereas setting a total can involve more risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
*   **Dew Factor**: The potential for dew encourages teams to chase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. However, it's questioned whether dew plays as significant a role as commonly believed, as it doesn't always come in the second innings and can even appear in the first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
*   **Pitch Conditions**: Teams often assess the pitch for how it might flatten out or slow down, which impacts the optimal decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Understanding the [[impact_of_wicket_and_pitch_conditions_on_cricket_matches | impact of wicket and pitch conditions on cricket matches]] is crucial.
*   **Analyst Influence**: The chasing philosophy largely originated from analysts, with players subsequently going "all in" on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Environmental Conditions**: Factors like extreme heat and humidity can drain fielding teams, potentially impacting their batting performance later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>. Rain, which makes the ball wet, can also hinder bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>.
*   **Lack of Nuance**: Despite these factors, teams often make decisions automatically rather than considering the specific ground, opposition, and their own team's strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

## Team-Specific Trends and Paradoxes

### England's Obsession
From 2016 onwards, England opted to bat first only 6% to 7% of the time, and between 2017 and 2021, they did not choose to bat first at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. This steadfast commitment to bowling first persists even on surfaces where batting first would be advantageous, such as the Guyana surface against India, which was expected to slow down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. Ironically, England has won over 50% of their games when they *have* opted to bat first in this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.

### Afghanistan's Counter-Approach
In contrast to England, Afghanistan is the only international side since 2016 that has chosen to bat first more than 30% of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. This strategy makes sense given their squad composition, which leans towards setting totals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.

### Pakistan's Dilemma
Pakistan often struggles with setting totals, yet they consistently choose to field first in bilateral T20s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. This approach prevents them from practicing and improving their ability to bat first, which is crucial for T20 World Cup preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. When forced to bat first, as by Jos Buttler in England or by the USA in the T20 World Cup, they have faced difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

### India's Adaptability
While India also tends to bowl first automatically like England, they showed a crucial shift in the recent T20 World Cup, making "cricket decisions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. Rohit Sharma, their captain, stated he would have batted first in Guyana, and they did bat first in the final, which worked out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. This indicates a recognition of a "gray area" in toss decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>.

### Franchise vs. International Cricket
Franchise T20 teams show an even stronger preference for fielding first, with CPL teams opting to field first 85% of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Despite this, teams batting first in the CPL still win 50% of their games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. This suggests that the obsession is more pronounced in franchise cricket, possibly due to more level teams and a desire to rack up wins early in a long tournament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

## Consequences and Future Considerations

The consistent, unthinking adoption of the "field first" strategy can be detrimental:
*   **Lack of Preparation**: Teams might not adequately prepare for situations where they have to bat first, impacting their performance in crucial knockout games like T20 World Cups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.
*   **Predictability**: An automatic decision-making process makes teams predictable and potentially vulnerable to counter-strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
*   **Misinterpretation of Data**: While backed by data, teams might be stopping at the initial conversation about the toss without delving into the nuanced details of specific conditions, player matchups, or short boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>.
*   **Dew Problem Re-evaluation**: The widespread belief in a significant "dew problem" might be overstated given the win percentages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>.

The semi-finals of the recent T20 World Cup highlighted this irony: Afghanistan, a bat-first team, opted to bat first in Trinidad and were bowled out for 56 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>. England, a bowl-first team, opted to bowl first in Guyana and lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>. In both instances, the teams might have been better off doing the opposite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>.

Going forward, cricket might need to consider rule changes, such as allowing the away team to decide what they want to do after the toss, to introduce more variability and strategic thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>. As T20 scores escalate to 260-280, the pressure of chasing could also fundamentally alter tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>.

In conclusion, while a slight statistical advantage exists for chasing teams, the "chasing obsession" often reflects an "unthinking trend" rather than a fully informed strategic decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>. Teams, especially international ones, should prioritize preparing for both batting first and second in anticipation of crucial tournaments, rather than blindly following a single strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.

Mumbai Indians (MI) have started their season with two away losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:23">[00:37:23]</a>, prompting discussion about their current form despite having a strong squad on paper when Jasprit Bumrah is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:04">[00:36:04]</a>.

## Current Challenges
The team is currently facing issues with batting form across the lineup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:08">[00:36:08]</a>. Their fielding performance has also been notably poor, with players "finding new ways to stuff up in the field" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>.

### Individual Player Concerns
*   **[[rohit_sharmas_performance_for_mumbai_indians | Rohit Sharma]]**: Concerns have been raised about [[rohit_sharmas_performance_for_mumbai_indians | Rohit Sharma's]] fluctuating form for Mumbai Indians in the IPL, noting it has been "more cold than hot" for a while <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>. Despite adopting an aggressive, "big swinging dick" approach for India in white-ball cricket that has transformed their play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:49">[00:40:49]</a>, he appears to bat differently for Mumbai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:04">[00:43:04]</a>. It's speculated that this might be an "existential thing" related to his post-captaincy role within the team's ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:47">[00:41:47]</a>. Interestingly, his best IPL numbers statistically are when batting at number four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:22">[00:43:22]</a>.
*   **Hardik Pandya**: His batting performance has been inconsistent, notably playing a defensive shot on a pitch suited for pace when 16 runs were needed in an over, which was described as a shot for the 23rd over of an ODI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>.

## Historical Context and Team Philosophy
Mumbai Indians are known for historically starting seasons poorly, even in their championship-winning years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>. They have a tendency to "edge their way in" to the playoffs and then transform into a different side, often winning championships from that point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>.

Their strategy for winning championships involves aiming for 16-18 points, typically by winning five out of seven home games and three to four away games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:33">[00:37:33]</a>.

Mumbai Indians are recognized as an innovative team that provides significant opportunities to youngsters, discovering talent not only for the franchise but also for India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:17">[00:38:17]</a>. Notable examples include Jasprit Bumrah, the Pandya Brothers, and Yuzvendra Chahal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:28">[00:38:28]</a>. The team maintains a high standard of performance and is expected to put pressure on players to improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>.

Despite their slow start, there's a belief that the squad has enough talent to go on a streak of five or six wins in a row <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:55">[00:39:55]</a>. However, it's acknowledged that while slow starts can lead to championships, they can also lead to continued poor performance, and the team needs to start winning soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>.

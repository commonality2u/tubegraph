The current Test match between Australia and India has seen remarkable swings in momentum, defying many initial expectations that declared India "out of the series" or unable to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. The game's trajectory has shifted dramatically, making all three results (Australia win, draw, India win) still possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:52">[03:08:52]</a>. While Australia remains the most likely team to win, India is in a potentially winnable or drawable position, needing to chase just over 400 runs in four sessions if Australia quickly rolls them and sets a target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.

## India's Comeback and Key Partnerships

A "remarkable partnership" has been central to India's resurgence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. This partnership involved two younger players, who were backed by Rohit and Gautam Gambhir despite recent criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. The decision to play a "six bowler, eighth batter" lineup, initially questioned by some, ultimately proved effective in saving India with the bat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

## Player Performances

### Nitesh Kumar Reddy
Nitesh Kumar Reddy is receiving significant respect for his performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. His scoring sector chart shows he scores runs "absolutely everywhere around the ground," indicating versatility as a batter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. His strongest scoring area is cover, but he shows a good mixture of scoring shots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>.

Reddy's batting style exhibits "good normal quality Test batting," with a balanced approach: defending 30%, attacking 28%, rotating strike 22%, and not playing a shot to 19% of balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. While his recent innings is an outlier in his first-class career, his composure and control suggest he has the potential to be a genuine number six batter in Test cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.

He has been particularly effective against Nathan Lyon and Scotty Boland, while Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc (around the wicket) have given him more trouble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>. Reddy is among a select group of Indian batters aged 25 or less to score 200 runs in a series in Australia, doing so with the highest average so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>. He also has the second-most runs for India in the series and boasts the best false shot percentage (16%) among players with over 150 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>. His ability to come down the wicket to both spinners and quicks is notable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>.

Despite his batting success, Reddy's bowling contribution in this series has been minimal, bowling only 7.4% of the overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12:00">[10:12:00]</a>. This means India has essentially played him as a specialist number seven or eight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>. For him to be a long-term success, he would likely need to establish himself as a good enough number six batter and then consistently bowl more overs, similar to the roles of Paul Collingwood or Shane Watson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>.

### Washington Sundar
Washington Sundar's batting was described as very solid, allowing Reddy to bat normally without worrying about the other end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13:00]</a>. He has faced over 100 balls in an innings four times in his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:00">[12:46:00]</a>. Both Sundar and Reddy show a "very uncorruptible" game, meaning there is little that can go wrong with their batting on a good day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:00">[13:34:00]</a>. Sundar's overall Test cricket record is exceptional against tough opponents, both home and away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:45:00">[21:45:00]</a>. His mechanical bowling is good, but he needs to develop it further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:56:00">[23:56:00]</a>. He is seen as a potentially fantastic number seven batter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:08:00">[24:08:00]</a>.

## Team Strategy and Challenges

### Indian Cricket Batting Struggles
India has struggled to score decent totals in the first innings for a long time, putting immense pressure on their bowlers like Ashwin, Jadeja, and Bumrah to bail them out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:00">[14:15:00]</a>. This issue was highlighted in a recent series against New Zealand where the bowlers couldn't compensate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:59:00">[14:59:00]</a>.

The performance of Reddy and Sundar suggests India could potentially solidify the number six and seven positions, especially as Jadeja ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>. Nailing these spots would provide India with permanent five bowling options, allowing them to use players like Reddy or Sundar when conditions are favorable, rather than out of necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05:00">[13:05:00]</a>.

Regarding player positioning, Shubman Gill might open or bat at number three when Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma retire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:23:00">[31:23:00]</a>. There's no rush to push Reddy to number five given his young age and lack of consistent first-class runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:08:00">[30:08:00]</a>. Number six is considered a suitable position for him as a part-time bowler, whereas at number seven, more overs would be expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:12:00">[31:12:00]</a>.

The current situation with Reddy highlights the "Ashton Agar syndrome" or conundrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:28:00">[32:28:00]</a>. Reddy was initially selected to provide a full seam bowling option but has instead excelled as a specialist number seven batter, effectively flipping his primary role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:40:00">[33:40:00]</a>.

### Australian Captaincy
Pat Cummins' captaincy has drawn criticism, with some observers feeling Australia looked "broken" and "bored" at times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:00">[18:00:00]</a>. Specific tactical decisions, such as Mitch Marsh bowling straight after tea, were questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:22:00">[18:22:00]</a>. While the wicket wasn't offering much, Australia seemed to run out of ideas, relying heavily on Scotty Boland as the only effective bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:48:00">[18:48:00]</a>. Despite this, if Australia still wins the game, the criticism may be overshadowed by the result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:34:00">[19:34:00]</a>.

### All-rounders vs. Specialists
The debate between specialist players and all-rounders in Test cricket is discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:07:00">[34:07:00]</a>. While historically dominant teams like the West Indies and Australia often played specialists due to their "great" bowlers who could guarantee 20 wickets, this approach is only feasible if a team possesses such a bowling attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:10:00">[34:10:00]</a>.

India, at the moment, does not have four "great" bowlers in all conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:11:00">[36:11:00]</a>. They have Jasprit Bumrah (a great bowler), Ashwin and Jadeja (who can face problems overseas), and Mohammed Shami (a fantastic bowler, but perhaps not an all-time great) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:17:00">[36:17:00]</a>. The inclusion of players like Nitesh Reddy as the fourth seamer in this series highlights their need for flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:44:00">[36:44:00]</a>. Teams should leverage their available strengths, and for current India, that strength lies in the flexibility provided by all-rounders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:59:00">[36:59:00]</a>. The reason for India's struggles in this series is primarily due to their bowlers, outside of Bumrah, not consistently taking wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:12:00">[37:12:00]</a>.

## Series Outlook
The match result remains uncertain, with all three outcomes possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:52">[03:08:52]</a>. Australia winning is still considered the most likely result, ahead of a draw, as the pitch is expected to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:06:00">[38:06:00]</a>. The performance of Nitesh Kumar Reddy has been pivotal in keeping this Test match, and potentially the series, alive for a "straight shootout at the SCG" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:35:00">[20:35:00]</a>.

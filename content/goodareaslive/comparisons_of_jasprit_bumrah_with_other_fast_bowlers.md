Jasprit Bumrah is currently experiencing a "freakish" and "other-worldly" peak in his career, operating at a level potentially unprecedented in cricket history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. His dominance spans across all formats and playing conditions, making him "unplayable" at times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

## Unprecedented Peak Across Formats

Since returning from injury, Jasprit Bumrah has taken 74 wickets in 31 international matches across formats, averaging less than 16 runs per wicket and maintaining an economy rate under four runs per over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>. This multi-format dominance leads to comparisons with some of the game's greatest bowlers:

*   **Past Legends**:
    *   **Vaqar Younis**: Compared to his early 1990s peak before injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.
    *   **Dale Steyn**: Known for wreaking havoc across formats in more recent times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.
    *   **West Indian Fast Bowlers**: The "Four Horsemen" quartet from the 1980s are mentioned for their comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.
    *   **Michael Holding**: Although Holding played fewer games and bowled in fewer innings, and had one or two fewer wickets than Bumrah's current numbers, it was a different era of cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.
*   **Modern Era**:
    *   **Mitchell Starc & Glenn McGrath**: Their dominant phases in World Cups are mentioned as comparable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.
    *   **Muttiah Muralitharan**: Had two years where he took over 120 international wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.
    *   **Glenn McGrath**: Took 119 wickets in 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.
    *   **Mitchell Johnson**: Took 113 wickets in one year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.
    *   **Shane Warne**: Had a year with 121 wickets at an average of 19 across all formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.
    *   **Allan Donald**: Achieved an average of 18 with over 100 wickets in a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.
    *   **Joel Garner**: Also took over 100 international wickets in one year at an average of 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.

While others have achieved high wicket counts in a year, the nature of international cricket was different, and there was no IPL to consider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>. Therefore, while not on the same level of sheer wicket-taking volume, Bumrah's impact is clearly comparable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.

## T20 Prowess: Outperforming Specialists

In T20 cricket, Bumrah is described as "literally unplayable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. His economy rate of 4.24 in T20 Internationals since injury is remarkable, especially in a high-scoring format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. His performance in the IPL 2024, the highest-scoring T20 tournament ever, further highlights his unique ability, maintaining an economy rate of 6.5 while taking 20 wickets in 13 games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>.

*   **[[comparison_of_historical_and_modern_death_bowlers | Lasith Malinga]]**: Considered one of the greatest T20 bowlers and a death-over specialist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>. Bumrah is statistically better than Malinga in 75% of an IPL game in terms of true economy, especially in the last three overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>.

## Unique Action and Accuracy

[[jasprit_bumrahs_unique_bowling_techniques | Jasprit Bumrah's unique bowling action]] is a core component of his success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.

*   **Compared to other bowlers with unique actions**:
    *   **[[comparison_of_historical_and_modern_death_bowlers | Lasith Malinga]]**: Both have outlier actions as the core of their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.
    *   **Joel Garner**: Similar in that his action was central to his success, though Garner was 6'7" and relied on height <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>.
    *   **Naveen-ul-Haq**: Has a similar action, rushing batters at 86 mph, indicating the advantage of delivering the ball half a meter closer to the batter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>. However, he lacks the other tools Bumrah possesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:00">[10:34:00]</a>.
    *   **Wasim Akram**: Bumrah's short, non-standard run-up is likened to Wasim Akram's in the latter part of his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>.

Bumrah's accuracy is also unparalleled. Unlike most bowlers who struggle to vary length, Bumrah can hit multiple lengths for his different variations consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:20:00">[13:20:00]</a>.

*   **Compared to accurate bowlers**:
    *   **Vernon Philander**: Known for extreme accuracy and wobble seam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:55:00">[12:55:00]</a>.
    *   **Glenn McGrath**: Famous for hitting a coin on a good length repeatedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>.
    *   **Mohammad Asif**: Described as very accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:00">[13:11:00]</a>.
    *   **Pat Cummins**: Considered one of the most accurate fast bowlers in terms of line, but Bumrah has distinct "clumps of lengths" for different balls, a rare skill for a fast bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:56:00">[14:56:00]</a>.

## Impact Beyond Wickets

[[jasprit_bumrahs_impact_in_all_cricket_formats | Jasprit Bumrah's impact]] extends beyond his own wicket-taking ability, influencing how batters approach the overs around him.

*   **Sunil Narine & T. Natarajan**: Bumrah is second only to Sunil Narine in the IPL for "assisted wickets" (wickets falling on the delivery immediately after his over) and just behind T. Natarajan in assisted wickets per total balls bowled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:41:00">[22:41:00]</a>. This indicates batters intentionally play him out, building pressure that leads to dismissals in subsequent overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:01:00">[23:01:00]</a>.
*   **Sunil Narine & Rashid Khan**: Other bowlers like Sunil Narine and Rashid Khan also have a similar impact, keeping things tight and forcing batters to target other bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:40:00">[27:40:00]</a>. However, Bumrah's bowling pattern is so well-known that teams plan their innings around his overs, knowing when he will bowl and choosing to attack the overs around him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:28:00">[28:28:00]</a>.

## Adaptability and Skill Evolution

Bumrah can bowl at different speeds, being most effective at express pace and with his cutters, but remarkably, he also maintains an economy of four runs an over when bowling within himself (130-140 km/h) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:01:00">[30:01:00]</a>.

*   **Dale Steyn & Waqar Younis**: Unlike Steyn, who was "balls to the wall all the time," or Waqar Younis, who bowled every ball to his limit, Bumrah can "coast" and still be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:23:00">[31:23:00]</a>.
*   **Joel Garner**: Garner also had the ability to reduce his pace but still deliver the ball in areas where batters couldn't score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:50:00">[31:50:00]</a>.
*   **Glenn McGrath**: Bumrah's wrist usage is compared to Glenn McGrath, who used his wrist to snap down the back of the ball. However, Bumrah and Mustafizur Rahman represent the "next evolution of fast bowling," incorporating spin bowler skills, possibly influenced by rubber ball bowling in Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:50:00">[34:50:00]</a>.
*   **Fred Spofforth & Sydney Barnes**: This blend of pace and spin-like skills harks back to early bowlers like Fred Spofforth and Sydney Barnes, blurring the lines between spin and pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:37:00">[35:37:00]</a>.
*   **Pat Brown, Dwayne Bravo, Harshal Patel, Andrew Tye**: Examples of modern bowlers bringing in separate skills (like off-spin at pace) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:11:00">[36:11:00]</a>.

Bumrah possesses all the skills of a traditional fast bowler (seam, wobble, reverse, some swing) and combines them with skills usually associated with spinners, like setting up batters with variations and lines similar to an off-spinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:32:00">[36:32:00]</a>. This makes him a "disruptor" who is helping the game evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:50:00">[38:50:00]</a>.

## Best All-Format Cricketer?

Jasprit Bumrah is arguably the best contemporary all-format cricketer, especially considering his status as the world's best T20 player as a bowler, despite only bowling 24 balls per game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:59:00">[39:59:00]</a>.

*   **[[comparison_of_fast_bowlers_in_indian_cricket | Pat Cummins]]**: While Cummins and Bumrah are close in Test cricket, Bumrah is "so much better in white ball cricket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:02:00">[43:02:00]</a>.
*   **Glenn McGrath**: Bumrah is considered better than even Peak Glenn McGrath across all formats, due to his extra pace and ability to get wickets without wearing batters out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:06:00">[44:06:00]</a>. He combines McGrath's accuracy with the pace of Mitchell Starc in one package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:24:00">[44:24:00]</a>.
*   **Travis Head**: Another contender for the best contemporary all-format cricketer, especially after his success in Tests and important limited-overs knocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:48:00">[42:48:00]</a>.
*   **Kagiso Rabada**: Mentioned as a former contender for the best all-format bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:41:00">[44:41:00]</a>.

Bumrah's unmatched dominance across all three formats with the ball is a level unseen before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:15:00">[41:15:00]</a>. His special qualities place him among the top all-format bowlers of all time, and if he achieves sustained longevity, he could become one of the greatest seam bowlers in Test cricket history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:33:00">[41:33:00]</a>. He is already considered India's best-ever bowler in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:33:00">[42:33:00]</a>.

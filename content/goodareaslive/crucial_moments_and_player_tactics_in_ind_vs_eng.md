## Overview of the Match

The match saw significant swings in momentum, with both teams holding dominant positions at different points [00:02:49]. At lunch on Day 1, England appeared unlikely to win [00:03:34], and by drinks in the last session on Day 2, India seemed unable to win [00:03:52]. However, by stumps on Day 3, England's chances of victory were gone [00:02:45]. The game has been described as a "wildly swung incredible game" [00:44:16].

## Pitch Conditions

The wicket throughout the match was challenging and, at times, "weird" [00:06:04]. Early in the game, the ball sometimes kept low [00:01:11], and despite cracks appearing to be "glued back together" by Day 3 [00:01:20], they remained a factor [00:03:30]. However, the cracks weren't always in an ideal spot for seamers to attack the stumps [00:32:21], [00:32:59]. The middle part of the day, especially when the sun was out, significantly influenced the wicket's behavior [00:03:49]. The pitch did not consistently aid low bounce, with some balls surprisingly rising [00:06:17].

## Key Player Performances and Tactics

### Ashwin's Impact

Concerns about Ashwin's age and effectiveness prior to the match were dispelled by his "absolutely outstanding" performance [00:06:38], [00:07:11]. He showed no "massive signs" of age catching up to him, especially after a strong finish in the third Test [00:06:40]. Ashwin proved to be a "fantastic new ball bowler" [00:08:53], utilizing his ability to skid the ball through and exploit inconsistent bounce [00:08:21], [00:08:48]. He took wickets by bowling straight, not relying on cracks or significant spin [00:01:30], [00:01:32], and became a "second Innings new ball destroyer" [00:01:36]. His average against left-handers with the new ball in India over the last five years is 16 [00:07:56]. Ashwin also leverages his skills more effectively in the third innings when taking the new ball [00:08:09]. His current bowling average of 38 before this match had led to talk about him being "too old" or "not looking effective" [01:00:35].

### Kuldeep Yadav's Role

Kuldeep Yadav's career has seen him bowl "pretty consistently around this... 15 to 16 over mark" [00:14:51]. While his figures can look very good, the team's strategy, especially with five bowlers, often means someone will be under-bowled [00:13:48]. He is used when there's a top-order batter who struggles against him, or during flat moments requiring a change-up, and against the tail [00:15:03]. His economy rate has improved, which is "really impressive" and has "never seen this from him before" [00:16:22]. Kuldeep has maintained a remarkably flat bowling average throughout his 11 Test matches, demonstrating consistency as a wicket-taker despite periods of low confidence [00:16:50]. His intelligence as a bowler was highlighted by his setup for Zak Crawley's dismissal [00:25:16].

### Zak Crawley's Batting

Zak Crawley's batting showed "real growth" [00:20:32]. He played 91% of his shots on the front foot and 9.9% on the back foot [00:20:29]. His main skill is staying in the crease and reaching balls to put pressure on bowlers [00:20:42]. He successfully turned good deliveries from Ashwin into "half follies," demonstrating effective counter-pressure [00:20:50]. Despite his impressive play, his overall Test average remains low (32.46) due to a lack of big scores and converting starts [00:21:31], [00:22:50]. His dismissal was a result of Kuldeep Yadav's "really clever bowling," playing off the back foot to a ball he perhaps shouldn't have [00:24:55].

### Ben Stokes' Dismissals

Ben Stokes' dismissals were attributed to his struggle to come forward defensively [00:34:16]. The ball that dismissed him in the second innings, which pitched outside leg stump, spun significantly, and kept low, was described as a "ridiculous ball" [00:34:40]. His method against spinners often involves playing very late and under his eyes, which has worked for him but is a "flawed" approach, especially when the ball spins away from him in Asia [00:36:34].

### Ollie Pope's Struggles

After a strong innings in Hyderabad with 59 false shots and one dismissal [00:26:11], Ollie Pope had 33 false shots and six dismissals in his next six innings [00:26:22]. His problem is that many of his mistakes occur early in his innings when he is not set, leading to dismissals when attacking fields are in place [00:26:53]. His dismissal to Ashwin was on an "essentially a straight ball that hit the center of the wicket," highlighting his poor position [00:27:41].

### Dhruv Jurel's Professionalism

Dhruv Jurel impressed with his straight batting on a wicket where the ball kept low [00:01:05], [00:28:00]. He played "right Cricket shots" when attacking, putting himself in a strong position [00:28:54]. Despite a missed stumping chance [00:29:13], his wicketkeeping was tidy, including an "exceptional" catch off Jimmy Anderson [00:29:20]. His play showed maturity beyond his age, demonstrating a strong understanding of his game [00:29:41].

## Team Strategies and Decisions

### India's Bowling Strategy

India's captain, Rohit Sharma, is suggested to have "over-bowled his new ball bowlers" at times, particularly against Zak Crawley [00:10:13]. Despite Ashwin's strong match-up against Duckett, India hasn't consistently given him the new ball in this series [00:09:31], perhaps due to Crawley being at the other end, who is weaker against spin and might be better targeted by left-arm finger spinners [00:09:57]. The combination of Ashwin and Kuldeep Yadav is considered a "really good combination" for India [00:58:49].

### England's "Bazball" Approach

England's "Bazball" approach has been a subject of debate. While it led to a victory in the first Test on a spinning track [00:54:21] and kept them in contention in other matches, it relies heavily on the short ball to manufacture wickets, which is less effective on Indian pitches [00:54:43]. England's batting, though still flawed, has improved from being "literally the worst batting team in the world for ages" before "Bazball" [01:00:17]. The method has allowed them to stay "within touch of winning three of the four matches" despite technical flaws [01:01:05].

### DRS Controversies

There has been dissatisfaction with the Decision Review System (DRS) from both Indian and English fans, leading to accusations of "unfairness" [00:42:46]. The accuracy of Hawkeye's predictive element for very full balls that hit the pad is questioned, as "the fuller the ball is... the more predictive" it becomes [00:40:11]. The commentator notes a feeling that Hawkeye's tracking has been "more random" in the last year or so, including during this series [00:42:10].

## Turning Points and Momentum Swings

The match has been characterized by significant swings in momentum. England's position after scoring well by tea on Day 3, despite losing three wickets [00:01:44], quickly deteriorated. After tea, England's performance was described as "bad," "horri," and "really bad" [00:02:03]. A sequence of poor shots, including Jonny Bairstow pushing hard at the first ball and getting caught at short cover [00:02:09], and Ben Foakes not scoring for a long period [00:02:12], contributed to their collapse. The delivery of "a metric ton of full tosses and half follies" by England's opening bowlers made it difficult for them to defend even a "decent total" of 180 runs [00:02:18]. This led to a stark reversal from being "nearly unback favourites to lose a match" [00:02:28]. England's collapse of six or seven wickets for 35 runs was considered a "really bad collapse," not solely due to the pitch [00:48:50], [00:49:19]. The match's outcome now heavily favors India, with England needing a "fourth or the fifth major turnaround" to win [00:46:32].

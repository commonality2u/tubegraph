This article explores the contrasting performances of [[Shubman Gills Batting Performance in Different Innings | Shubman Gill]] and Cheteshwar Pujara across different cricketing conditions, highlighting the unique challenges and strategies associated with batting in various environments.

## Shubman Gill's Performance Across Venues

[[Shubman Gills Batting Performance in Different Innings | Shubman Gill]] has shown varied batting performances depending on the venue and conditions:
*   He has performed "very, very well in Australia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:44:03">[21:44:03]</a>, suggesting a suitability for harder, faster wickets.
*   His performance in [[challenges_facing_batsmen_on_indian_pitches | India]] has "not not really being particularly good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:46:27">[21:46:27]</a>.
*   He has "really struggled" when the ball has been "moving laterally" in seam bowling conditions, such as in England and South Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:07:07">[22:07:07]</a>.
*   His performance in West Indies was "okay" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:52:19">[21:52:19]</a>, and in Bangladesh it was also "okay" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:56:06">[21:56:06]</a>.

### Batting Style and Development
There's an observation that [[Shubman Gills batting techniques against different bowlers | Shubman Gill]] tends to struggle with strike rotation in Test cricket, contrasting with his strong performance in One Day International (ODI) and T20 formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:37:04">[36:37:04]</a>. It is also noted that he appears to be "looking for boundaries rather than just the simple thing of I should get to the other end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:55:00">[36:55:00]</a>.

Suggestions for his development include:
*   Potentially utilizing players like Gill where their strengths are, while developing their weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:27:09">[22:27:09]</a>.
*   Moving him down the batting order to ease pressure, similar to how young Virat Kohli or Ricky Ponting were brought into Test cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:32:00">[23:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:22:00">[24:22:00]</a>. This approach aims to build confidence for talented players rather than "ruin their confidence or anything like that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:12:00">[25:12:00]</a>.

## Cheteshwar Pujara's Experience

Cheteshwar Pujara, along with Ajinkya Rahane, is highlighted as an experienced batter who "kind of know what to do" and are "very experienced in many different conditions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:48:00">[47:48:00]</a>. Their experience contrasts with younger players in the Indian batting order who "haven't quite proven themselves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:45:00">[47:45:00]</a>.

The discussion around Pujara's dropping from the team is contextualized by the prevailing [[cricket_pitch_conditions_and_their_impact_on_matches | pitch conditions]] in [[challenges_facing_batsmen_on_indian_pitches | India]] at the time, which were often "really dominated by the bowlers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:50:00">[24:50:00]</a>. This environment made it difficult for any incoming player to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:46:00">[24:46:00]</a>.

## Overall Batting Challenges

The current Test cricket landscape makes it "hard to make runs... anywhere in the world at the moment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:11:00">[47:11:00]</a>, with the "wobble ball" also posing challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:01:00">[25:01:00]</a>. This context is important when evaluating the performances of younger players like Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal, who are trying to "make their mark and feel confident" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:24:00">[47:24:00]</a>.

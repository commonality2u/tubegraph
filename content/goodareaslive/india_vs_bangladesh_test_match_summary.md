India secured another home Test victory against Bangladesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The final margin saw Bangladesh losing by 280 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

## Bangladesh's Performance Analysis

Despite the loss, Bangladesh's performance prompted a mixed reaction, with the team likely feeling "pissed" because only one of their three strong suits functioned as desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### Batting

Bangladesh's top order struggled, often described as a "hope situation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Their middle order (batters 5-8), including all-rounders, is typically where they expect to make runs on the wicket, but this aspect "completely fell apart" in this match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

Bangladesh batters' control percentage was inconsistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. While the top three showed "okay" control around the 80% mark, performance significantly declined for the rest of the lineup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. No middle-order batter could "stick in for any particular amount of time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

**Notable Batting Performances:**
*   **Shanto:** Scored 82 runs, demonstrating maturity in a difficult innings, despite batting with the tail and likely chasing a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. Many of his dismissals were off Ashwin, hitting against the spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Shanto's innings highlight his ongoing development as a player, especially given his challenging start to Test cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

The team's batting partnerships were problematic; after two initial "okay" partnerships, they failed to build anything substantial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

### Bowling

Bangladesh's all-rounders, Mahedi Hasan and Shakib Al Hasan, were expected to perform better but only took three wickets combined and scored less than 32 runs each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Mahedi Hasan's bowling pace is similar to Ashwin's, but he lacks Ashwin's variety in pace, possessing only a standard and a slower ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. Shakib also has a normal and a slightly faster ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

Conversely, Bangladesh's fast bowlers performed well, "knocking the head off the Indian top order twice," fulfilling their role in the given conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. The Bangladesh seamers had an average of 27.81 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

## India's Performance

India's victory was significant, and they could have extended their lead further if they chose to bat on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

### Bowling

The Indian spin duo of Ashwin and Jadeja were highly effective, contributing significantly to both runs scored and wickets taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. They accounted for approximately 53% of the total counting stats (runs and wickets combined) in the match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.

*   **Spin Comparison:** Both Jadeja and Ashwin spin the ball in different directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. Jadeja consistently spins the ball at a similar amount, while Ashwin shows a greater range in turn, reaching over four degrees of turn towards the end of the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
*   **Pace Variation:** Jadeja's top pace is around 93.5 km/h, with a slightly quicker ball and a slower delivery around 89 km/h <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. Ashwin bowls a variety of paces, with his main pace around 85-86 km/h, but he can reach 95-96 km/h <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. This gives both Indian spinners "three different modes" compared to the "two-dimensional" Bangladeshi spinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.
*   **Ashwin's Consistency:** Ashwin bowls to left-handers by consistently landing the ball in the same spot, while against right-handers, his deliveries are more variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

India's lower-middle order also made significant runs and took wickets, a stark contrast to Bangladesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. The Indian seamers were highly effective, averaging 17.6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

### Fourth Innings Context

Historically, it is difficult to score many runs in the fourth innings at Chepauk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. Bangladesh's score of 168 was the third-highest in the fourth innings at the venue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. This suggests that despite the loss, there were positive signs for Bangladesh, particularly their fourth-innings runs and the performance of their seam bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

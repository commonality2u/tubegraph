Glenn Maxwell delivered an "absolutely remarkable" innings against Afghanistan in the ICC Men's ODI World Cup 2023, widely considered one of the greatest one-day innings ever played <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. This performance was not merely a victory for Australia but was framed as a personal triumph for Maxwell, who single-handedly steered his team to an improbable win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

## Match Context and Australia's Collapse

Afghanistan batted first, making nearly 300 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>. Their strategy was to take many wickets with spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>, but it was their fast bowlers who started exceptionally well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. Afghanistan secured early breakthroughs with Naveen-ul-Haq taking two crucial wickets, including Travis Head with a magnificent angling delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>, and Mitchell Marsh attempting aggressive shots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. Omarzai also delivered an impressive inswinging ball to dismiss David Warner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.

Australia's chase began disastrously, finding themselves at 91 for 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. This left Maxwell, who had been dealing with injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>, at the crease alongside captain Pat Cummins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

## Maxwell's Physical Battle and Unconventional Brilliance

Maxwell's innings was defined by immense physical hardship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. He fought through severe cramps, being "reduced to little more than a knarled elf that had been tossed in a fire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. He could barely run between wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>, often resembling "Charlie Chaplin on 12 frames" when attempting to move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. Despite this, he continuously hit boundaries in "weird and wild ways" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

His batting form was highly unconventional, with a "power stance of someone who's just been taught what a power stance is and their body is not quite working" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>. As his body deteriorated, he relied almost entirely on his hands to generate power, resembling "Thing from The Addams Family" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>.

Early in his innings, Maxwell survived a DRS call where the ball bounced over the stumps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>, and he was also dropped multiple times by Afghanistan's fielders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>. This luck, combined with his sheer determination, allowed him to capitalize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>.

Pat Cummins, at the other end, contributed only 12 runs to their partnership, but batted for an hour longer than he ever had in an ODI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:42:00">[17:42:00]</a>, playing the role of a "world's most overpaid cheerleader" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. His main objective was to remain not out, allowing Maxwell to stay on strike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.

## [[historical_comparison_of_glenn_maxwells_innings_to_other_legendary_cricket_innings | Historical Comparisons]]

The innings immediately sparked debate about its place among the greatest in cricket history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. Key comparisons included:
*   **Chris Gayle's 237 and AB de Villiers' 160-odd against West Indies**: Maxwell's innings is considered superior due to the physical challenges, wickets fallen, and the chasing scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:32:00">[19:32:00]</a>.
*   **World Cup Final Innings**: While innings by players like Ben Stokes (2019), Adam Gilchrist (2003, 2007), Aravinda de Silva (1996), and Clive Lloyd (1975) were under immense pressure in finals, none were made in such a dire physical or wicket situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:01:00">[20:01:00]</a>.
*   **Kapil Dev's 175* vs Zimbabwe (1983)**: This innings, which no one saw, involved a similar collapse (17 for 5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:30:00">[21:30:00]</a>. However, it was a first innings score, allowing for more freedom, and against a team not as strong as Afghanistan's current bowling attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:59:00">[21:59:00]</a>.
*   **Kevin O'Brien's 113 vs England (2011)**: This is considered pound-for-pound the most surprising innings in world cricket, as an associate nation chased a huge total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:10:00">[22:10:00]</a>. O'Brien, however, had more support from other batsmen than Maxwell did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:26:00">[22:26:00]</a>.
*   **Sachin Tendulkar's first ODI 200**: While breaking the 200 barrier was significant, Maxwell's innings had more contextual difficulty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:18:00">[23:18:00]</a>.
*   **Sanath Jayasuriya's 189**: Made when his team was 16 for 4, this was a phenomenal innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:40:00">[23:40:00]</a>.
*   **Herschelle Gibbs' 175 in the record run chase**: A marvelous innings but lacked the physical and wicket-loss context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:52:00">[23:52:00]</a>.
*   **Viv Richards' 189* (1984)**: This innings came at a time when such a score in ODI cricket was almost unheard of, with Richards scoring 106 runs for the last wicket with Michael Holding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:17:00">[24:17:17]</a>. The key differences are that Richards was not chasing, and Maxwell's physical state was unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:06:00">[25:06:00]</a>.

Ultimately, few, if any, innings in ODI history surpass Maxwell's due to the combination of the chase, the number of wickets lost, the one-sided partnership, and the profound physical toll on the player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:36:00">[25:36:00]</a>. The fact that he had to physically change his batting approach due to injury makes it stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:53:00">[25:53:00]</a>.

## [[maxwells_reputation_in_indian_cricket | Maxwell's Career and World Cup Form]]

Maxwell has had a "weird career" where Australia tried to "put a leash on something that you can't actually train up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>. Unlike Andrew Symonds, who was reined in by Australian coaches, Maxwell's success in T20 cricket overseas allowed him to escape this muzzle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>. Pat Cummins acknowledged that "you don't tell him anything" to get the best out of him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>.

In World Cups, Maxwell has consistently elevated his game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:55:00">[16:55:00]</a>. His strike rate in World Cup cricket, even before this innings, was "absolutely extraordinary," averaging 50 with a strike rate of 161 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[14:26:00]</a>. This is significantly higher than other power hitters like Jos Buttler and David Miller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:20:00">[13:20:00]</a>. He now has three ODI hundreds in World Cups and one outside of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:48:00">[16:48:00]</a>.

## Afghanistan's Performance and Missed Opportunities

Afghanistan's bowlers started exceptionally well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. Naveen-ul-Haq and Azmatullah Omarzai delivered high-quality seam bowling, taking early wickets and putting Australia under immense pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. Their strategy of playing an extra spinner was initially effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:17:00">[33:17:00]</a>.

Despite their strong start, Afghanistan's fielding errors, including multiple dropped catches of Maxwell, proved costly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:20:00">[52:20:00]</a>. Tactically, questions were raised about not bowling more wide Yorkers or short-pitched deliveries to Maxwell when he was physically compromised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:54:00">[45:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:46:00">[49:46:00]</a>. The team was described as "shell shocked" by Maxwell's onslaught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:32:00">[47:32:00]</a>.

Ibrahim Zadran scored Afghanistan's first-ever World Cup century, a "classy innings" that should have been the main story if Afghanistan had won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:32:00">[38:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:50:00">[40:50:50]</a>. His composed batting provided a strong foundation for Afghanistan's total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:36:00">[38:36:00]</a>.

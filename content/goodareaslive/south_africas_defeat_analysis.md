South Africa's Defeat in the Champions Trophy Semifinal
South Africa was defeated by New Zealand by 50 runs in the Champions Trophy semi-final held in Lahore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. This loss meant New Zealand advanced to the final against India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

## Match Overview
South Africa was comprehensively outplayed in multiple facets of the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. Despite starting as slight favorites, they were never truly in control of the match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>, and there was no period where they were on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

## Toss and Pitch Conditions
New Zealand captain Mitchell Santner won the toss and opted to bat first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. South Africa's captain, Temba Bavuma, also expressed a desire to bat first, which was not surprising given South Africa's preference to bat first and their historical skepticism when chasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. The pitch was described as an "absolute belter" and a "road" for batting, making it conducive for high scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. New Zealand posted an "above par" total of 362 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>, with some suggesting it was 20 runs too many for the conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.

## Batting Performance Analysis
### Top Order Struggles
The most critical aspect of the game was seen as the clash between South Africa's top order and New Zealand's new ball bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. Temba Bavuma, the captain, was overly focused on surviving the new ball phase and "forgot that you also have to score runs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. He got stuck, starting with 3 runs off 18 balls and eventually reaching 56 off 71 deliveries, consistently falling behind the required run rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>. He was also dropped on 50 by Kane Williamson, a chance he failed to capitalize on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

While Rassie van der Dussen and Bavuma had a partnership around the 20th over, they were only at parity with the required rate, never truly on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. Ryan Rickelton, who looked set to score quickly (120 off 80 balls), was dismissed early by a "fluke wicket" that stopped on him, pushing it to short cover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. This early loss, combined with the slow start, made catching up impossible as they didn't have enough wickets in hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.

### David Miller's Effort
David Miller was left stranded with an unbeaten 100 off 67 deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:22:00">[19:22:00]</a>. This innings was seen as summing up his career, where he often performs well in knockout games but his team fails around him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:28:00">[19:28:00]</a>. Examples include his 49 off 18 in 2015, a century in the 2023 ODI World Cup semifinal, and a catch in the T20 World Cup final that prevented him from winning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:03:00">[19:03:00]</a>. Despite his efforts, the team lost too many wickets in the middle, making a chase impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:15:00">[21:15:00]</a>.

## Bowling Performance Analysis
South Africa's bowling performance was considered one of their worst recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:45:00">[53:45:00]</a>.
*   **Lungi Ngidi** was the best bowler for South Africa, taking 3 wickets for 72 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:56:00">[52:56:00]</a>. All his wickets came from slower deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:56:00">[52:56:00]</a>.
*   **Keshav Maharaj** went wicketless and was taken on by Kane Williamson and Rachin Ravindra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:00:00">[53:00:00]</a>.
*   **Kagiso Rabada** bowled at first change, took two wickets, but wasn't as threatening as usual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:17:00">[53:17:00]</a>.
*   **Marco Jansen** had a terrible day, conceding 79 runs without a wicket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:25:00">[53:25:00]</a>. He bowled too many short or leg-side deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:30:00">[53:30:00]</a> and was "butchered" by Glenn Phillips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:27:00">[53:27:00]</a>.

## Fielding and Other Factors
South Africa, despite being one of the two best fielding sides in the tournament, dropped two crucial catches in this game: Heinrich Klaasen dropped Kane Williamson on 56, and Daryl Mitchell was dropped on 39 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:36:00">[43:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:05:00">[48:05:00]</a>. New Zealand's catch success rate in the tournament is 96%, highlighting South Africa's comparative lapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:25:00">[54:25:00]</a>.

The commentators questioned whether excessive travel and fatigue contributed to South Africa's defeat, a point raised by David Miller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:54:00">[31:54:00]</a>. However, this was somewhat dismissed as New Zealand also traveled at odd hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:11:00">[32:11:00]</a>. Ultimately, South Africa was out-bowled, out-fielded, and out-batted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:58:00">[53:58:00]</a>.

## Comparison to Other Teams
[[South Africas performance in the T20 World Cup|South Africa's performance in the T20 World Cup]] and their general form have been noted as strong, despite their tendency to falter in major tournaments. Comparing them to other teams in other sports, such as Tottenham Hotspurs in football or the Clippers in basketball, draws parallels with teams that are good but struggle to win major titles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:00">[12:15:00]</a>. The team is seen as a "very good side who then don't win major things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>.

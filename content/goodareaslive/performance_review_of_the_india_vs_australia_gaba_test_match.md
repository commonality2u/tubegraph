From: [[goodareaslive]] <br/> 

The Gaba Test match between [[india_vs_australia_test_cricket_analysis | India]] and [[australia_vs_india_4th_test_match_analysis | Australia]] concluded in a draw due to incessant rain in Brisbane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>. The series remains level at 1-1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.

## Implications for World Test Championship

Following the draw, [[india_vs_australia_test_cricket_analysis | India]] now needs to win both remaining Test matches to qualify for the World Test Championship final <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. If they win one and lose one, permutations involving the Sri Lanka series will be considered. Winning both would make [[india_vs_australia_test_cricket_analysis | India]] quite safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>.

## Shock Retirement: Ravichandran Ashwin

Veteran spinner Ravichandran Ashwin announced his retirement mid-series from international cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This decision suggests he was likely communicated that he wasn't in [[india_vs_australia_test_cricket_analysis | India]]'s plans for the upcoming SCG match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Spinners have averaged 52 at the SCG in the last four years, indicating a very different wicket from previous years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

It appears to have been a mutual, "grown-up decision" between Ashwin and Indian cricket management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Given he would be around 39 when [[india_vs_australia_test_cricket_analysis | India]] next plays home Tests, waiting for that period might have been too long for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. [[india_vs_australia_test_cricket_analysis | India]] also possesses a strong stock of spinners, including Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel (Jadeja's backup), and Kuldeep Yadav <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

Ashwin's career statistics include:
*   106 Test matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>
*   537 wickets at an average of 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>
*   37 five-wicket hauls (tied for second most with Shane Warne) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>
*   8 ten-wicket hauls (fifth most, level with Anil Kumble) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>
*   Bowling average of 28 in England and 42 in [[australia_vs_india_4th_test_match_analysis | Australia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>
*   353 runs at an average of 25.75, with six centuries and 14 half-centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>
*   Equally effective against right-handed (269 dismissals) and left-handed (268 dismissals) batters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>

Ashwin is considered a "proper nerd" with intelligence and wit, leaving a "killer legacy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. His decision was respected, even if fans would have liked a farewell Test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. He is predicted to have a solid career in media due to his deep thinking about the sport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

## Match Performance Review

### Australia's Batting [[batting_performance_analysis_of_india_and_australia | Performance]]

*   **Steve Smith:** Scored a Test century after a year and a half, reaching 101 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>. His innings had two halves; he started by "imitating himself" before finding his flow as the ball softened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>.
*   **Travis Head:** Dominated with 152 off 160 deliveries, continuing his excellent form with back-to-back centuries and Player of the Match awards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a>. He appears to love playing against [[india_vs_australia_test_cricket_analysis | India]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:25">[00:47:25]</a>.

### India's Batting [[batting_performance_analysis_of_india_and_australia | Performance]]

*   **KL Rahul:** Was [[india_vs_australia_test_cricket_analysis | India]]'s highest scorer in the series with 84 runs, batting at the top of the order in difficult conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>. He is considered [[india_vs_australia_test_cricket_analysis | India]]'s best overseas batter in Test cricket for the last couple of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:22">[00:35:22]</a>.
*   **Ravindra Jadeja:** Scored 77 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:25">[00:37:25]</a>. While his score was significant, it was achieved in easier conditions, not having to face the new ball like top-order batters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:28">[00:37:28]</a>.
*   **Akash Deep & Jasprit Bumrah Partnership:** Their partnership at the end helped [[india_vs_australia_test_cricket_analysis | India]] avoid the follow-on, effectively drawing the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:44">[00:39:44]</a>.

### Bowling [[indias_bowling_performance_in_the_test | Performance]]

*   **Jasprit Bumrah:** Had figures of 6 for 76 in the first innings and 3 for 18 in the third <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:59">[00:50:59]</a>. He now has 21 wickets in the series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:06">[00:51:06]</a>. Despite concerns about his workload (bowling 28 overs in the first innings and 25 of 100 overs for [[australia_vs_india_4th_test_match_analysis | Australia]]'s innings), his overall series workload is comparable to other frontline pacers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:32">[00:51:32]</a>. He is 6 wickets away from 200 Test wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:38">[00:59:38]</a>.
*   **Mohammed Siraj:** Has taken 13 wickets at an average of 24 in the series, with figures similar to Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:53">[00:53:53]</a>. He is seen as a "villain" figure, embracing the boos from Australian crowds, drawing comparisons to Stuart Broad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:02">[00:54:02]</a>.
*   **Pat Cummins:** Achieved figures of 4 for 81, showcasing his ability to bowl nagging lengths and effectively use the short ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:45">[00:56:45]</a>.
*   **Mitchell Starc:** Continues to take new ball wickets, which is his most potent phase, with figures of 3 for 83 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:56">[00:56:56]</a>.

## Areas of Concern

### India's Batting Struggles

*   **Rohit Sharma:** His form is a concern, as he has scored only 19 runs in the series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:22">[00:31:22]</a>. His batting position (at six) is debated, but his lack of runs is the primary issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>.
*   **Virat Kohli:** His average is 26 in the last 5 years (excluding his 3 centuries) and 8 in the first innings of his last 10 Tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>. Despite his struggles, his legacy and the unlikelihood of finding a replacement talent mean he retains his spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>.
*   **Yashasvi Jaiswal:** Was dismissed early in the Gaba Test (second ball of the game) against Mitchell Starc, a repeat of his pink-ball dismissal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:24">[00:34:24]</a>. While he scored 161 in one innings, he needs to improve consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a>.

### Australia's Batting Struggles

*   **Usman Khawaja and Matthew Kuhnemann:** Both are struggling for form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:44">[00:46:44]</a>.
*   **Marnus Labuschagne:** While he had a knock of 64, he hasn't looked particularly convincing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:55">[00:46:55]</a>.
*   **Matthew Renshaw:** His scoring rate is a major concern; he looks like a Test player who will have a strike rate of around 36, which is difficult to sustain unless one has an exceptional forward defense like Pujara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:28">[00:49:28]</a>.

## Tactical Discussions

*   **India's Toss Decision:** Rohit Sharma's decision to bowl first at the Gaba, despite initial criticism, was not considered wrong by experts as it was a new ball wicket offering purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. The wicket conditions have changed significantly over time, making older narratives about the Gaba pitch irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>.
*   **Australia's Declaration:** The discussion around Australia's declaration timing suggests that an earlier declaration (perhaps on Day 2 when Travis Head went out) could have given them more time, but there were risks involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:31">[00:43:31]</a>. Hindsight plays a significant role in such analyses, as the weather forecast was not known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:34">[00:43:34]</a>.

## Injuries and Replacements

*   **Josh Hazlewood:** Is out for the remainder of the series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:56">[00:59:56]</a>. Scotty Boland is expected to provide support to Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc. While Boland is a downgrade from Hazelwood, he performed well in the last Test with five wickets at 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:10">[00:57:10]</a>.
*   **Mohammed Shami:** Is not expected to return for the remainder of the series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.
*   **Travis Head:** Has a groin injury concern, though he stated he is fine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:43">[00:48:43]</a>.

## Series Outlook

The series is in a "really exciting position" with both teams being "fairly evenly matched" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>. There are weaknesses and strengths in both sides, with some players in form and others not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. The next Test, the Boxing Day Test at the MCG, is expected to be decisive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:52">[00:50:52]</a>.

It is predicted that [[australia_vs_india_4th_test_match_analysis | Australia]] is more likely to win in Melbourne (where seam bowling will matter more), and [[india_vs_australia_test_cricket_analysis | India]] is more likely to win in Sydney (where batting will matter more) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:34">[01:00:34]</a>.

[[australia_vs_india_4th_test_match_analysis | Australia]] hasn't defeated [[india_vs_australia_test_cricket_analysis | India]] in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>. [[india_vs_australia_test_cricket_analysis | India]] has a chance to create history with a third consecutive series win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>.

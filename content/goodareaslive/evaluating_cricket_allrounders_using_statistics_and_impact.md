From: [[goodareaslive]] <br/> 

The Crick Picks podcast, in its 20th episode, conducted a snake-style draft to determine the top five all-time Test all-rounders in cricket history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>. The discussion highlighted various [[methods_of_evaluating_cricket_players | methods of evaluating cricket players]], balancing traditional [[understanding_cricket_statistics | cricket statistics]] with intangible factors like impact, athleticism, and role within the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>.

## Key Evaluation Criteria

The hosts, Bam Kazi, Estelle Vasu, and Jared Kimber, employed several criteria for [[cricketing_roles_and_player_performance_assessment | player performance assessment]] when [[assessing_the_performance_and_style_of_specific_cricket_players | assessing Test all-rounders]]:

*   **Statistical Performance:** Batting and bowling averages, wickets, runs, centuries, five-wicket hauls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. The "average differential" (difference between batting and bowling average) was frequently cited as a key metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.
*   **Role and Contribution:** Whether a player was a primary bowler or batter, or capable of both at a high level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:09">[02:39:09]</a>. This includes roles like opening the bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a> or batting in the top order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.
*   **Impact and "Clutch" Factor:** Ability to influence game outcomes, especially in pressure situations, often transcending raw statistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. This aligns with the concept of [[impactful_cricketers_with_average_statistics | impactful cricketers with average statistics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.
*   **Athleticism and Longevity:** The physical capacity to maintain high performance across multiple roles and a long career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.
*   **Influence beyond the field:** Cultural impact or mentorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

The discussion highlighted the complexity of [[evaluating_current_cricket_players_across_formats | evaluating current cricket players across formats]] and historical figures, showing that while [[analyzing_cricket_data | analyzing cricket data]] provides a foundation, the [[cricket_and_player_performances | cricket and player performances]] also rely heavily on impact, adaptability, and athleticism. The emphasis on "freakishly athletic people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:18">[01:15:18]</a> among top all-rounders underscores the demanding nature of the [[role_and_impact_of_allrounders_in_test_cricket_teams | all-rounder's role]] in Test cricket.

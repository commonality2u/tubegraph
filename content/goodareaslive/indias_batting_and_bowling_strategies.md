India demonstrated strong strategic play in a recent Test match, particularly excelling in both batting and bowling departments against Australia.

## Batting Performance and Strategy

India's batting was highlighted by significant contributions from young opener Yashasvi Jaiswal and experienced batter Virat Kohli.

### Yashasvi Jaiswal's Dominance
Yashasvi Jaiswal showcased exceptional form, refusing to score "normal 100s" and consistently converting his centuries into "daddy hundreds" [0:01:00]. This trait appears to be ingrained from the start of his first-class career, where coaches' messages about batting on and maximizing runs seem to have fully sunk in [0:05:00] [0:05:08] [0:05:25] [0:05:27] [0:05:51] [0:05:54].

Jaiswal's statistical breakdown reveals his strengths:
*   He averages 72 when the ball arrives on a straight line [0:07:32].
*   His average drops to 29 when the ball has an angle or is wide [0:07:37] [0:07:40].
*   He is particularly strong against length bowling, boasting a "ridiculous average" in that area [0:08:08] [0:08:12].
*   His ability to "strike rotate" and consistently put pressure on the opposition is considered his best skill, with an average of over 100 in Test cricket when rotating strike [0:08:27] [0:08:44] [0:08:49] [0:08:55]. This average is more than double that of other openers in the last three years [0:09:11]. This consistent scoring without needing to play big shots might be a reason why Rohit Sharma occasionally gets upset when Jaiswal plays overly aggressive shots [0:09:29] [0:09:31].

### Virat Kohli's Resurgence
Virat Kohli, initially struggling, appeared much more settled at the crease in the second innings, striking the ball with ease and resembling his peak form [0:01:11] [0:01:19] [0:01:20] [0:09:50] [0:09:53] [0:10:01]. He made a strategic adjustment from batting on off stump to leg stump, which was seen as a much better decision for him [0:10:06] [0:10:09].

Kohli's strong record in Australia is well-known, as he thrives when the ball comes onto the bat [0:10:13] [0:10:40] [0:10:41] [0:10:44]. He now ranks alongside legends like Wally Hammond for most centuries by away batters in Australia, with only Jack Hobbs ahead of them [0:10:50] [0:10:51] [0:10:55] [0:11:00]. His willingness to play a reverse sweep, a rare shot for him, and adopt a more team-oriented, malleable game demonstrates his adaptation to solve problems and score in different ways [0:11:48] [0:11:53] [0:12:03] [0:12:06] [0:12:15] [0:12:17] [0:12:20] [0:12:23] [0:12:37].

### KL Rahul's Contribution
[[Indias batting strategy and number four position discussion | KL Rahul]] played an important knock, laying a crucial platform in the second innings [0:00:48] [0:02:49] [0:02:59].

### Overall Batting Performance
India's ability to make a "big innings" is a traditional method to beat Australia in Australia, and they successfully executed this strategy [0:15:07] [0:15:10]. The team's collective brilliant cricket allowed them to exploit favorable conditions and put themselves in a strong position [0:22:56] [0:23:02] [0:23:03].

## Bowling Performance and Strategy

India's bowlers, particularly Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj, performed exceptionally, backing up the batting display.

### Jasprit Bumrah's Effectiveness
Jasprit Bumrah's bowling in Australia, particularly with the new ball within overs 1-20, is statistically his best performance compared to other countries [0:16:16] [0:16:18] [0:16:36] [0:16:45] [0:17:15]. He has shown a remarkable ability to work out the right length on Australian wickets [0:17:05] [0:17:12]. His early dismissal of a batter was a result of a well-planned setup, moving the ball away before delivering a straighter one that kept low [0:17:42] [0:17:46] [0:17:48] [0:17:51] [0:17:59] [0:18:30]. His career average is now sub-20, a "ridiculous record" for a bowler of his talent [0:17:16] [0:17:28] [0:32:17] [0:33:14].

### Mohammed Siraj's Contribution
Mohammed Siraj looks to be in a better rhythm, despite not bowling at his fastest pace [0:02:40] [0:02:40] [0:02:41] [0:02:42] [0:02:43] [0:24:00] [0:24:04] [0:24:08] [0:24:10] [0:24:44] [0:24:46] [0:24:49]. His good form, coupled with Bumrah's performance, makes India's bowling attack formidable, especially if Mohammed Shami returns [0:17:30] [0:23:59] [0:24:00] [0:24:07] [0:24:10] [0:24:43] [0:24:46] [0:24:49].

### General Bowling Approach
India's bowlers adjusted their length effectively, bowling fuller and more attacking lines, contrasting with Australia's shorter lengths [0:04:08] [0:04:11] [0:23:33] [0:23:36]. This tactical adaptation allowed them to exploit the pitch conditions more effectively [0:23:38] [0:23:40]. The overall bowling performance by India was better, especially with the new ball, which generated more inconsistent bounce [0:34:58] [0:35:02] [0:35:04] [0:35:07].

## Series Outlook

Despite initial low confidence and the absence of key players like [[Indias bowling strategy and selection in ODIs | Mohammed Shami]], India's performance has been exceptional [0:02:02] [0:21:47] [0:24:07] [0:24:08] [0:24:20]. Their perceived weaknesses have transformed into strengths [0:24:38]. While Australia's top four batting issues have been "massively exposed" [0:22:48] [0:22:50] [0:23:52] [0:24:34] [0:24:36], and their bowlers may not be consistently bowling short due to exertion concerns [0:26:47] [0:26:49] [0:26:51], India's ability to capitalize on conditions and play brilliant cricket has put them in a strong position for the series [0:22:54] [0:22:56] [0:25:03] [0:25:05].

However, the upcoming pink ball Test in Adelaide introduces an element of randomness, and Australia has a strong record in such matches [0:25:55] [0:25:57] [0:26:00] [0:26:03] [0:26:05] [0:27:26] [0:27:28] [0:30:11] [0:30:15] [0:30:19] [0:30:20]. A "form rebalance" is anticipated, with Australia likely to play better and India potentially not maintaining the same level of performance in the next match [0:55:02] [0:57:45] [0:57:47] [0:57:50].

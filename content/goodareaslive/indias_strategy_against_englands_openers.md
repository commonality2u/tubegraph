India's cricketing strategy against England's openers in recent matches, particularly on surfaces favoring spin and bounce, has involved a mix of aggressive seam bowling and patient spin, though not without its challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:26">[01:25:26]</a>.

## Early Bowling Performance

At the start of a day's play, [[indias_bowling_strategies_and_performance | India's bowling strategies]] have seen [[indias_bowling_strategies_and_performance | Jasprit Bumrah]] deliver "banana deliveries" that could humiliate top players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:58">[00:54:58]</a>. Despite England's Crawley playing almost exclusively with the outside or leading edge, and being nowhere near hitting the middle of the ball, Bumrah did not secure a wicket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>. England's willingness to punish errant deliveries meant that edges often fell into gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:37">[01:15:37]</a>. This period was noted as perhaps the "most grown-up Bazball opening partnership" seen for some time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:21">[01:20:21]</a>.

Despite the early pressure, [[indias_performance_and_strategies_in_Test_Cricket | India]] could have taken multiple wickets in the first session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:07">[01:31:07]</a>. However, England, having gained an advantage, subsequently "completely destroyed it on their own" through loose play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:40">[01:41:40]</a>.

## Spinners' Impact

[[indias_bowling_strategies_and_performance | Kuldeep Yadav]] bowled very smartly, with his 'wrongâ€™un' deliveries playing a significant role in several wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:27">[01:46:27]</a>. England's batters, including Ben Duckett and Pope, failed to pick his wrong'un, leading to dismissals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:59">[04:56:59]</a>. On surfaces with both spin and bounce, such as the one in Dharamshala, wrist spinners like Kuldeep thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:16">[03:52:16]</a>. He has been a constant threat throughout the series, though he has looked most effective against the tail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:02">[04:40:02]</a>.

Kuldeep's effectiveness also came from bowling slightly slower on pitches that assist wrist spin, allowing him to maintain his optimum pace (81 to 85 km/h) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:18">[09:31:18]</a>. His confidence has grown throughout the series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:32">[10:16:32]</a>.

## Openers' Approach and Challenges

England's openers, Zach Crawley and Ben Duckett, have been given the freedom to play aggressively, which has "completely revolutionized" their game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:14">[13:53:14]</a>. They average 42 in the series, significantly outperforming England's middle order (positions 3-7 average 25) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:17">[10:30:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:38:15">[12:38:15]</a>.

Despite their good starts, the question arises whether their mindset needs to change after reaching 30-40 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11:47">[14:11:47]</a>.

> "Once you get to 40, though, doesn't the mindset need to change a little bit... You've done the hard work, then you don't have to take the risks anymore." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:37">[14:15:37]</a>

Crawley, in particular, has shown improvement in playing spin, being able to block or play good shots when coming down the wicket, rather than always trying to smash the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:33:43">[19:33:43]</a>. However, he struggles to convert starts (30-70 runs) into larger scores, lacking the "milking gene" to accumulate runs once the field spreads out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:00:54">[23:00:54]</a>.

## Strategic Decisions and Outcomes

[[indias_bowling_strategy_and_player_rotation | India's decision to start with seamers]] like Jasprit Bumrah and Siraj, rather than spinners, has been a point of discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:52:03">[27:52:03]</a>. While Bumrah created numerous chances with swing, reverse swing, and seam movement, he often didn't get wickets, leading to moments of frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:21:40">[16:21:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26:00">[16:26:00]</a>. Siraj, meanwhile, bowled some good balls but was perceived by some to be bowling too short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:30:35">[16:30:35]</a>.

> "I think quite often with Bumrah, it's main bowler... today the ball was hooping around everywhere though... there's a couple of times when I thought the seamers were bowling really, really well and so why would you why would you not do it." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:45:15">[47:45:15]</a>

Ultimately, India's patience has paid off. Earlier in the series, they were shaken by England's aggressive style, but now they are patient, knowing England often self-destructs after good starts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:33">[02:07:33]</a>. This has led to England's middle order collapsing, despite the openers' improved performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:06">[02:11:06]</a>.

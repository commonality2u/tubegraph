[[Rohit Sharmas batting strategy and position in IPL]]

[[rohit_sharmas_performance_for_mumbai_indians | Rohit Sharma's performance for Mumbai Indians]] in the [[rohit_sharmas_ipl_performance_versus_expectations | IPL]] has been described as "blowing hot and cold," with more "cold than hot" periods recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

### Batting Strategy Comparison: India vs. Mumbai Indians

There is a notable [[comparison_of_rohit_sharmas_roles_for_mumbai_indians_and_india | difference in Rohit Sharma's batting strategy]] when playing for India compared to Mumbai Indians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. For India, especially in T20s and ODIs, he made a conscious decision to adopt an aggressive, attacking approach, aiming to "smash the ball" and change the team's white-ball cricket philosophy from being "anchors" to "dominant ones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This aggressive [[rohit_sharmas_impact_and_batting_strategy | impact]] meant that when he started going, opposition teams would "crap their pants" because they knew he could score 100 runs off 30 balls and completely change the game, becoming an "unstoppable force" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

However, this aggressive mindset appears to shift when he plays for Mumbai Indians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Despite Mumbai having a strong batting lineup, he often adopts a more cautious approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. It is suggested that he should instead "smash the ball" and aim for quick scores like 28 off 14 balls, leveraging the depth of the team's batting order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

### IPL Strike Rate

[[rohit_sharmas_ipl_performance_versus_expectations | Rohit Sharma]] has never achieved a strike rate of over 150 in an IPL season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Considering his aggressive batting for India in recent years, it's suggested he should be capable of striking at 160 or 165 in the IPL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. The "impact sub" rule, which allows for more aggressive play, has not seemingly influenced his batting approach for Mumbai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. It is speculated that he prefers the higher risk associated with only 11 players, as in international cricket, which encourages him to go after the bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### Batting Position in IPL

While [[rohit_sharmas_performance_as_an_opener | Rohit Sharma]] is expected to open for Mumbai Indians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, his best numbers in the IPL have historically been at number four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

### Post-Captaincy Role

A potential reason for his fluctuating [[rohit_sharmas_ipl_performance_versus_expectations | IPL performance]] might stem from an existential dilemma regarding his role within the Mumbai Indians ecosystem after relinquishing captaincy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Having contributed significantly to the franchise, finding his place as a senior player who may or may not be part of the leadership group can be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This transition can deeply affect a player's form, as was observed with Virat Kohli after his captaincy change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

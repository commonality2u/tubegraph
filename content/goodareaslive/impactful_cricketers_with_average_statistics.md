The podcast "Crick Picks" features a segment where hosts and guests draft their top five cricketers who were "better than their numbers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. This subjective exercise highlights players whose statistical records don't fully reflect their talent, impact, or the challenges they faced during their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.

## Crick Picks Draft: Better Than Their Numbers

The show uses a snake-style draft competition, where participants select their top five players for a given category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. For this episode, the focus was on cricketers whose on-field presence and perceived ability surpassed what their career statistics might suggest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

### Pick Highlights

Here are some of the players chosen by the hosts and guests, along with the reasoning behind their selections:

#### Freddy Flintoff
Picked first, [[evaluating_cricket_allrounders_using_statistics_and_impact | Freddy Flintoff]] was described as "magic" and "box office absolute theater" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. Despite being an "Ashes Jesus" for England in 2005 and 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>, his numbers tell a different story:
*   **Test Cricket**: Batting average of 31.77, bowling average of 32.77 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.
*   **ODIs**: Batting average of 32, bowling average of 24.38 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.
*   He never "could crack" T20 [[cricket_and_player_performances | cricket]], despite seemingly being built for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.
The speaker believes he had a much higher ceiling and could have achieved a better record had he been more disciplined or avoided numerous injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. It was also suggested he often bowled the "wrong length" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

#### Aravinda de Silva
Despite a Test average of 43 with over 6,000 runs, [[historical_c_ricketers_with_overlooked_achievements | Aravinda de Silva]] is widely considered in Sri Lanka to be better than his record suggests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. Many [[comparison_of_cricket_legends | great cricketers]] in Sri Lanka, including Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene, regarded him as the best batter from the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. He reportedly had a higher peak than Sangakkara or Jayawardene, especially during the 1996 World Cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>, and played in a "tough batting era" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>.

#### WG Grace
WG Grace's inclusion is debated because his numbers *were* outstanding for his era, but his Test average in the low 30s often leads modern viewers to undervalue him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>. It's noted that he played Test [[cricket_and_player_performances | cricket]] well past his best, essentially as a doctor rather than a full-time professional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>. Some historical experts like Abash Mukari believed he could be considered the best batter of all time, even ahead of Bradman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>. His average of 33 was very high at a time when others averaged in the 20s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>.

#### Graeme Gooch
[[evaluating_current_cricket_players_across_formats | Graeme Gooch]] is cited as a player whose full game developed later in his career, making his overall average less impressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>. Despite a "very disappointing batting average" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>, he is considered one of the greatest players over the age of 30, particularly noted for his incredible innings against the West Indies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>.

#### Mohammad Amir
Though he doesn't have a bad record, Mohammad Amir is considered by some to have not fulfilled his immense potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>. His career was significantly impacted by missing five years due to a fixing ban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>. His averages include 25 in Tests, 29 in ODIs, and 21 in T20s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>. It is believed that he would have had a "far better record" if he had played throughout his peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>.

#### Learie Constantine
Considered one of the biggest [[impact_of_star_players_in_cricket | stars]] to come out of the Caribbean in his era, Learie Constantine's numbers were "very very substandard" in Test [[cricket_and_player_performances | cricket]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>. He played 18 Tests, averaging below 20 with the bat (19.24) and over 30 with the ball (30.10) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:03:00">[13:03:00]</a>. Despite this, he was an electric fielder, a quick bowler, and a belligerent batter, capable of smashing quick runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:00">[12:15:00]</a>, as demonstrated by a century in an hour against Middlesex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:37:00">[12:37:00]</a>.

#### Moeen Ali
[[evaluating_current_cricket_players_across_formats | Moeen Ali]] was an [[evaluating_cricket_allrounders_using_statistics_and_impact | all-rounder]] who often filled gaps for England, without a fixed batting position or role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:24:00">[14:24:00]</a>. His statistics (Test batting average 28, ODI 24, T20 21; Test bowling average 37, ODI 48, T20 27) might suggest he "sucks" to future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:30:00">[14:30:00]</a>. However, his [[impact_of_star_players_in_cricket | impact]] was immense, providing "impeccable balance" to the English team, and he was a World Cup winner in both T20 and ODI formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:03:00">[15:03:00]</a>.

#### Carl Hooper
Carl Hooper's batting average of 36 in Test [[cricket_and_player_performances | cricket]] and 35 in ODIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:39:00">[16:39:00]</a> is considered to "definitely" be an underachievement for a batter of his caliber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47:00">[16:47:00]</a>. Like Aravinda de Silva, when he "decided to bat," he was "absolutely remarkable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:14:00">[17:14:00]</a>. His bowling average of 45 or 50 also doesn't reflect his perceived ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:31:00">[17:31:00]</a>.

#### Daryl Cullinan
Daryl Cullinan was described as an "actual top top level player" who played in an incredibly tough era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:19:00">[18:19:00]</a>. His statistics (44 average in Tests, 33 in ODIs) were depressed by the era and his struggle against Shane Warne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:22:00">[18:22:00]</a>. It's suggested he was a much better player than his record implies, especially due to his specific vulnerability to Warne's bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:31:00">[18:31:00]</a>.

#### Daniel Vettori
[[evaluating_cricket_allrounders_using_statistics_and_impact | Daniel Vettori]] had to bowl in New Zealand for a long period when conditions were against his type of bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:09:00">[19:09:00]</a>. He averages 30 with the bat in Tests, which is considered good for his role, but his bowling average of 34.36 in Tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:39:00">[19:39:00]</a> and 31.95 in ODIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:57:00">[19:57:00]</a> does not reflect his consistent performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:15:00">[20:15:00]</a>. He was likely picked five years too early due to New Zealand's lack of other spinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:30:00">[19:30:00]</a>.

#### Mark Waugh
Mark Waugh, often considered the more talented and stylish of the Waugh brothers, has a Test average of 41 and an ODI average of 39 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:47:00">[21:47:00]</a>. It is felt his ceiling was much higher and he didn't quite reach those levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:56:00">[21:56:00]</a>. Part of the reason for his lower average is that he would often get to 100 and then get out, rarely making very large scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:33:00">[22:33:00]</a>. His ODI [[cricket_and_player_performances | cricket]] was also underrated; he was "money in the bank" for consistent runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:13:00">[23:13:00]</a>.

#### Mark Ramprakash
Mark Ramprakash showed a massive disparity between his first-class and Test statistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:40:00">[24:40:00]</a>. In 461 first-class games, he scored 114 centuries and averaged 53.14 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:33:00">[24:33:00]</a>. However, in 52 Tests, his average plummeted to 27.32 with only two centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:42:00">[24:42:00]</a>. Described as one of the best batters the speaker had ever seen live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:26:00">[25:26:00]</a>, something "clearly went wrong" in his transition to international [[cricket_and_player_performances | cricket]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:48:00">[24:48:00]</a>.

#### Imran Nazir
Imran Nazir was a "Livewire" with the bat and in the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:43:00">[26:43:00]</a>, often considered Pakistan's answer to Chris Gayle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:50:00">[26:50:00]</a>. Despite playing in an era where he could have excelled, his numbers (Test average 32.84, ODI 24.62, T20 22.80) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:01:00">[27:01:00]</a> do not reflect his aggressive style. He was seen as a player who should have been playing every T20 game for Pakistan when the format was introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:28:00">[27:28:00]</a>, and was the best batter in the Indian Cricket League (ICL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:33:00">[27:33:00]</a>.

#### Yuvraj Singh
[[emerging_cricket_talents_and_their_impact | Yuvraj Singh]] was touted as the "next big thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:12:00">[28:12:00]</a>, and while he achieved a lot, his numbers (ODI average 36, T20 average 28; Test average 34) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:24:00">[28:24:00]</a> are seen as not reflecting his talent, particularly in the limited overs game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:20:00">[28:20:00]</a>. He also contributed as a handy left-arm spinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:46:00">[28:46:00]</a>.

#### Clem Hill
[[historical_c_ricketers_with_overlooked_achievements | Clem Hill]] is identified as "probably the first great left-hander" with an incredible strike rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:26:00">[29:26:00]</a>. However, he is often overlooked by historians because he played in the same era as Victor Trumper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:32:00">[29:32:00]</a> and finished with an average just under 40 (39) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:45:00">[29:45:00]</a>. Despite his strong performance for his era, his numbers don't "pop" in modern [[understanding_cricket_statistics | cricket statistics]], leading to his underestimation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:29:00">[30:29:00]</a>.

The discussion highlights that different participants approached the "better than their numbers" category from varying perspectives: players with high potential but didn't quite achieve it, players hampered by injuries or external factors, players who peaked later, or [[historical_c_ricketers_with_overlooked_achievements | historical players]] whose statistics are misunderstood in a modern context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:12:00">[31:12:00]</a>. Other notable mentions for this category included Graham Hick, Adrien Barath, Aiden Markram, Ben Stokes, Mohammad Ashraful, and Martin Crowe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:42:00">[31:42:00]</a>.

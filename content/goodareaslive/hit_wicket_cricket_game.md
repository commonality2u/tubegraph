## Gameplay and Features
This [[cricket_strategies_and_game_analysis | strategic cricket game]] is not based on "frantic tapping" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

For instance, the game understands that a batter must be set up correctly and a six cannot be hit on the first ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. It incorporates these realistic [[cricket_game_strategy_and_player_decisions | Cricket]] aspects alongside "a few gaming twists" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

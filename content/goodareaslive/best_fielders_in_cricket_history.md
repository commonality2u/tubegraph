The CrickPics Podcast, in its 11th episode, discussed and drafted their top five greatest fielders in cricket history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. The selection process was a snake-style draft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.

## Top Picks for Best Fielders

### Faf du Plessis
Jared Kimber's top pick, [[notable_cricket_fielding_performances | Faf du Plessis]], is considered by him as arguably the best fielder of all time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. CricViz or Hawk-Eye Cricket reportedly had him as the best slips fielder in their database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. When he was young and fit, he was likely a top five outfielder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. His unique strength lies in combining excellence in both slip fielding and outfielding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. An anecdote recalls him playing club cricket in England, with [[best_test_cricket_allrounders_in_history | AB de Villiers]] joining for a game, resulting in an exceptionally strong fielding display with du Plessis at point and de Villiers at cover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.

### Ravi Jadeja
Baram Kazi's first pick, [[best_test_cricket_allrounders_in_history | Ravi Jadeja]], is highlighted as perhaps the best contemporary fielder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. He is known for his "bullet arm," being a great outfielder, and a very reliable catcher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. Jadeja is noted for achieving many run-outs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. A specific catch he took in a Test match in New Zealand was described as "Ben Stokes' catch from the World Cup versus South Africa, but kind of better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.

### Ricky Ponting
Estelle Vasu selected [[greatest_odi_batters_of_all_time | Ricky Ponting]] as her top choice, emphasizing his prowess in the slips, infield, and his high number of direct hits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. His incredible ability to hit the stumps, especially in limited-overs cricket, elevated him to another level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.

### Jonty Rhodes
[[notable_cricket_fielding_performances | Jonty Rhodes]] was picked by Estelle, citing his superb athleticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>. He is recognized as the first fielder of his level to visibly impact matches, revolutionizing the perception of [[impact_of_fielding_on_cricket_matches | fielding]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>. While celebrated for his athleticism and ground covered, his hands for clean catches and accuracy in hitting the stumps were debated in comparison to other top fielders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>.

### AB de Villiers
Baram Kazi picked [[best_test_cricket_allrounders_in_history | AB de Villiers]], describing him as a brilliant all-rounder, a very good catcher, and an outfielder who occasionally kept wicket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>. De Villiers was an "absolute Livewire" in the field, consistently forcing dismissals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>. His exceptional athleticism transcended cricket, suggesting he could have excelled in multiple sports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>.

### Garfield Sobers
Jared Kimber selected [[best_test_cricket_allrounders_in_history | Garfield Sobers]], highlighting stories of him regularly taking difficult catches running back with the flight, similar to Ben Stokes' famous World Cup catch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>. His ability to field effectively in every single position was considered a key strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>. Sobers was seen as a revolutionary fielder who took the game to the next level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>.

### Colin Bland
Jared's next pick was Colin Bland, described as "Jonty Rhodes 40 years before Jonty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>. His relative obscurity is attributed to his career coinciding with the apartheid era in South Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:00">[12:18:00]</a>. Bland was so captivating that people would attend matches just to watch his fielding practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:00">[12:35:00]</a>. He combined incredible athleticism, getting to every ball, with extreme accuracy in hitting the stumps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49:00">[12:49:00]</a>.

### Paul Collingwood
Baram Kazi picked [[notable_cricket_fielding_performances | Paul Collingwood]], impressed by his immense catching ability and quickness on his feet as an outfielder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:32:00">[14:32:00]</a>. Collingwood was a utility cricketer whose fielding was considered his best asset among his batting and bowling skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>. He took "crazy catches" during his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:29:00">[15:29:00]</a>.

### Kieron Pollard
Estelle Vasu picked [[greatest_odi_batters_of_all_time | Kieron Pollard]], noting his rare drops despite his large hands and athleticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:35:00">[16:35:00]</a>. Pollard makes boundary catches look simple and is an all-round great athlete with good ground fielding and closing skills, even fielding under the helmet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:49:00">[16:49:00]</a>. He is arguably one of the greatest boundary fielders ever, embodying the "Parry catch" where a fielder sends the ball back before recatching it after crossing the boundary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:30:00">[17:30:00]</a>.

### Andrew Symonds
Estelle's final pick was [[best_test_cricket_allrounders_in_history | Andrew Symonds]], admired for his incredible athleticism and frequent direct hits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:54:00">[19:54:00]</a>. He was deceptively quick for his size, excelling in the infield and outfield, with superb catching and a bullet arm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:07:00">[20:07:00]</a>. Symonds, like Jonty Rhodes and Colin Bland, thought about fielding differently, viewing it as equally important as batting and bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:21:00">[21:21:00]</a>. He is considered one of the better arms in cricket and potentially the best boundary rider alongside Kieron Pollard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:00:00">[22:00:00]</a>. He was also regarded as one of the best fielders off his own bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:41:00">[22:41:00]</a>.

### Ben Stokes
Baram Kazi selected [[great_batters_in_cricket_history | Ben Stokes]], highlighting his splendid catches in the slips and gully, including one-handed screamers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:26:00">[23:26:00]</a>. His amazing one-handed take running back in the 2019 World Cup inaugural game was specifically mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:36:00">[23:36:00]</a>. Stokes frequently hits the stumps and is known for being very alert, big, capable of holding onto ridiculous catches, and possessing a bullet arm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:47:00">[23:47:00]</a>. While he may "clang" a bit more as a slip fielder, he reaches many slip chances that others wouldn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:17:00">[24:17:00]</a>. He is undoubtedly an athlete who fits the mold of top fielders, getting to balls other fielders cannot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:40:00">[24:40:00]</a>.

### Mark Waugh
Jared Kimber's penultimate pick was Mark Waugh, whom he acknowledged as perhaps the "worst athlete" on a list of highly athletic fielders, yet still a very good one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:13:00">[26:13:00]</a>. Waugh was described as a "slow-moving great athlete" who "saw things differently," not needing to run as quickly because he was always in the right position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:28:00">[27:28:00]</a>. He could field in every single position from short leg to boundary rider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:53:00">[26:53:00]</a>. Waugh possessed "almost as good a first touch with his hands" as any fielder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:06:00">[27:06:00]</a>. His reflexes at slip were noted, with him being Jared's favorite second slip fielder of all time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:37:00">[27:37:00]</a>.

### Jim Laker
Jared Kimber's final pick was Jim Laker. Despite never having seen him field, Jared selected him based on "next level" stories about his fielding prowess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:05:00">[29:05:00]</a>. It was suggested that to average only 15 in Test cricket, a player must have been "close to the best fielder in the world for a long period of time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:33:00">[29:33:00]</a>. Stories exist of Laker regularly winning games with his fielding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:43:00">[29:43:00]</a>. He was described as a "legend" with a lasting fan club 20 years after his retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:07:00">[30:07:00]</a>.

### Shadab Khan
Baram Kazi made a "biased pick" with Shadab Khan, asserting him as the best Pakistani fielder to have ever lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:35:00">[32:35:00]</a>. Shadab is considered terrific in the field, a very good point fielder, equally skilled at catching and stopping quick shots, and having a fair few direct hits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:53:00">[32:53:00]</a>. He was once described as the best fielder from Pakistan, even at a very young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:35:00">[33:35:00]</a>.

### Steve Smith
Estelle Vasu's final pick was [[great_batters_in_cricket_history | Steve Smith]], recognizing him as a really good catcher who is quick and consistently puts extra pressure on the opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:49:00">[35:49:00]</a>. He hardly misses anything, and his consistent goodness can make his exceptional [[significance_of_fielding_and_catch_efficiency_in_cricket | fielding]] seem less special <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:00:00">[36:00:00]</a>. Young Steve Smith was described as "almost a combination of Ponting and Jonty Rhodes" due to his incredible movement and game-reading ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:42:00">[36:42:00]</a>.

> The discussion highlights the [[evolution_of_cricket_fielding_over_time | evolution of fielding]], noting that it wasn't as emphasized or trained in earlier eras, particularly before World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:32:00">[37:32:00]</a>. Fielders like Jonty Rhodes and Colin Bland are credited with revolutionizing the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>, showcasing how individual brilliance can shift the perception and importance of a skill in the game.

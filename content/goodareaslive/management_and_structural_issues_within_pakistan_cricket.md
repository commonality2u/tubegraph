Pakistan cricket, a nation historically known for its "wickets and sexiness," has recently experienced a significant decline, particularly in its bowling prowess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:15">[01:32:15]</a>. This downturn is attributed not just to on-field performance but to deep-seated [[structure_and_governance_of_pakistan_cricket | management and structural issues]] within the country's cricketing administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:02">[01:11:02]</a>.

## Current Decline and "Wicketless Streak"

Modern-day Pakistan finds taking 20 wickets in a Test match a "gargantuan task" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. This is alarming given their rich fast-bowling heritage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. The current team is facing a "winless streak" at home, particularly since the start of the Australian series in March 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. In 10 Test matches since then, Pakistan took 128 wickets and only managed to take 20 wickets in a Test on one occasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

During these 10 winless home Tests, Pakistan's local bowlers averaged 47 with the ball, in stark contrast to opposition bowlers who averaged 36, an 11-run difference per wicket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. This indicates that the flat pitches, while a factor, are not the main pain point, as opposition teams are still taking wickets effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

In this period (since early 2022), Pakistan's pace bowling average at home is 38 runs per wicket, the worst in the world, and their spin bowling average is 41, only better than Ireland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. Overall, Pakistan has the second-worst bowling average among all teams, at 39.46 runs per dismissal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.

## Leadership and Policy Decisions

A significant contributor to the current issues stems from policy decisions, particularly during the tenure of Rameez Raja as chairman. There was a clear decision to make pitches even flatter to prolong Test matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. This was perhaps a misunderstanding of modern Test cricket, as four-day Tests often work better due to quicker movement and excitement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. This policy resulted in "the most flat wickets of all time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

## Systemic Problems

The core issue facing [[pakistans_cricket_strategy_and_performance_issues | Pakistan's cricket strategy and performance issues]] is a fundamental lack of [[professionalism_and_player_development_in_pakistan | professionalism and a proper system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:11">[00:53:11]</a>.

### "Savior Complex" and Lack of Structure
Pakistan cricket suffers from a "savior complex" or "Messiah complex," where there are no established systems, and the focus is always on finding a hero to "fix everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. Even those in leadership roles view themselves as such saviors, as exemplified by Rameez Raja <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>. The real need is to "put some structure in place and have that system which works as a well-oiled machine so that there is continuity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.

### Poor Injury Management
The PCB "excels at poor injury management" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. Star bowlers like Shaheen Shah Afridi and Naseem Shah have suffered from injuries, and their rehabilitation processes are often mishandled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. Shaheen was rushed back after an injury for the World Cup, leading to further issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>. This means the two best bowlers are often not fully fit or available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.

### Lack of Continuity and Experience
There is a consistent lack of continuity in selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. During the recent winless streak, apart from Shaheen and Naseem, six other seamers were tried, most with negligible prior Test experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. This constant rotation and search for a "mystery seamer" or "savior" means young players are thrown into high-pressure situations without proper development or consistent exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>.

### Financial Instability and Cronyism
The PCB faces significant financial issues, evidenced by the fact that the men's and women's teams were not paid for four months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>. Despite "overpaying all of those mentors," the board cannot pay its actual cricketers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.

There are also "crony appointments," with people being hired based on their connections to the chairman rather than merit, including a former analyst from the "ministry of Forestry and Fisheries" appointed as a media manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>.

### Poor Workload Management and Prioritization
Pakistan's workload management is poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:16">[01:00:16]</a>. Key bowlers like Haris Rauf, Shaheen Shah Afridi, and Naseem Shah are played in insignificant T20 matches (e.g., against Nepal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:20">[01:00:20]</a>, leading to injuries and exhaustion by the time crucial Test matches arrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:25">[01:00:25]</a>. This highlights a lack of prioritization for Test cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:39">[01:00:39]</a>.

### Lack of Defined Playing Style
Unlike other professional cricketing nations that have a clear style of play (e.g., England's "Bazball"), Pakistan lacks a defined cricketing style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:28">[00:59:28]</a>. "Not a single person would be able to answer that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:36">[00:59:36]</a>. This absence of a cohesive strategy affects player development and team cohesion.

## Conclusion

The current [[challenges_faced_by_pakistans_bowling_attack | challenges faced by Pakistan's bowling attack]] are a direct consequence of a lack of professionalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:27">[00:53:27]</a>, a chaotic management structure, and the absence of a sustainable system. While Pakistan continues to unearth talented players, their progress is hampered by inadequate support systems and inconsistent policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:11">[01:02:11]</a>. For Pakistan to regain its past glory and achieve consistent success, a fundamental shift towards professionalism and structured governance is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:17">[01:02:17]</a>.

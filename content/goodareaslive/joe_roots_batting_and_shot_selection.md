From: [[goodareaslive]] <br/> 

England began the day with "precocious vibes," which led to [[major_performances_from_joe_root_and_harry_brook | Joe Root]] playing a shot that "broke the internet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This moment contributed to England losing a significant advantage over India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## The Reverse Scoop Shot

[[major_performances_from_joe_root_and_harry_brook | Joe Root]]'s reverse scoop, an attacking shot in Test cricket, is statistically his "worst attacking shot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:17">[03:17:17]</a>. Before this particular dismissal, the shot's average was comparable to his cover drive and on drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:24">[03:24:24]</a>.

Despite its risk, [[major_performances_from_joe_root_and_harry_brook | Root]] has played the reverse scoop 24 times in Tests, scoring 66 runs from those 24 balls, equating to 16 runs per over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:43">[04:43:43]</a>. He employs this shot strategically, often when bowlers are bowling defensively or from a specific angle, such as left-arm bowlers over the wicket with no third man fielder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:06">[05:06:06]</a>. The intention is to hit the ball over the fielders for a boundary or even a six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:55">[10:55:55]</a>.

### Execution Against Jasprit Bumrah

Against Jasprit Bumrah, the angle of the delivery was wide and tight, making it difficult for [[major_performances_from_joe_root_and_harry_brook | Root]] to fully extend his arms, increasing the risk of an LBW <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:32">[08:32:32]</a>. While [[major_performances_from_joe_root_and_harry_brook | Root]] got into position early and attempted to loft the ball, he failed to get under it, leading to poor execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:42">[09:42:42]</a>. The catch by Jurel at slip was exceptional, as it's rare for a slip fielder to take such a dismissal off the face of the bat against seam bowlers in a reverse fashion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:16">[10:16:16]</a>.

It is suggested that it might have been the "wrong bowler" to play that specific shot against or simply a moment of bad luck in execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:52:52">[13:52:52]</a>. The shot is inherently risky, as it involves not playing with a straight bat and being off-balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:39">[13:39:39]</a>.

## [[englands_batting_strategy_and_basball_philosophy | Bazball]]'s Influence on Joe Root

A common question is whether [[englands_batting_strategy_and_basball_philosophy | Bazball]] is "ruining" [[major_performances_from_joe_root_and_harry_brook | Joe Root]]'s batting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:03">[07:03:03]</a>. Data suggests otherwise:

*   **Before [[englands_batting_strategy_and_basball_philosophy | Bazball]]:** Root averaged 49.19, while other batters averaged 34.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:01">[06:01:01]</a>.
*   **During his two-year peak (pre-[[englands_batting_strategy_and_basball_philosophy | Bazball]]):** Root averaged 52, with the rest of the top order averaging 31 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:19">[06:19:19]</a>.
*   **During [[englands_batting_strategy_and_basball_philosophy | Bazball]]:** Root's actual average is not significantly different from his peak (around 51.5), while the team's overall run-scoring has increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:35">[06:35:35]</a>.

This indicates that [[major_performances_from_joe_root_and_harry_brook | Root]] has largely maintained his average under [[englands_batting_strategy_and_basball_philosophy | Bazball]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:36">[07:36:36]</a>. His natural batting style, which includes excellent strike rotation and an ability to change bowlers' lengths (especially with spin), aligns well with [[englands_batting_strategy_and_basball_philosophy | Bazball]]'s principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:51">[07:51:51]</a>.

Ultimately, playing attacking shots in cricket involves risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:3:41">[00:3:41]</a>. While [[major_performances_from_joe_root_and_harry_brook | Root]]'s risk on this occasion didn't pay off, in contrast to [[rohit_sharmas_impact_and_batting_strategy | Rohit Sharma]]'s successful risks in another match, this is a natural consequence of aggressive play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.

### Role as a Bowler
While [[major_performances_from_joe_root_and_harry_brook | Joe Root]] is a prolific batter, his role as a bowler is a subject of discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:56">[01:08:56]</a>. He is not considered a frontline bowler due to inconsistency in landing the ball on a consistent length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:15">[01:09:15]</a>. However, he can be very effective against left-handers in certain conditions, as demonstrated by his dismissal of [[rohit_sharmas_impact_and_batting_strategy | Rohit Sharma]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:07">[01:09:07]</a>. His best deliveries can be frontline-worthy, but his overall consistency is not that of a specialist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:04">[01:09:04]</a>.

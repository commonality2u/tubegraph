## Muhammad Shami's Exceptional Performance
[[muhammad_shamis_bowling_performance | Muhammad Shami]] has emerged as a significant force in the current World Cup, despite initially being kept out of the side for R Ashwin and Shardul Thakur [02:27:00], [02:37:00]. Looking back, the decision to exclude him seems bizarre [02:57:00].

Shami now holds the equal 11th most wickets in World Cup history [03:03:00], having leapfrogged many talented bowlers during this tournament [03:32:00]. His strike rate in the World Cup is sensational, taking a wicket every 16.9 balls [04:05:00], [04:14:00], which is even better than [[bowlers_impact_in_icc_tournaments | Mitchell Starc]] [04:55:00]. The fact that he began the tournament on India's bench highlights his incredible impact [05:02:00].

His spell against Ben Stokes demonstrated his remarkable skill, as he consistently moved the ball both ways – in-swing and away-swing – seemingly at will [05:30:00], [05:35:00], [06:10:00], [06:17:00], [08:00:00], [10:15:00]. This forced Stokes into a poor shot, leading to his dismissal [06:26:00], [06:40:00], [07:23:00], [10:48:00]. Shami is considered the best strike bowler in World Cup history [11:24:00]. He is also noted for needing the new ball more than Siraj [00:46:32] and has been bowling better than he did in 2019 [00:47:40].

## Jasprit Bumrah's Tactical Brilliance
[[role_and_performance_of_key_players_like_bumrah_shami_and_gill_in_the_world_cup | Jasprit Bumrah]]'s wickets in a recent match showcased his intelligent thinking [11:31:00], [11:33:00]. He possesses the rare ability to bowl equally effectively both over and around the wicket [12:05:00], [12:11:00], [13:06:00]. A key aspect of his success is knowing precisely when to adapt his bowling approach [12:40:00].

Against Dawid Malan, Bumrah changed his line from over the wicket to around the wicket, leading to a chop-on wicket [12:05:00], [13:15:00]. For Joe Root's wicket, he explicitly requested a second slip and openly discussed aiming for a back-of-a-length delivery, only to deceive Root with a full and straight ball [13:41:00], [14:26:00]. Bumrah's unique action, releasing the ball closer to the batsman, makes it come on quicker, adding to his potency [15:11:00], [15:14:00]. He excels at beating players with a combination of pace, movement, and cunning tactics [15:50:00].

## Chris Woakes' Shifting Role
Chris Woakes moved the ball effectively in 2019 [01:02:00] and bowled well in a recent match [28:40:00]. His wicket of Shubman Gill demonstrated significant movement, with a wide delivery coming back a long way [25:52:00], [25:54:00]. This particular delivery was recorded as his most seamed power play delivery of the tournament [26:45:00].

Woakes was integral to England's ODI success between 2015 and 2019, primarily due to his ability to take new ball wickets [27:02:00], [27:07:00]. During that era, he had the most power play wickets and maintained an average in the low 20s [27:17:00], [27:22:00]. However, he has transitioned from being a swing bowler to primarily using the wobble ball [27:49:00], [27:56:00]. This shift means he sacrifices some of his other skills, such as the ability to swing the ball the very next delivery [27:58:00]. Consequently, his performance against left-handers has declined because he no longer relies on the inswinger [28:31:00], [28:33:00], [28:36:00].

## Overall Bowler Impact in the World Cup
The current World Cup has proven to be more "wicket-taking" than anticipated [16:58:00], [17:33:00]. While off-spinners have been hard to score against, they haven't dominated [17:18:00], [17:23:00]. Left-arm finger spinners are getting wickets, but leg-spinners are struggling [17:25:00], [17:31:00]. Seam bowlers, however, are taking a high number of wickets [17:32:00], [17:33:00].

India's bowling attack, featuring a combination of quicks and spinners, has been a key factor in their success. The team's bowlers are all capable of taking wickets, rather than just being defensive [00:48:02]. This depth allows India to rely on their bowling attack even when setting smaller targets [20:00:00], [20:34:00], a valuable trait before knockout stages [20:01:00]. Their current numbers suggest they have the best strike bowling team ever in One Day International (ODI) cricket [00:43:39], [00:46:00], [00:47:00].

The ability of bowlers to adapt has become crucial in modern cricket. Players like [[role_and_impact_of_part_time_bowlers_in_cricket | Jasprit Bumrah]] can effortlessly switch between bowling over and around the wicket, a skill not all bowlers possess [12:05:00], [12:11:00], [13:06:00]. Similarly, wrist spinners now employ varied grips (across the seam, smooth side, rough side) to achieve different movements and bounce, adding to their effectiveness [00:48:50], [00:49:10], [00:49:12], [00:49:22]. This advanced understanding of bowling mechanics, aided by modern cameras, makes them far more potent [00:49:51], [00:49:56]. The tournament has highlighted the increasing importance of seam bowling and the ability to handle the short ball in international cricket [00:42:33], [00:43:00].

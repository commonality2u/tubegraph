## Series Overview

India secured a 2-0 series sweep against Bangladesh. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a> The second Test in Kanpur concluded in practically two days, showcasing a rapid change in the game's pace. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a> This match was considered "unwinnable" at the start of day four due to two full days being washed out, yet India managed to win it. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>

### India's Aggressive Approach
India's approach was highly result-oriented and aggressive, a notable departure from older Indian teams. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a> They were willing to score at exceptional rates, similar to the "Bazball" philosophy but with their own flair (dubbed "Jabas ball" by some). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a> This included declaring early with a lead of only 50-odd runs. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>

India set multiple Test cricket records for the fastest team scores:
*   Fastest 50 in three overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>
*   Fastest team 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>
*   Fastest team 150 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>
*   Fastest team 200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>
*   Fastest team 250 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>

#### Bowling
*   **Ravichandran Ashwin**: Awarded Player of the Series. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a> He took five wickets in this Test, including three for 50 in the third innings. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a> Ashwin now has 11 Player of the Series awards in his career, matching Muttiah Muralitharan's record but achieving it in fewer series (43 vs. 61). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a> He is recognized as a "once in a generation cricketer" for India. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>
*   **Ravindra Jadeja**: Took four wickets in the game, including three for 34 in the third innings. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a> He became the 11th cricketer in Test history, and only the third Indian (alongside Kapil Dev and Ravichandran Ashwin), to score more than 3,000 runs and take a minimum of 300 wickets. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>

### Bangladesh

*   **Mehedi Hasan Miraz**: Scored an unbeaten 107 in the first innings and took six wickets, including a four-wicket haul. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:34:44]</a>

*   The team largely "folded like a house of cards" and could not bat for time, which was necessary to save the match. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>
*   Bangladesh's fielding was noted to be "frazzled," including a missed run-out opportunity. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>

## Venue Concerns: Kanpur's Green Park Stadium
The venue, Green Park Stadium in Kanpur, was a major talking point due to poor drainage which resulted in two days of play being washed out. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a> Despite full ground covers, water was standing on top, indicating drainage issues on the clay-based surface. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:13">[00:50:13]</a> Virat Kohli's 2019 suggestion for five major Test centers in India to ensure better quality control, predictable conditions, and larger crowds was brought up. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a> The discussion highlighted the disconnect between the BCCI's financial power and the local grounds' ability to maintain world-class facilities without subsidies. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:44">[00:51:44]</a>

## India's Test Dominance
India has not lost a Test series at home since 2012 against England. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:45">[00:45:45]</a> They currently hold a record of 18 consecutive Test series wins at home. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a> This puts them closer to the West Indies team's record of not losing a home Test series for 20 years (1974-1994). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a> The continuous presence of all-rounders like Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja provides immense flexibility and strength to the team. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>

## Match Summary

The [[cricket_world_cup_2023_analysis | Cricket World Cup 2023]] match between India and England saw England starting their innings resembling their 2019 form in terms of bowling, but ending it similar to 1999 [00:00:50]. Commentators initially believed England would win comfortably, especially once India passed 170 runs [00:01:23]. However, conditions proved more helpful for the Indian bowlers [00:01:38].

## England's Performance

### Bowling
England's bowlers, including Chris Woakes and David Willey, moved the ball effectively [00:01:02]. Adil Rashid took wickets, and a "northerner" (likely Mark Wood) generated pace [00:01:06]. Moeen Ali was difficult to hit [00:01:10].

*   **Chris Woakes:** Took the wicket of Shubman Gill, with the ball moving significantly back into the batter [00:25:36]. This delivery was noted as the most "seamed in" power play delivery for Woakes in the tournament [00:26:42]. Historically, Woakes was a key part of England's success from 2015-2019 due to his new ball wickets, leading in power play wickets during that era with an average around the low 20s [00:27:02]. However, he has largely focused on wobble-ball bowling, which has reduced his ability to swing the ball and affected his performance, particularly against left-handers [00:27:49]. His average against right-handers has worsened since two years ago, but against left-handers, it shows a significant difference, highlighting the absence of his inswinger [00:28:17].

### Batting
England's batters approached their innings as if "deciding what movie you're going to watch on the flight on the way home" [00:01:46]. They are considered to have mounted the "worst World Cup defense" ever seen, effectively "attacked last place" [00:02:07].

*   **Joe Root:** Since the 2019 World Cup, when England has lost early wickets and Root has had to bat in the power play (18 times), he has been dismissed 11 times. In 132 power play deliveries, he has scored 50 runs at an average of 4.54 and a strike rate of 37 [00:29:14]. This is considered surprising for an "insurance batter" of his talent [00:29:35]. His struggles against the new white ball, especially when it is wobbling, are noted, contrasting with his red-ball play [01:14:17]. His dismissals in the series included a golden duck, being bowled through his legs by Glenn Phillips, and a run-out [01:14:38].
*   **Dawid Malan:** His wicket was crucial, falling for 16 off 16 balls [00:11:54].
*   **Overall Batting:** England's batting average in the tournament is "mud," only marginally better than the Netherlands [00:31:27]. They are losing a wicket every 24 balls (or every four overs), meaning they are averaging around 40 overs per innings [00:32:27]. This is seen as a regression to 40-over cricket [00:32:45].

### Team Status
As of this match, England has won one game and lost five out of six played in the tournament, making it potentially the "worst World Cup defense of all time" [00:33:57]. This is particularly notable given they are dual World Cup holders and play Test cricket like One-Day International (ODI) cricket [00:34:09]. Their decline is partly attributed to not playing enough ODI cricket with their best players prior to the tournament [00:40:12]. Additionally, other teams have caught up in batting, while England's bowling has declined, removing their natural advantage [00:52:35]. Player form is also a significant factor [00:52:20].

## India's Performance

### Bowling
India's bowlers performed exceptionally well, capitalizing on helpful conditions [00:01:38].

*   **Mohammed Shami:** Despite initially being kept out of the side for Ravichandran Ashwin and later Shardul Thakur, Shami has had a remarkable journey in the tournament [00:02:24]. He now has the equal 11th most wickets in World Cup history [00:03:03]. His strike rate in World Cups is outstanding, taking a wicket every 17 balls (16.9 actually) [00:04:05]. This is five balls better than Mitchell Starc, a prolific strike bowler [00:04:55].
    *   **Spell against Ben Stokes:** Shami's bowling against Ben Stokes showcased incredible skill. He started with a ball coming in with the angle, followed by one going away [00:05:30]. He continued to move the ball both ways, making Stokes tentative [00:10:07]. Stokes's strategy became trying to deflect the ball into the offside to get it damp, rather than hitting for boundaries, due to Shami's exceptional control [00:07:08]. Shami's deliveries were so good that Stokes struggled to get anything away, eventually playing a "horrible shot" to a ball that pitched long but came in sharply, making Stokes look "absolutely ridiculous" [00:09:19]. This spell is considered brilliant bowling from potentially the "best strike bowler in the history of World Cup Cricket" [00:10:55].
*   **Jasprit Bumrah:** His wickets demonstrated clever thinking [00:11:31].
    *   **Wicket of Dawid Malan:** Bumrah initially bowled over the wicket to Malan without much threat. He then switched to around the wicket, which most bowlers struggle to do effectively, but Bumrah can switch seamlessly [00:11:46]. This strategic change led to a "big chop on," smashing the stumps and dismissing Malan [00:13:12].
    *   **Wicket of Joe Root:** Bumrah explicitly requested a second slip, indicating his plan to bowl a back-of-a-length delivery outside off-stump, aiming for Root to push at it and be caught [00:13:38]. This public declaration of intent served to "prime" Root [00:14:22]. However, instead of the expected length, Bumrah bowled a full and straight delivery that rushed Root, leading to his dismissal [00:14:31]. This tactic of priming a batter for one type of ball and then delivering another is effective, especially for bowlers like Bumrah with unique actions and natural pace [00:15:15].
*   **Kuldeep Yadav:** Kuldeep's improved bowling since 2019 has been a "huge part" of India's success in taking wickets [01:17:12]. His ability to vary spin by changing how the ball is held in his fingers, allowing it to hit the seam or smooth side differently, contributes to variation even with the same revolutions [00:48:50].
*   **Ravindra Jadeja:** His bowling has also contributed to wickets in this tournament [01:17:21].
*   **Mohammed Siraj:** His performance has been somewhat inconsistent ("hotter and colder") [01:16:13].

### Batting
India reached 229 runs [00:01:19]. Their batting average in the tournament, even with a "failing" performance in this match, is over 50 runs per wicket, similar to New Zealand and South Africa [00:16:33]. India's ability to score over 200 runs despite losing wickets and facing challenging bowling and conditions is a testament to their strength [00:19:33].

*   **Rohit Sharma:** Played another "very good innings" [00:19:16].
*   **Suryakumar Yadav (Sky):** Played very well at the end [00:27:28]. His ODI average is significantly lower than his List A average, which is surprising given his improvement later in his career [00:20:41]. This discrepancy is partly attributed to a lack of List A cricket since 2018, preventing him from developing his one-day game while smashing the ball in T20 cricket [00:22:28]. His recent struggles in ODI cricket are considered "dumb luck" rather than a lack of talent [00:22:56]. His innings in this match, when India was in trouble, was a different kind of knock for him, requiring him to bat with the tail, which was impressive [00:23:24].
*   **KL Rahul:** Contributed with a "smaller cameo" [00:01:18] and did what was needed, though his dismissal was "a little bit annoying" [00:19:21].
*   **Virat Kohli:** Analysis shows that he struggles against left-arm seam bowling early in the innings, averaging around 30 in the first 10 overs compared to closer to 50 against right-arm seam. This pattern is unusual, as batters typically improve throughout an innings [00:23:53].

### Strategic Considerations
India's team has significant flexibility due to its all-rounders, Hardik Pandya and Ravindra Jadeja, who are both of high quality [00:36:44]. The emergence of Mohammed Shami as a potent wicket-taker, in addition to Jasprit Bumrah, gives India "the best strike bowling team that has ever existed in one day cricket" [00:38:39]. This strength might allow them to consider playing three fast bowlers with Kuldeep Yadav and Hardik Pandya, potentially at the expense of Mohammed Siraj or Suryakumar Yadav, depending on conditions [00:37:37].

## Broader World Cup Observations

The [[cricket_world_cup_2023_analysis | Cricket World Cup 2023]] has been characterized by "wicket-taking" pitches, with seam bowlers taking many wickets [00:16:58]. While off-spinners have struggled to take wickets, left-arm finger spinners are getting some, and leg-spinners are also struggling [00:17:18]. India has been tested in matches against [[india_vs_new_zealand_odi_analysis | New Zealand]] and Australia, but their ability to handle various challenges (new ball movement, left-arm seamers, quality spin, proper quicks) has been evident [00:18:13]. This resilience, even when their batting lineup doesn't fire as expected, allows them confidence if they have to set a smaller target in knockout games [00:20:00].

England's current performance is likened to Afghanistan's role in previous World Cups â€“ putting pressure on good teams without challenging for victory [00:18:50]. Currently, Afghanistan is considered "better than England" in this World Cup [00:19:01].

Prediction for semi-finalists remains India, South Africa, New Zealand, and Australia [00:56:54].

The upcoming three-match Test series between New Zealand and India is set to take place in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>. The general consensus is that India are overwhelming favorites, with little to no chance for New Zealand to win a single Test match, let alone the series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. The most likely outcome predicted is a 3-0 series victory for India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:58:00">[28:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:05:00">[32:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:45:00">[32:45:00]</a>.

## Team Strength Comparison

Compared to their last tour of India two or three years prior, New Zealand are perceived to have a weaker team now, while India's team has improved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. India's home record is formidable, having not lost a Test series at home since England in 2012, and only four games since then <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>.

### New Zealand's Chances
New Zealand's only "favor" in the series might be the forecast rain in Bengaluru, where the first Test is taking place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. However, India's recent form suggests they can win a Test match in as little as two days, even with rain interruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. For New Zealand to win a game, many factors would need to align perfectly: their in-form players would need to perform, their batters would need to make substantial runs (e.g., 320-330 after bowling India out cheaply), and their spin trio/quartet would need to be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:05:00">[30:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:30:00">[30:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:30:00">[30:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:33:00">[30:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:38:00">[30:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:41:00">[30:41:00]</a>. Even with all these conditions met, the chance of winning a single game is estimated at around 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:49:00">[30:49:00]</a>.

## New Zealand Squad and Leadership

### Batting
Several New Zealand players have experienced recent form drop-offs, including Tim Southee, Devon Conway, Tom Blundell, and Daryl Mitchell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. The batting lineup, while not "terrible," is currently out of form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>. Kane Williamson is not playing the first Test due to a groin injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:12:00">[31:12:00]</a>. His absence is significant despite his average of 33.5 in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:00">[13:51:00]</a>.

New Zealand's team also features a number of left-handed batters, including Tom Latham, Devon Conway, Rachin Ravindra, Michael Bracewell, Mitchell Santner, and Mark Chapman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:00">[14:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:08:00">[14:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:00">[14:10:00]</a>. This could be an issue if the surfaces rag (turn sharply), especially on days four and five <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:00">[14:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20:00">[14:20:00]</a>.

### Bowling
New Zealand's spin options include Ajaz Patel, who is good in Indian conditions but may be India's sixth or eighth best spinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>, and is expected to start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>. Mitchell Santner was not impressive against Sri Lanka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:00">[10:34:00]</a>. Michael Bracewell might play a Test or two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a> and offers extra batting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44:00">[11:44:00]</a>. Ish Sodhi is available for the second and third Tests but not the first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>. Glenn Phillips is a potential spin bowling option used frequently in Test Cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>, and can be a "bonus utility player" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:19:00">[30:19:00]</a>. Rachin Ravindra's bowling might hold up well, especially suited to Indian pitches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>.

In terms of pace, William O'Rourke impressed with his bounce in Galle, Sri Lanka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>, and is seen as a potential flat-pitch bowler for New Zealand in this series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>. He has a bowling average of 19.78 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:38:00">[18:38:00]</a>, though nine of his 19 wickets came against South Africa's "D" team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:53:00">[31:53:00]</a>. Matt Henry is not particularly suited to Indian conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.

### Captaincy Change
Tim Southee recently resigned as captain of New Zealand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>, having captained in 14 Test matches with 35 wickets at an average of 39 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. He is no longer an automatic pick for the India Tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>. Tom Latham has replaced him as skipper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>. Latham has frequently served as a makeshift captain and is generally a good player of spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>. However, he is viewed more as a "vice-captain" type rather than a full-time leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>. The leadership change is not expected to have a huge impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a>.

## India's Squad and Strategy

India's most significant advantage lies in their spin bowling resources, boasting players like Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, and Kuldeep Yadav, among others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>. These bowlers are considered "top brass" in home conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>, creating a complete mismatch with New Zealand's spin options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>.

### Player Availability and Rest
Most of the Indian side is available for the series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>. Jasprit Bumrah is a key player, and while he played the second Test against Bangladesh, there's discussion about how many of the three Tests he should play before the [[india_vs_australia_test_cricket_analysis | Border-Gavaskar Trophy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:21:00">[16:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:29:00">[16:29:00]</a>. Given that Rohit Sharma is unavailable for the first Test against Australia, Bumrah is a strong candidate to captain and may want to play the majority of the New Zealand series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:59:00">[16:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:03:00">[17:03:00]</a>. Ideally, India would rest him completely if they felt they didn't need him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:49:00">[16:49:00]</a>.

Mohammad Shami's unavailability is an issue, as resting Bumrah would be easier if Shami were available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:16:00">[18:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:18:00">[18:18:00]</a>. The current pace attack includes Akash Deep and Mohammed Siraj <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:46:00">[17:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:49:00">[17:49:00]</a>. Siraj is a rhythm bowler, and Akash Deep is very new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:03:00">[18:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:06:00">[18:06:00]</a>. This could be an area New Zealand might exploit if Bumrah is absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:10:00">[18:10:00]</a>.

### Pitch Conditions
There's a hope that "doctored pitches" are a thing of the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:20:00">[19:20:00]</a>. A fair pitch can still turn from day three or four, which is considered acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:27:00">[19:27:00]</a>. Historically, India has made pitches that were either fine or horrendous, sometimes to manage the workload of their spinners like Ashwin and Jadeja <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:41:00">[19:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:54:00">[19:54:00]</a>. On flat pitches, India's spinners (Ashwin, Jadeja, Axar Patel) are expected to outperform opposition spinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:17:00">[21:17:00]</a>. India is unlikely to want long Test matches, aiming for three-and-a-half to four-day finishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:17:00">[21:17:00]</a>.

## Predictions

*   **Series Score:** India to win 3-0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:58:00">[28:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:45:00">[32:45:00]</a>.
*   **Leading Wicket Taker:** Ravichandran Ashwin, especially given New Zealand's left-handed batters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:07:00">[33:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:09:00">[33:09:00]</a>. Ajaz Patel is also a possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:55:00">[32:55:00]</a>.
*   **Leading Run Scorer:** Yashasvi Jaiswal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:47:00">[34:47:00]</a>.

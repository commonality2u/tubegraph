The Indian cricket team has showcased unprecedented dominance in One Day International (ODI) cricket, particularly highlighted by their performance leading up to and during the World Cup. Their commanding form has led many to consider them a formidable force, akin to some of the greatest teams in the sport's history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:26">[02:06:26]</a>.

## Unprecedented Performance and Unbeaten Streak
India entered the World Cup final with an impressive 10-0 record, marking their longest-ever winning streak in ODI Cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>. This "relentless" and "complete team" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:22">[02:03:22]</a> has been compared to dominant sides such as the 2003 and 2007 Australian teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:06">[02:07:06]</a>. While not "entirely invincible," their 10-0 record certainly suggests so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:09">[02:17:09]</a>.

## Bowling Prowess
A significant factor in India's dominance has been their potent bowling attack, particularly the emergence of [[Indias bowling strategies and performance | Mohammed Shami]].

### Mohammed Shami's Impact
Despite starting the tournament on the bench <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:02">[00:56:02]</a>, Shami became India's main strike force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:38">[00:54:38]</a>. His performance in the World Cup semi-final, taking 7 for 57, was exceptional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:17">[00:54:17]</a>. His statistics are staggering: 23 wickets at an average of 9, striking at better than once every 11 deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:21">[00:54:21]</a>. With 54 wickets in 17 innings, he is the quickest to that landmark in World Cup history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:31">[00:54:31]</a>. He holds the best-ever strike rate in ODI history for bowlers with a minimum of 120 wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:51">[00:54:51]</a>.

The decision to play three quicks, including Shami, despite Indian conditions typically favouring spinners, was a "brave" and successful strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:14">[00:56:14]</a>. Shami's ability to move the ball, even without the new ball, sets him apart from many other bowlers who struggle outside the initial overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:14">[00:58:14]</a>. His effectiveness is further enhanced by the pressure built by Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:57">[00:58:57]</a>.

## Batting Strength
India's batting lineup is also a cornerstone of their dominance. All of India's top five batsmen have a career ODI average of 49 or higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:57">[01:02:57]</a>. Among Indian batters with a minimum of 2,000 runs in ODI Cricket, five of the top six play in the current team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>, a fact described as "unprecedented" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:17">[01:03:17]</a>.

### Complementary Roles
The success of the batting order stems from the complementary roles played by each batsman:
*   **Rohit Sharma's Evolution**: Over the last two years, Rohit Sharma has prioritized power play hitting over run accumulation, providing quick starts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:25">[01:07:25]</a>.
*   **Shubman Gill's Calculated Aggression**: Gill's "risk-free" stroke play allows for consistent scoring even when it doesn't appear explosive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:43">[01:07:43]</a>.
*   **Virat Kohli's Anchoring**: The aggressive starts from Rohit and Gill allow Virat Kohli to anchor the innings and shift into "cruise control" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:58">[01:07:58]</a>. Kohli's 50th ODI century at the Wankhede Stadium was a significant World Cup moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:03">[01:08:03]</a>.
*   **Shreyas Iyer's Impact**: Iyer's ability to accelerate and hit straight sixes has been crucial, especially considering doubts about his position at number four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:20">[01:09:20]</a>. His consecutive centuries and four consecutive scores of 50+ in the tournament have significantly boosted the team's average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:16">[01:10:16]</a>.
*   **Depth**: The batting lineup's varied skill sets, from aggressive openers to anchor batsmen and powerful finishers, make it difficult for opposition teams to break through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:11">[01:05:11]</a>.

## Comparisons and Future Outlook
India's current team is considered to be in an "S-tier" of performance, above other strong teams like Australia and New Zealand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:06">[01:44:06]</a>. The consistently strong performances of India, Australia, and England in 50-over World Cups over the past decade underscore the importance of resources and solid cricketing structures in producing quality players and providing exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:0:00">[01:33:06]</a>.

Despite a loss in the World Test Championship final against Australia, the idea of India having a "mental block" against Australia in white-ball cricket is disputed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. India's superior record in recent head-to-head matches (13 wins to Australia's 10 in 25 games across all formats) suggests otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:55">[01:01:55]</a>.

The team faces immense pressure to secure an ICC trophy, having not won one since the 2013 Champions Trophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:10">[01:24:10]</a>. Although they are widely regarded as the best team and deserve to win the World Cup, the nature of knockout cricket means a loss is always a possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:16">[01:24:16]</a>. However, the current Indian squad exhibits a level of completeness and skill that leaves "no real frailty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:53">[01:22:53]</a>, making them strong contenders for the title.

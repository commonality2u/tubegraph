India's dominance in recent ICC tournaments, reaching the finals of the last four consecutive ICC trophies – the 2023 ICC World Test Championship, the ODI World Cup, the T20 World Cup, and now an ICC ODI final (their third Champions Trophy final) – highlights the significant contributions of its key players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. The team has consistently outperformed others in bilaterals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Batting Contributions

The hallmark of India's batting innings, particularly in their victory over Australia, was their exceptional strike rotation and ability to take countless singles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### [[role_and_impact_of_key_players_in_the_match | Virat Kohli]]
[[role_and_impact_of_key_players_in_the_match | Virat Kohli]] has been a master of the chase for India across formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>. In the semi-final against Australia, he was named Player of the Match for his 84 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>, his 15th Player of the Match award in ICC events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>. His innings featured only five boundaries, with the majority of his runs coming from singles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. [[role_and_impact_of_key_players_in_the_match | Kohli]] holds the record for most singles in ODIs since January 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>. In his last six ICC knockout games across limited overs formats, he has scored 50-plus in five <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>, rewriting the narrative of him "choking" in big games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>. He is a brilliant strike rotator who doesn't get stuck, allowing him to put pressure on the opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>. [[role_and_impact_of_key_players_in_the_match | Kohli]] is exceptionally good at finding gaps, whether tucking away straight balls, driving fuller deliveries, or guiding balls outside off stump to third man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>. With over 8,000 runs in chases alone, averaging close to 65, he is well-placed to handle any target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>.

### Rohit Sharma
As captain, [[role_of_players_leadership_and_strategy_in_ipl | Rohit Sharma]] has led India to four consecutive ICC finals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>, becoming the only individual to achieve this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:24">[00:33:24]</a>. Despite criticism of his captaincy, he deserves significant credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>. In the semi-final, he was dismissed by Cooper Connelly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a> after being dropped twice by Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. His quickfire 30s and 40s in Dubai's conditions are often sufficient for India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:29">[00:32:29]</a>. He contributed significantly to India's 50-plus score in the powerplay, which was crucial for their chase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:14">[00:32:14]</a>.

### Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul
[[role_and_impact_of_key_players_in_the_match | Shreyas Iyer]] demonstrated excellent strike rotation during his knock of 45 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>. [[role_and_impact_of_key_players_in_the_match | KL Rahul]] remained unbeaten on 42, playing an exceptional role towards the end of the innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>. He also hit crucial big shots, including a six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>.

### Hardik Pandya
[[importance_of_allrounders_in_indias_odi_team | Hardik Pandya]], though not focused on strike rotation, delivered three massive sixes to seal the game for India when it got tense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>.

### Axar Patel
Axar Patel is consistently batting at number five, establishing his role as a floater in the ODI team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a>.

## Bowling Performance

### [[indias_bowling_strategies_and_performance | Mohammad Shami]]
[[indias_bowling_strategies_and_performance | Mohammad Shami]] delivered a strong performance with 3 for 48, making him the most successful bowler for India in the semi-final <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>. He bowled well with the new ball, making it difficult for the Australian batters to connect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>. He also secured the crucial wicket of Steve Smith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:05">[00:34:05]</a>.

### [[role_of_spinners_and_seamers_in_indias_cricket_success | Ravindra Jadeja]]
[[role_of_spinners_and_seamers_in_indias_cricket_success | Ravindra Jadeja]]'s double breakthrough was particularly crucial for India, significantly impacting Australia's innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>. His performance has been strong, even stealing wickets despite other bowlers also performing well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:56">[00:34:56]</a>. While the pitch against New Zealand was favorable for him, he still performed well in the semi-final despite the conditions being less conducive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:03">[00:35:03]</a>.

### [[indias_spin_strategy_and_team_selection | Kuldeep Yadav]]
[[indias_spin_strategy_and_team_selection | Kuldeep Yadav]], despite not getting wickets, maintained an acceptable economy rate of 5.5 runs per over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>. There is speculation that he might be bowling a bit slower and not be fully fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:40">[00:35:40]</a>. He performed well even when bowling in the powerplay, a phase where he typically doesn't bowl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a>. Wrist spinners like [[indias_spin_strategy_and_team_selection | Kuldeep Yadav]] generally struggled more on this wicket compared to finger spinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>.

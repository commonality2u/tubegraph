This achievement occurred recently, just a few moments before the podcast discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>.

## Historical Context and Significance

Prior to this series, [[challenges_for_bangladeshs_cricket_team | Bangladesh]] had never defeated Pakistan in a single Test match across 13 attempts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>. Furthermore, out of 65 away Tests played before this series, they had only managed to win six, with 32 losses by an innings margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>. The 2-0 series win was thus seen as a massive effort and a significant moment in [[bangladeshs_challenges_in_test_cricket | Bangladesh's cricket history]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>.

The victory gained additional context due to ongoing unrest and a "revolution" within Bangladesh, which could have mentally impacted the players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>. The floods in Bangladesh also added to the context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>. The emotional and historical relationship between the two nations made this win even more impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>.

This series is hoped to be a starting point for [[performance_analysis_of_bangladesh_cricket_team | Bangladesh]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>, similar to how other [[important_test_series_victories_in_cricket_history | important Test series victories]] have defined cricket for nations in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>.

## Key Performances and Match Details

[[performance_analysis_of_bangladesh_cricket_team | Bangladesh]] comprehensively outplayed Pakistan across all three departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>.

Notable individual performances included:
*   **Liton Das:** Scored 138 runs despite being injured midway through the series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>.
*   **Mehidy Hasan Miraz:** Contributed with two half-centuries, totaling 155 runs at an average of 77.5, and took 10 wickets at under 19 runs a piece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>.

In the second Test, [[performance_analysis_of_bangladesh_cricket_team | Bangladesh]] made a remarkable comeback from 26 for 6 to win the match, showcasing a complete team performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>. They won the second Test in just three days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. Even in the first Test, Pakistan declared at 448 for 6, but [[performance_analysis_of_bangladesh_cricket_team | Bangladesh]] played traditional, old-school Test cricket to win the match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>.

### Bowling Performance

[[bangladesh_bowling_performance_and_strategies | Bangladesh's fast bowlers]] also played a significant role, with players like Nahid Rana, Hasan Mahmud, Taskin, and Shoriful rattling Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:10">[00:46:10]</a>.

## Comparison and Future Outlook

The victory has been compared to other significant upsets in Test history, such as [[sri_lankas_famous_away_test_series_wins | Sri Lanka's 2-0 clean sweep against South Africa in 2019]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>, where Sri Lanka were not highly expected to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. Unlike some wins that hinge on one exceptional individual performance, such as Kusal Perera's innings for Sri Lanka in South Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>, [[performance_analysis_of_bangladesh_cricket_team | Bangladesh's win]] was a collective effort from the entire team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:19">[00:25:19]</a>.

Chandika Hathurusingha was the coach for [[sri_lankas_famous_away_test_series_wins | Sri Lanka's 2019 win against South Africa]] and also during this [[india_vs_bangladesh_test_series_review | Pakistan-Bangladesh series]], with suggestions that his coaching performance improves when he is under pressure of being sacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

This series holds significant importance as a potential turning point for [[bangladeshs_challenges_in_test_cricket | Bangladesh]] in Test cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>, with hopes that it will define their future in the format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>.

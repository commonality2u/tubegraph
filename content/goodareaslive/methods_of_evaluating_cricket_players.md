Evaluating [[cricket and player performances | cricket player performances]] is a complex and often subjective process, especially when considering players whose impact on the game might transcend their statistical records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:18">[01:22:18]</a>. Traditional cricket media once relied on simple sources like newspapers and [[cricket_and_player_performances | cricketing statistics]] websites like Cricinfo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, modern evaluation often involves deeper analysis and subjective interpretation.

## Podcast Evaluation Format

The "Crick Picks" podcast employs a unique method for [[criteria_for_ranking_cricket_players | evaluating current cricket players across formats]] and [[assessing_the_performance_and_style_of_specific_cricket_players | assessing the performance and style of specific cricket players]]. In each episode, the hosts select a generic cricket category and then draft their top five players for that category in a snake-style draft competition, where the pick order reverses each round (1-2-3, then 3-2-1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.

## Focus: Players Better Than Their Numbers

One specific category explored was "cricketers who were basically better than their numbers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:42">[01:17:42]</a>. This topic is inherently vague, broad, and subjective, with "no right answers, only wrong answers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. The hosts revealed different perspectives on this category:
*   Some hosts focused on players who had significant potential but did not fully realize it, leading to records that don't reflect their true capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:09">[01:49:09]</a>.
*   Others selected players whose on-field impact and perceived quality were undeniably higher than what their raw statistics suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:39">[01:54:39]</a>.
*   A third approach involved picking players from historical eras whose numbers, while good for their time, are not recognized as such in modern [[criteria_for_ranking_cricket_players | cricketing metrics]], causing them to be overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:49">[02:08:49]</a>.

## Player Examples and Evaluation Rationales

### Freddie Flintoff
[[evaluating_cricket_allrounders_using_statistics_and_impact | All-rounder]] Freddie Flintoff was regarded as "magic" and "box office" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>, especially during the 2005 and 2009 Ashes series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. Despite his Test batting average of 31.77 and bowling average of 32.78, and ODI batting average of 32 with a bowling average of 24.38 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>, he was believed to have a much higher ceiling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. Factors like numerous injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a> and a perceived incorrect bowling length during his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a> prevented him from achieving a better statistical record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.

### Aravinda de Silva
Despite a Test average of 43 from over 6,000 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>, Aravinda de Silva is widely considered by many great Sri Lankan cricketers to be the best batter from Sri Lanka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. Even modern greats like Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene admitted he was a better player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. His exceptional talent, particularly during the 1996 World Cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a> and certain overseas tours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>, was undeniable, even if he couldn't maintain motivation daily like others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>. He played in a tougher batting era compared to later players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>.

### WG Grace
WG Grace's Test average in the low 30s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a> is often misconstrued in modern terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>. For his era, these numbers were "outstanding" and "fantastic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. He was a dominant player who continued to excel even when he was well past his prime and playing Test cricket as a doctor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>, rather than a full-time professional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>.

### Graeme Gooch
Graeme Gooch is an example of a player whose full game developed later in his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>, resulting in an "unimpressive" overall batting average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>. However, he was "one of the greatest players of all time over the age of 30" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a> and had incredible innings against formidable West Indies teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59:00">[08:59:00]</a>. Despite the debate, some consider him among the top five batters of all time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a>.

### Mohammad Amir
Despite a decent record (averaging 28 across formats) with 119 wickets in Tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:00]</a>, Mohammad Amir is seen as a player who did not fulfill his potential due to missing five peak years because of his involvement in fixing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>. He could have been "one of the best ever in the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>.

### Learie Constantine
Baron Learie Constantine was an influential [[cricketing_roles_and_player_performance_assessment | all-rounder]] and one of the biggest stars from the Caribbean in his era, crucial in the West Indies' first victory over England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>. He was an "electric fielder, very quick bowler, and belligerent batter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>, comparable to Andre Russell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a>. However, his Test numbers were "very, very substandard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:00">[13:01:00]</a>: 635 runs at 19.24 and 58 wickets at 30.10 in 18 Tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:04:00">[13:04:00]</a>. His impact and reputation far exceeded these figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56:00">[13:56:00]</a>.

### Moeen Ali
Moeen Ali was a versatile "plug and chug" player for England, consistently filling gaps without a fixed batting position or role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:21:00">[14:21:00]</a>. His statistics (Test batting average 28, ODI batting average 24, T20 batting average 21; Test bowling average 37, ODI 48, T20 27) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:36:00">[14:36:00]</a> do not reflect his immense impact and balance he provided to the team, including being a World Cup winner in T20 and ODI cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a>. He is seen as a "poster child" for all-rounders whose careers are often judged as "legend or loser" with no middle ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:35:00">[15:35:00]</a>.

### Carl Hooper
Carl Hooper's statistics (Test average 36, ODI average 35) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:39:00">[16:39:00]</a> are considered underwhelming for his talent, particularly as a batter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47:00">[16:47:00]</a>. Like Aravinda de Silva, when he decided to bat, he was "absolutely remarkable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:14:00">[17:14:00]</a>, but he did not always perform to his full potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:17:00">[17:17:00]</a>. His bowling average of 45-50 also suggests he "never got the most out of himself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:38:00">[17:38:00]</a>.

### Daryl Cullinan
Daryl Cullinan was seen as a "top, top level player" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:19:00">[18:19:00]</a> who played in an "incredibly tough era" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:22:00">[18:22:00]</a> where player averages were generally depressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:27:00">[18:27:00]</a>. His career was significantly impacted by his inability to pick Shane Warne's bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:31:00">[18:31:00]</a>. His perceived average was a 50 in Tests, but he ended up with 44 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:49:00">[20:49:00]</a>.

### Daniel Vettori
Daniel Vettori is highlighted as a player whose impact was greater than his statistics, especially given his role as a spinner in New Zealand conditions that typically favor fast bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:07:00">[19:07:00]</a>. His Test batting average of 30 was considered "quite good for his role" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:41:00">[19:41:00]</a>, but his bowling average of 34.36 (Tests) and 34.23 (ODIs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:57:00">[19:57:00]</a> does not fully reflect his consistent performance and importance to the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:15:00">[20:15:00]</a>. He was often "bowled to death" and likely picked earlier than he should have been due to a lack of other spinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:28:00">[19:28:00]</a>.

### Mark Waugh
Mark Waugh, despite Test and ODI averages of 41 and 39 respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:50:00">[21:50:00]</a>, was considered a "genius with the bat" and a "much more talented" and "stylish" player than his record suggests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:44:00">[21:44:00]</a>. His relatively low top score for a player of his caliber (153 in Tests) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:42:00">[22:42:00]</a> indicates he often failed to convert hundreds into larger scores. Like many players of his era, his averages were "a little bit depressed" because they played before the "ridiculously high" averages of the subsequent batting era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:56:00">[22:56:00]</a>.

### Mark Ramprakash
Mark Ramprakash had a remarkable first-class average of 53.14 with 114 centuries in 461 games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:31:00">[24:31:00]</a>. However, this talent did not translate to Test cricket, where he averaged only 27.32 in 52 games with two centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:40:00">[24:40:00]</a>, a "complete mismatch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:49:00">[24:49:00]</a>. He was described as one of the best batters seen live, with incredible control and a unique approach to batting, such as maximizing runs in overs before breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:26:00">[25:26:00]</a>.

### Imran Nazir
Imran Nazir was a "Livewire" batter and fielder, perceived as Pakistan's answer to Chris Gayle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:43:00">[26:43:00]</a>. His averages (Test: 32.84, ODI: 24.60, T20: 22.09) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:01:00">[27:01:00]</a> don't reflect his explosive talent, especially considering he played before the peak of T20 cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:56:00">[26:56:00]</a>. He was the best batter in leagues like the ICL, suggesting he was "better than those numbers suggest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:33:00">[27:33:00]</a>.

### Yuvraj Singh
Yuvraj Singh, while achieving a lot in his career, was touted as the "next big thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:12:00">[28:12:00]</a>. His limited-overs numbers (ODI average 36, T20 average 28) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:22:00">[28:22:00]</a>, and especially his Test average of 34 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:56:00">[28:56:00]</a>, do not fully reflect his talent, particularly as he played in an era where "everyone was making runs" and even "ordinary players are averaging over 40" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:05:00">[29:05:00]</a>. His left-arm spin was also considered "not bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:46:00">[28:46:00]</a>.

### Clem Hill
Clem Hill, arguably the "first great left-hander" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:26:00">[29:26:00]</a> with an "incredible strike rate," is often overlooked in discussions of great batters because he played in the same era as Victor Trumper and his average of 39.43 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:43:00">[29:43:00]</a> is "just the wrong side of that number" for modern remembrance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:23:00">[30:23:00]</a>. Despite possibly being an "ugly batter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:37:00">[29:37:00]</a>, he was an "absolute incredible player" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:03:00">[30:03:00]</a>.

## Conclusion on Evaluation Methods

The discussion highlights that player [[cricket_and_player_performances | evaluation]] goes beyond mere statistics, considering factors like potential, impact, playing era, roles within the team, and external influences like injuries or specific matchups. The "Crick Picks" format demonstrates how subjective interpretations and differing criteria can lead to varied but equally valid assessments of a player's true worth to the game.

Other players mentioned as potentially fitting this category include K.L. Rahul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:59:00">[30:59:00]</a>, Graham Hick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:02:00">[31:02:00]</a>, Adrien Barath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:42:00">[31:42:00]</a>, Aiden Markram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:46:00">[31:46:00]</a>, Ben Stokes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:50:00">[31:50:00]</a>, Mohammad Ashraful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:58:00">[31:58:00]</a>, Steven Fleming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:20:00">[32:20:00]</a>, and Martin Crowe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:28:00">[32:28:00]</a>.

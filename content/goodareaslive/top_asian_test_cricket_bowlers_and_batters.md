## Top Asian Test Batters

### Kusal Mendis (Sri Lanka)
Kusal Mendis was the first pick in the draft due to his exceptional [[recent_performances_of_asian_cricket_players | current form]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.
*   He has scored 943 runs in seven tests in "this year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.
*   He averages 94.3 in "this year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.
*   He reached 1,000 runs in eight test matches, a record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.
*   His average is 91.27 so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.
*   He has five centuries in eight test matches, including one in England, indicating he is an all-conditions batter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.
*   Mendis can bat anywhere from numbers 4 to 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. He was initially placed at six but could move to four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a>.

### Yashasvi Jaiswal (India)
Selected as an opener, Yashasvi Jaiswal averages over 56 in 14 test matches, despite being new to the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>. He is considered aesthetically pleasing to watch and a left-hander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. He is seen as someone who will score a lot of runs for India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>.

### Rishabh Pant (India)
Despite recent team struggles, Rishabh Pant was a "beacon of hope" for India, consistently scoring runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>. He is considered a match-winner who has been magnificent since returning from a prolonged injury break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>.

### Saud Shakeel (Pakistan)
Saud Shakeel was picked to bat at number five <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:00">[10:38:00]</a>. He has made "a million runs" in the last couple of years, at a time when many Asian batters haven't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>. While there are concerns about his performance when traveling, he is comfortable batting against spinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:00">[10:43:00]</a>.

### Salman Ali Agha (Pakistan)
Salman Ali Agha was chosen as a "completely biased pick" but with supporting numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">[12:22:00]</a>. He has had a terrific year since his series against Sri Lanka, scoring consistent runs and often bailing out Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a>. He is strong against spin and improving against pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:00">[12:34:00]</a>. He averages 46 runs with the bat in 17 test matches, which is currently higher than Babar Azam's average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:00">[12:44:00]</a>. He is considered a solid option, potentially for the 12th man spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>.

### Shubman Gill (India)
Shubman Gill was selected to bat at first drop (number three) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>. He averages 47.4 in "this calendar year" in Test cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>. Despite previous criticism, he is now considered one of India's most in-form batters alongside Rishabh Pant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:00">[13:40:00]</a>.

### Dimuth Karunaratne (Sri Lanka)
Dimuth Karunaratne was chosen as an opener <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:27:00">[14:27:00]</a>. He has been one of the top four opening batters over the last six or seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:42:00">[14:42:00]</a>. In the last 24 test matches, he has made almost 2,000 runs at an average of 40, with four centuries and 13 fifties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>. Although he has no centuries this year, he is considered a safe pick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:52:00">[14:52:00]</a>.

### Other Batting Mentions
*   **Pathum Nissanka (Sri Lanka):** Considered a tempting option, potentially a future top opener if he had consistently played Test cricket, but has been protected due to a back injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:36:00">[15:36:00]</a>.
*   **Rahmat Shah (Afghanistan):** Averages 32 in Test cricket batting at number three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:42:00">[16:42:00]</a>.
*   **Hashmatullah Shahidi (Afghanistan):** Averages 44 from eight games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:54:00">[16:54:00]</a>.

*   **Angelo Matthews (Sri Lanka):** Has made a lot of runs in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:33:00">[23:33:00]</a>.
*   **Mohammad Rizwan (Pakistan):** Was considered the only option from Pakistan for a guaranteed spot in the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>.

### Asitha Fernando (Sri Lanka)
Asitha Fernando is considered the second-best fast bowler in Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>.

### Other Bowling Mentions
*   **Muhammad Shami (India):** Discussed as a potential pick if fit and available, with an opinion that he might be playing the Border-Gavaskar Trophy ahead of others if available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>. It's noted he's not currently available for Test selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:29:00">[20:29:00]</a>.
*   **Taskin Ahmed (Bangladesh):** Considered a good option, especially as he has found another level recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:51:00">[19:51:00]</a>.
*   **Nahid Rana (Bangladesh):** A "new speed demon" from Bangladesh, but his numbers in Test cricket don't currently support his inclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:26:00">[19:26:00]</a>.

## Drafting Process Insights

The criteria for the [[drafting_a_current_asian_test_cricket_team]] heavily relied on [[recent_performances_of_asian_cricket_players | current form]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. The hosts noted the difficulty in finding top-order batters currently in form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:50:00">[22:50:00]</a>. Many teams, including Bangladesh, have strengths in the middle order, which often overlaps with India's strong middle-order options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:25:00">[22:25:00]</a>. The discussion touched upon the challenge of including a proportionate number of Indian players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.

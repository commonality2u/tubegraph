The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has recently brought in experienced former players to serve as mentors, aiming to instill professionalism and consistency within the cricket system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This initiative seeks to address historical issues within Pakistan cricket, including frequent changes in leadership and a perceived [[professionalism_in_cricket | lack of professionalism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## The Mentor Role at PCB

Shoaib Malik, a former Pakistan captain, has joined the PCB as a mentor for one of the domestic teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This role is distinct from typical franchise cricket mentorship, which often involves simply sitting on the bench or giving inspiring speeches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:05">[03:13:05]</a>. The PCB mentor role is comprehensive and hands-on, involving a three-year contract and a commitment to work 240 days a year at high-performance centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:05">[05:34:05]</a>.

Mentors are expected to be deeply involved in various aspects of player development:
*   **Coaching and Tactics** The role extends beyond traditional mentoring to include elements of coaching and [[strategy_and_decisionmaking_in_cricket | tactics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.
*   **Player Selection** Mentors have been given the authority to select their own staff, including spin bowling coaches, pace bowling coaches, physios, and trainers, alongside a head coach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.
*   **Grooming and Professionalism** A primary focus is to groom players and equip them with the professionalism needed for top-level cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>. This includes educating them on recovery, diet, training schedules, and general discipline required to be consistent athletes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>.
*   **Player Development** Mentors are involved in the development of players across different levels, including men's, women's, and Under-19 teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>.

The five current mentors, including Shoaib Malik, Younis Khan, Misbah-ul-Haq, and Sarfaraz Ahmed, have all captained the Pakistan cricket team, providing them with significant authority and experience in their new roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.

## Addressing Pakistan Cricket's Challenges

### Instilling Professionalism
Pakistan has a wealth of talent but struggles with consistency and matching that talent with professionalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>. The new mentor system aims to rectify this by focusing on comprehensive player development, emphasizing hard work and work ethics over raw talent alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>. An example given is Younis Khan, who, despite not being as naturally talented as some other Pakistani cricketers, scored over 10,000 Test runs due to his strong work ethic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>.

### Domestic Structure and Workload Management
The PCB has introduced Champions tournaments to bridge the gap between national and domestic cricketers and foster professionalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>. Future plans include reducing the number of domestic tournaments to allow players adequate rest and time for development beyond skill, ensuring they are not "on their toes 24/7" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:08:00">[16:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:38:00">[16:38:00]</a>.

### Clarity and Continuity
Frequent changes in PCB leadership, selectors, and coaches have historically led to a lack of clarity and inconsistent results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. The mentors emphasize the need for continuity in structures and plans for at least a few years to allow results to materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:51:00">[20:51:00]</a>. They also advocate for clear communication from the PCB to both players and the public regarding roles and expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:00">[13:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:00]</a>.

### Player Non-Objection Certificates (NOCs)
There is a need for clear policies regarding player participation in international leagues. While players should prioritize domestic cricket, there should be flexibility to allow them to play in other leagues during free windows, without arbitrary limits on NOCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:34:00">[27:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:04:00">[28:04:00]</a>. Shoaib Malik credits his time playing in various leagues for significant personal and professional learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:14:00">[28:14:00]</a>. Denial of NOCs for players not actively playing domestic cricket or for fitness tests in other countries has deterred foreign franchises from picking Pakistani cricketers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:41:00">[30:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:30:00">[31:30:00]</a>.

## Benefits of Cricketers in Administration

Shoaib Malik believes that having more cricketers in PCB setup, especially in director roles, can bring more professionalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:07:00">[36:07:00]</a>. For example, an International Director who is a sensible cricketer can facilitate better communication and decision-making regarding pitch preparation and overall team requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:12:00">[36:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:49:00">[36:49:00]</a>.

The current chairman's open communication with players is seen as a positive step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:37:00">[19:37:00]</a>. The establishment of a clear "point of contact" for mentors and players is crucial for streamlined communication and addressing requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:06:00">[40:06:00]</a>.

### Strategic Player Management
Experienced players can offer insights into player workload management, particularly for fast bowlers who require adequate rest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:04:00">[42:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:18:00">[42:18:00]</a>. They also suggest a mixed approach to international tours, fielding the best team for challenging tours (e.g., Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, England, India) and providing opportunities for newcomers against relatively smaller sides to give them international exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:30:00">[41:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:32:00">[42:32:00]</a>.

### Improving Player Performance: Babar Azam Example
Shoaib Malik's interaction with Babar Azam demonstrates the direct impact of experienced players. Malik advised Babar to adjust his stance against spin bowlers to leg stump to eliminate the leg-before-wicket element and improve his stroke play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:36:00">[43:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:08:00">[44:08:00]</a>. He also suggested adjustments for facing fast bowlers to ensure his back leg movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:55:00">[44:55:00]</a>. Such specific, technical advice, combined with the player's willingness to adapt, highlights the value of former players' insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:47:00">[45:47:00]</a>. Babar Azam's resignation from white-ball captaincy is also seen as a positive, allowing him to focus solely on his batting and winning games for Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:51:00">[48:51:00]</a>. This directly relates to the [[the_impact_of_leadership_changes_in_cricket_teams | impact of leadership changes]] and the [[role_of_players_leadership_and_strategy_in_ipl | role of players' leadership and strategy]].

## Outlook

The involvement of experienced players as comprehensive mentors is a new approach by the PCB to bring consistency and professionalism to Pakistan cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. It requires time, consistency, and a stable team setup within the administration to yield long-term results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.

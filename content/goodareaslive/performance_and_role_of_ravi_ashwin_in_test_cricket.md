Despite earlier questions about whether age was affecting his [[Ravi Chandran Ashwins cricket legacy | performance]], R Ashwin delivered an "absolutely outstanding" [[Performance of R Ashwin and R Jadeja | performance]] in the recent Test match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>. He took wickets from the normal good parts of the pitch by going straight, becoming a "second innings new ball destroyer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. Ashwin looked very "fired up" during the match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>.

## New Ball Bowling Prowess

Ashwin's ability with the new ball is a significant aspect of his game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>.

*   **Against Left-Handers**: In India over the last five years, he averages 16 against left-handed batsmen with the new ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>.
*   **In Third Innings**: His new ball [[Indias Bowling Performance in the Test | bowling]] is particularly effective in the third innings of a match, which "shocked" the speaker with how good it was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>. This scenario allows him to utilize all his skills, including skidding the ball through, inconsistent bounce, and sideways spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>.
*   **Tactical Use**: He is considered one of the first "truly great new ball spinners" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59:00">[08:59:00]</a>.

India's captain, Rohit Sharma, has been observed to "overbowl" his new ball bowlers in this series, especially against Crawley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>. Despite Ashwin's skill, India hasn't always given him the new ball consistently, possibly due to the matchup against Ben Duckett and the presence of Crawley at the other end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>.

## Key Dismissals and Matchups

Ashwin secured crucial wickets in the match:

*   **Ben Duckett**: He dismissed Duckett, who tends to protect his outside edge by getting "slightly inside the ball" while playing forward defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>. Duckett's reverse sweep is humorously noted as potentially better than his defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>. Ashwin is a strong matchup against Duckett, stopping him from scoring and causing issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">[12:22:00]</a>.
*   **Ollie Pope**: Ashwin also dismissed Ollie Pope with a straight ball that, if it had spun "even an inch," would likely have missed the leg stump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>. Pope was in a "bad position" for this straight delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:36:00">[27:36:00]</a>.

## Bowling Trajectory and Efficiency

Ashwin bowled less spin today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>, which indicated his danger as a bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a>. Prior to this match, there was discussion about him being "too old" or "not looking effective," and his bowling average was around 38 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>. However, the speaker didn't observe any "massive signs" of decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>. He had bowled very well towards the end of the third Test after returning from attending to his mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>.

## Complementary Spin Attack

The combination of [[Ravi Chandran Ashwins cricket legacy | Ashwin]], [[Indias Bowling Performance in the Test | Kuldeep Yadav]], and [[Ravi Jadejas batting performance and strategy | Ravindra Jadeja]] provides a strong and varied spin attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:49:00">[58:49:00]</a>. Ashwin's style, which thrives on inconsistent bounce and skidding deliveries, complements [[Ravi Jadejas batting performance and strategy | Ravindra Jadeja's]] preference for sideways ragging on a fresh pitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>. This diversity makes it a very good combination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:49:00">[58:49:00]</a>.

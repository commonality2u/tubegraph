[[Shubman Gills batting techniques against different bowlers | Shubman Gill]] exhibits a peculiar statistical trend in his first-class batting performance, particularly across different innings, which appears to contradict typical expectations for a player who thrives on flat pitches in white-ball [[Cricket and player performances | cricket]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:01">[08:21:01]</a>.

## Innings-by-Innings Analysis

An analysis of [[Shubman Gills batting techniques against different bowlers | Shubman Gill]]'s first-class career reveals a significant disparity in his averages across the four innings of a match:
*   **First Innings:** Averages 37 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:01">[09:13:01]</a>. This is considered "incredibly low," possibly due to the wicket being at its freshest, which might present technical challenges not seen in white-ball [[Cricket and player performances | cricket]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:01">[09:19:01]</a>.
*   **Second Innings:** Averages 51 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:01">[09:30:01]</a>.
*   **Third Innings:** Averages 61 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:01">[09:30:01]</a>. A previous discussion noted many of these runs came in low-pressure situations when India was significantly ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:01">[09:49:01]</a>.
*   **Fourth Innings:** Averages 48 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:01">[09:30:01]</a>. This average likely increased after his recent not-out performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:01">[09:43:01]</a>.

This pattern is highly unusual, as few players show such a substantial difference, particularly performing better as the pitch supposedly gets trickier or has "something going on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:01">[08:16:01]</a>. The technical reason behind this anomaly remains unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:01">[08:31:01]</a>.

## Comparison to Teammates

This unique trend contrasts with other Indian players, whose averages generally decline in later innings:
*   **Jurel:** Averaged 74 in first and second innings, dropping to 40 in the fourth innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:01">[10:29:01]</a>.
*   **Rohit Sharma:** Prior to his recent 50, he had only made one half-century in the fourth innings of first-class matches, despite passing 50 sixty-three times in the first part of games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:01">[11:22:01]</a>. His recent 50 was his new high score in the fourth innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:56:01">[11:56:01]</a>.
*   Other players like [[Cheteshwar Pujaras batting in various conditions | Padar]] and Sarfaraz also show noticeable drops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:01">[10:35:01]</a>.
*   Only Ashwin's average holds up in the fourth innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:01">[10:46:01]</a>.

This suggests that many Indian batters, including senior players, struggle in the fourth innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:01">[11:13:01]</a>.

## Recent Performance and Talent

In a recent match, [[Shubman Gills batting techniques against different bowlers | Shubman Gill]] looked "most assured" on the wicket, even when his teammates like Rohit seemed less permanent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:01">[08:45:01]</a>. His performance in the fourth innings, coupled with Jurel's, despite Jurel's prior lower fourth-innings average, was crucial for India in a high-pressure situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:01">[11:57:01]</a>.

While his test average wasn't initially strong (having played about 25 games), his undeniable talent was always evident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:01">[12:31:01]</a>. His ability to perform in "tricky" or high-pressure situations, as seen in his improved second, third, and fourth innings averages, makes him a valuable asset to the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:01">[08:26:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:01">[12:47:01]</a>. The decision to retain him in the squad proved beneficial for India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:01">[13:08:01]</a>.

The **T20 World Cup 2024** final was described as a "weird and wonderful game of cricket," providing a close contest from beginning to end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. India broke their "hoodoo" in major tournaments against South Africa, who have historically struggled in such events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

## India's Innings

India's innings began with Marco Jansen bowling a "terrible" first over, featuring a wide and a full ball, which put South Africa on the back foot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. Despite this, South Africa fought back, taking three early wickets. Two of these wickets came from poor shots by Indian batsmen, including Rishabh Pant hitting a full toss straight up and Rohit Sharma's shot going directly to a fielder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

South Africa's captain, Aiden Markram, gambled by bowling himself in the sixth over of the power play, which was considered an unusual decision given India's batting lineup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. This indicated South Africa's early confidence. Axar Patel was described as a player who could be either a "pinch blocker or a pinch hitter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.

South Africa's bowlers, including Kagiso Rabada and Marco Jansen, struggled with line and length, often pitching the ball up when it needed to be "banged into the pitch" for the conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>. This allowed batsmen like Shivam Dube to hit boundaries from "full tosses" and balls in his "half" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>. India managed to score above the par score of 165, reaching 176 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:35:00">[27:35:00]</a>.

### Virat Kohli's Innings: "Shrinkage Kohli"

Virat Kohli's innings was a point of analytical debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>. While he anchored the innings and was India's top scorer, his strike rate of 128 was slower than the game's overall run rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:48:00">[23:48:40]</a>. This raised questions about whether his pace consumed too many balls, potentially impacting India's final score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>. This type of innings, where a player bats well but without significant acceleration, was dubbed "Shrinkage Kohli" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>. Despite the debate, India maintained attacking intent throughout their innings, a notable difference from past [[analysis_of_ind_vs_eng_odi_match_in_cwc2023 | World Cup knockout games against England]] or [[australia_vs_india_world_cup_final_analysis | Australia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:19:00">[21:19:00]</a>.

## South Africa's Chase

India's bowling started strong, with Jasprit Bumrah bowling a "beautiful" delivery to dismiss Reeza Hendricks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>. Arshdeep Singh also picked up a lucky wicket, contributing to early pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>. However, South African batsmen, including Tristan Stubbs and Quinton de Kock, maintained an aggressive approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>.

Axar Patel's "genius" bowling, particularly his slower delivery to dismiss Tristan Stubbs, was highlighted as a crucial moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>. Despite this, India faced a "mass problem" with their bowlers, struggling to get more than eight overs out of their spinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>.

### Turning Points

The match's biggest turning point was identified as Rishabh Pant's knee injury, which led to a break in play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:00">[11:04:00]</a>. Immediately after this, Heinrich Klaasen, who was hitting "video game shots" and dominating the chase, edged a wide ball from Arshdeep Singh and was caught behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a>. This shifted the momentum drastically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:00">[11:50:00]</a>.

Another critical moment was Jasprit Bumrah's over to Marco Jansen, which saw Jansen bowled, further exposing South Africa's lower order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>. Rohit Sharma's decision to bring Bumrah on at this stage was a high-stakes gamble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:00">[13:19:00]</a>.

South Africa's lower batting order, specifically numbers seven, eight, and nine (Jansen, Keshav Maharaj, Kagiso Rabada), was identified as a long-standing weakness that India exploited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:00">[13:42:00]</a>. Maharaj's decision to take a single off the last ball of Bumrah's over was also critiqued, as it took David Miller off strike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:07:00">[35:07:00]</a>.

### Suryakumar Yadav's Catch

Suryakumar Yadav's catch to dismiss David Miller in the final over was a "fantastic" moment that sealed India's victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:16:00">[15:16:00]</a>. The catch was compared to Kapil Dev's catch against Viv Richards in 1983, with the modern catch being praised for its skill despite being debated for a possible boundary line contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:25:00">[14:25:00]</a>. The rules state that if the original contact is made inside the boundary, the fielder can step outside and jump back in to complete the catch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:40:00">[49:40:00]</a>.

## Player Performances

*   **Jasprit Bumrah**: Considered the player of the series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:50:00">[41:50:00]</a>. His bowling, particularly the delivery to Reeza Hendricks, was described as unfair due to its precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>. He consistently looked for wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:53:00">[46:53:00]</a>.
*   **Hardik Pandya**: Played a crucial role, getting the wickets of Heinrich Klaasen and David Miller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:48:00">[37:48:00]</a>. His performance was particularly vital because he had to bowl extra overs when India's spinners were being targeted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:56:00">[37:56:00]</a>. He showed resilience despite not being in his career-best form and facing doubts about his place in the squad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:18:00">[38:18:00]</a>.
*   **Axar Patel**: Took the crucial wicket of Tristan Stubbs with a clever slower ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>. His batting was a "weird knock," starting slowly but contributing 47 off 31 balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:40:00">[22:40:00]</a>.
*   **Heinrich Klaasen**: Was in tears at the end, despite playing an exceptional innings of 52 off 27 balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:25:00">[26:25:00]</a>. He was lauded as "probably the best hitter of spin we have ever seen in T20 cricket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:00">[16:03:00]</a>.
*   **Virat Kohli**: Top-scored with 76 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:23:00">[42:23:00]</a>. His innings was complex, balancing anchoring with the need for acceleration, ultimately contributing to India's competitive total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:48:00">[24:48:00]</a>.

## Overcoming the "Choke" Narrative

India's victory was seen as overcoming their historical "choking" narrative in World Cups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26:00">[15:26:00]</a>. This win, unlike previous tournaments, showed India playing with a "level of intent" that was often missing in [[cricket_analysis_and_player_performance_in_odi_world_cup_2023 | World Cup knockout games]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:41:00">[15:41:00]</a>. They focused on taking wickets and maintaining pressure, even when they were behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:33:00">[15:33:00]</a>.

South Africa, despite being in a winning position multiple times, ultimately succumbed to their historical weakness in critical moments, particularly in the lower order batting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:53:00">[50:53:00]</a>. Their captaincy decisions, such as Aiden Markram bowling himself, were also questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:08:00">[19:08:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

The **T20 World Cup 2024** final was a "magnificent" match, highlighting the "fine margins" in T20 cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:25:00">[26:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:27:00">[29:27:00]</a>. Both teams made tactical mistakes, but India's ability to "problem solve" and their strength in depth, especially with key bowlers and the experienced players, allowed them to prevail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:07">[01:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>. The game was ultimately decided by clutch moments and the ability of India's key players, particularly Jasprit Bumrah and Hardik Pandya, to deliver under immense pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. The final is considered to be among the top three or four World Cup finals of all time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:57">[01:20:57]</a>.

The relevance and future of One Day International (ODI) cricket have become a significant topic of debate, particularly concerning the ODI World Cup format. The discussion has intensified, with some suggesting that the 2023 tournament could potentially be the last 50-over World Cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:05">[00:58:05]</a>.

## Perceptions and Performance
A narrative has emerged that links England's performance in tournaments to the format's perceived health. When England performs well, the narrative suggests they are "reinventing" both Test and ODI cricket. However, when they perform poorly, the discourse often shifts to "ODI Cricket is dying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:40">[00:57:40]</a>. This phenomenon has been observed and tweeted about by various cricket analysts, including those from India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:01">[00:58:01]</a>.

## Internal Discussions and Broadcaster Influence
Discussions about the potential end of the 50-over World Cup have occurred at the highest levels of cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:48">[00:58:48]</a>. This conversation is not solely driven by media or public perception, but rather by internal discussions and decisions within cricket's governing bodies.

The primary force behind this shift comes from broadcasters, who are "the people who pay the bills" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:16">[00:59:16]</a>. Broadcasters reportedly believe that in the upcoming cycle, the Twenty20 (T20) World Cup should become the most important format, potentially at the expense of the 50-over World Cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>. Some cricket boards, including England, have questioned the viability of ODI cricket, with lower-end boards stating they no longer make money from these matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:22">[00:59:22]</a>.

## Financial and Engagement Paradox
Paradoxically, the 2023 50-over World Cup is projected to generate more revenue than any previous World Cup, including T20 World Cups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:46">[00:59:46]</a>. Despite this, the format as a whole outside of the World Cup struggles with engagement. International cricket analysts rarely follow bilateral ODI series unless they are in the lead-up to a major tournament, citing the significant extra work for little return, the perceived lack of seriousness in games, and frequent player resting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:24">[01:00:24]</a>.

## [[ODI World Cup format and its implications | Format Critique]]
The current [[ODI World Cup format and its implications | ODI World Cup format]], a long round-robin style, has also drawn criticism. Despite the potential for closer matches, the tournament has seen few, leading to concerns that it "just dragging on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:28">[01:00:28]</a>. The ICC is seen as having "no one to blame but themselves" if discussions about the death of ODI cricket persist during the latter stages of the tournament, especially if the top four teams are solidified early with many games remaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a>. While the ODI format was invented to provide more close finishes than Test cricket, the current tournament has been unlucky in this regard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:35">[01:01:35]</a>. Better tournament structures, such as a double round-robin with key matchups like India playing Pakistan twice, are suggested as alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:01">[01:02:01]</a>.

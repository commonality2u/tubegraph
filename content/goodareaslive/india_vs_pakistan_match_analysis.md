The recent [[india_vs_pakistan_champions_trophy_match_analysis | India vs Pakistan]] cricket match was described as "absolutely crazy coconuts bananas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Unlike many previous encounters that weren't particularly interesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, this game was "fantastic" largely due to the "trash nature of the pitch," which was deemed so bad it "should be burned" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## India's Innings (Batting First)

[[comparative_analysis_of_india_and_pakistan_cricket_teams | India]] began their innings as if the wicket wasn't much of an issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Rohit Sharma hit the ball in the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Rishabh Pant survived numerous close calls, arguably being dismissed "83 times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, while Axar Patel was scoring "really well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. They managed to score 50 runs early on, a feat that seemed unlikely for any team on this pitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This aggressive start, yielding 26 runs in two overs, was crucial for [[comparative_analysis_of_india_and_pakistan_cricket_teams | India]] to win the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Rishabh Pant's 42 off 31 balls, despite some luck, was highlighted as perhaps the most important innings, allowing [[comparative_analysis_of_india_and_pakistan_cricket_teams | India]] to have more batters later on and avoid early wicket losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. Axar Patel also made 20 runs and took a wicket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.

### Pakistan's Bowling in the First Innings

[[comparative_analysis_of_india_and_pakistan_cricket_teams | Pakistan]] was initially in "complete disarray" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Haris Rauf bowled one of the "worst overs" before the drinks break, conceding three fours in a row <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. There were fielding errors, including a missed run-out chance for Axar Patel and Usman Khan attempting catches clearly meant for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

Despite the initial shambles, [[comparative_analysis_of_india_and_pakistan_cricket_teams | Pakistan]] remained in the game due to numerous edges and balls flying in the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Haris Rauf's fortunes dramatically shifted after the drinks break. Following a wild LBW appeal for a ball miles down leg side, he suddenly found his rhythm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. This changed the game, with all [[comparative_analysis_of_india_and_pakistan_cricket_teams | Pakistan]]i seamers performing well as the wicket changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. [[comparative_analysis_of_india_and_pakistan_cricket_teams | India]] collapsed from 89 for 3 to 119 all out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. The pitch started playing worse, causing balls to hit the stickers and bounce unusually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

Despite being sent up the order, Arshdeep Singh surprisingly made runs and outscored Hardik Pandya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. [[comparative_analysis_of_india_and_pakistan_cricket_teams | India]] finished on 119 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, with 59 dot balls, 26 singles, 13 fours, and two sixes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.

Nazim Shah was described as "absolutely incredible," although it took [[comparative_analysis_of_india_and_pakistan_cricket_teams | Pakistan]]'s bowlers some time to work out their best delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. Mohammad Amir was noted for bowling a bit wide early on, and Shaheen Shah Afridi was "a little bit disappointing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. Nazim Shah's performance was compared to Pat Cummins, suggesting he's a slightly better white-ball bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.

## Pakistan's Innings (Chasing 119)

Many thought [[comparative_analysis_of_india_and_pakistan_cricket_teams | Pakistan]] were favorites to chase 119, but it was noted how difficult it is to chase that total on this particular pitch, especially with Jasprit Bumrah in the opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. [[comparative_analysis_of_india_and_pakistan_cricket_teams | Pakistan]] started strongly in their chase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Babar Azam had an incredibly high strike rate of 300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, and the innings began with two threes, a rare occurrence in a [[cricket_analysis_and_commentary_on_the_match | T20 game]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Two catches were dropped: one by Shivam Dube at fine leg, and a harder one by Mohammed Siraj <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

Despite flying high, [[comparative_analysis_of_india_and_pakistan_cricket_teams | Pakistan]]'s chase faltered after Babar Azam's wicket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. They then focused on preserving wickets, which wasn't the right approach for the pitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. At the drinks break, they were 57 for 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>, needing a run a ball. Axar Patel's first over, where he bowled one through to get an LBW, marked a "complete reversal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

### India's Bowling in the Second Innings

Hardik Pandya transitioned from looking like a liability to bowling "really well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, benefiting from the wicket changing again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Arshdeep Singh also bowled well. [[comparative_analysis_of_india_and_pakistan_cricket_teams | India]] gained momentum, and [[comparative_analysis_of_india_and_pakistan_cricket_teams | Pakistan]] couldn't apply pressure due to players like Iftikhar Ahmed batting with a strike rate under 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

Jasprit Bumrah's third over was a critical moment. Mohammad Rizwan attempted an ill-advised slug sweep, leading to his dismissal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. This shot was criticized as a "terrible, terrible choice" given Bumrah bowled it "fast and straight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. From that point, [[comparative_analysis_of_india_and_pakistan_cricket_teams | Pakistan]]'s chances of winning significantly diminished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. They reached a point needing about 30 runs off 18 balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>, which would be manageable on a different pitch but was incredibly difficult on this one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

Mohammad Rizwan's innings of 31 from 44 balls, while likely to receive criticism, was defended as "absolutely fine" for that pitch, although his dismissal off Bumrah was not the right risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. Nazim Shah was emotional at the end, having come within a meter of giving [[comparative_analysis_of_india_and_pakistan_cricket_teams | Pakistan]] a last-ball chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

Arshdeep Singh "struggled" but it was not the worst case for [[comparative_analysis_of_india_and_pakistan_cricket_teams | India]] as he might not play in the Caribbean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. Axar Patel bowled "really, really well" and secured a breakthrough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. Mohammed Siraj was "fantastic," adapting to the wicket by ripping the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. Hardik Pandya finished with 2 for 24 from four overs, improving significantly after an expensive start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Jasprit Bumrah was lauded as "magnificent" and "unplayable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>, with his ability to hit the stumps regularly highlighted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>. His "true values" in [[cricket_analysis_and_commentary_on_the_match | T20 International]]s show him as an excellent middle and death overs bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

## Conclusion

[[comparative_analysis_of_india_and_pakistan_cricket_teams | Pakistan]] "kudr K na armed themselves," managing to lose to the [[usa_vs_pakistan_cricket_match_analysis | USA]] and then to [[comparative_analysis_of_india_and_pakistan_cricket_teams | India]] chasing 119 in a manner that the only logical outcome is for [[comparative_analysis_of_india_and_pakistan_cricket_teams | Pakistan]] to win the tournament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. The overall pitch condition was described as "dreadful" and "unsafe," with many batters getting hit in the hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a>. The game demonstrated [[comparative_analysis_of_india_and_pakistan_cricket_teams | India]]'s success by attacking on a difficult pitch, rather than adopting a conservative approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:23">[00:33:23]</a>.

## The Chasing Obsession

Since 2013, cricket teams have predominantly chosen to bowl first after winning the toss in T20 matches, a trend that has become deeply ingrained in team philosophy over the past 11 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This contrasts with traditional Test cricket, where batting first is often the preferred choice unless conditions heavily favor bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. The prevailing belief is that knowing the target allows batters to play more strategically, reducing risks associated with setting a total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

## Statistical Overview

While the advantage for teams chasing in T20s has been clear from 2015 onwards, it is often a minor one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

*   Teams that bowl first win approximately 53% of the time, compared to 47% for teams that bat first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. This represents a 6% advantage for chasing teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   Despite popular perception, where some fans believe the toss determines 70% of the outcome, the actual win percentage is much lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   In 2022, teams batting first actually won more games, yet this had no impact on the decision-making at the toss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   Around 2017, the philosophy of fielding first became widespread, with roughly 75% of teams opting to bowl first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
*   From 2023 onwards, international teams still bat first about one-third of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   Franchise teams, however, show an even stronger preference, opting to field first almost all the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. In the Caribbean Premier League (CPL), teams choose to field first 85% of the time, despite teams batting first winning 50% of their games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

## Factors Influencing the Decision

### Dew Factor

The "dew factor" is often cited as a reason to chase, making bowling with a wet ball difficult in the second innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. However, the data suggests that dew may not be as significant a factor as commonly believed, given the relatively small advantage for chasing teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. Dew does not always come in during the second innings, and its timing can vary by ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

### Setting a Total

Teams can find setting a total challenging as they are unsure what constitutes a good score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Conversely, knowing the target allows batters to pace their innings more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

### Pitch Conditions

*   T20 surfaces generally tend to be truer, designed for high runs, though anomalies exist, such as in the West Indies or Bangladesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.
*   Some grounds consistently favor batting first, while others are known for significant dew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.
*   Teams should consider individual ground conditions, curator insights, and weather forecasts (e.g., rain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

### Player Fatigue/Weather

In hot and humid conditions (e.g., Australia, Pakistan, India), the fielding team can become drained before their batting innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. This factor is not consistently considered in team planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.

## Team-Specific Strategies and Their Consequences

### England's Automatic Approach

From 2016 onwards, England has opted to bat first only 6-7% of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. Notably, from early 2017 to late 2021, England did not choose to bat first once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. Despite winning over 50% of games when they *have* batted first in this period, their preference remains to bowl first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. This unwavering approach, often influenced by analysts, has led to a "feedback loop" where their success in chasing reinforces their belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. In the T20 World Cup semi-final against [[batting_performance_analysis_of_india_and_australia | India]] in Guyana, England chose to bowl first on a pitch expected to slow down, and they subsequently lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

### Pakistan's Missed Opportunity

Pakistan's T20 international team is often seen as stronger when chasing rather than setting totals, a known deficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Despite this, they consistently choose to field first in bilateral T20s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. This strategy hinders their preparation for T20 World Cups, where they may be forced to bat first and struggle, as seen in their loss to the USA batting first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. Bilateral series, which hold less significance, could be used to practice batting first and improve this weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

### Afghanistan and India: Adapting to Conditions

*   Afghanistan, whose squad composition favors setting totals, has opted to bat first more than 30% of the time since 2016, a comparatively higher rate among international sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. However, even this is not their ideal proportion given their team's strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. In the T20 World Cup semi-final, they chose to bat first in Trinidad on a challenging pitch and were bowled out for 56 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>.
*   [[batting_performance_analysis_of_india_and_australia | India]], like England, often opts to bowl first automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>. However, in the Guyana semi-final, [[batting_performance_analysis_of_india_and_australia | India]] made a "cricket decision," with Rohit Sharma indicating he would have batted first had he won the toss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>. They also batted first in the final and won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>. This suggests a willingness to adapt based on conditions, unlike some other teams.

## Is the Strategy "Unthinking"?

Many teams appear to make the toss decision automatically rather than from a position of making the best decision for the specific game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. This "mindlessness" can lead to predictable strategies that can be exploited by opponents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. While the 6% statistical advantage for chasing exists, it may not justify a blanket approach, especially when considering individual pitch conditions, team strengths, and tournament importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Experts argue that teams should gather as much data as possible, including local conditions and weather, to inform their decisions rather than relying on a default strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>. This goes beyond basic [[analyzing_cricket_data | data analysis]] and requires a deeper understanding of contextual factors, similar to the nuances involved in evaluating specific matchups between bowlers and batters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>.

## Future Considerations and Proposed Changes

The increasing scores in T20 cricket (e.g., 260-280 in IPL) might lead to a change in chasing dynamics, as the pressure of such high targets could become immense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>. If a consistent percentage advantage for the bowling team persists, cricket authorities might need to intervene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>. One suggested change, previously trialed in English First-Class Cricket, is for the away team to decide whether to bat or bowl first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a>. This would make pitch preparation more uncertain and potentially fairer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>. The prevailing concern about dew might also be overstated, raising questions about the necessity of measures like "super soppers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>.

For international teams, particularly, bilateral T20s should serve as preparation for major tournaments like the T20 World Cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. This means consciously developing skills in both batting first and second, rather than merely accumulating wins in less significant matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>.

Pakistan's cricket history, particularly its bowling heritage, has been marked by periods of immense success, innovation, and recent decline [01:49:10]. The nation has consistently produced world-class bowlers, earning a reputation for its unique flair and scientific approach to the game [04:17:00].

## The Fazal Mahmood Era (1952-1962)

Pakistan began its Test cricket journey with a prominent bowler in Fazal Mahmood [02:01:00]. Mahmood is considered the "Pioneer" and "first hero of fast bowling" for Pakistan [05:29:00]. In Pakistan's second-ever Test match, he took 12 wickets against India in Lucknow, leading to a victory [05:41:00]. Over his 34 Test matches from 1952 to 1962, Mahmood secured 139 wickets in 53 innings at an average of around 25 [05:48:00]. Notably, 65 of these wickets came in seven Test wins at an average of 10.69 [06:01:00]. His rate of 2.62 wickets per innings in Test cricket is a number "bested only by seven other bowlers in history" [06:08:00]. He was known for his "sex appeal" and being "the definition of cool," even modeling for Brylcreem and often seen with a cigarette in hand [05:35:00].

Despite Mahmood's heroics, Pakistan's overall bowling performance in this decade was middling [08:08:00]. Only India and New Zealand had a worse seam bowling average than Pakistan, and their spinners were only better than New Zealand, averaging 44.34 runs per dismissal [08:11:00].

## The Barren Years (1962-1976)

Following Fazal Mahmood's last Test in August 1962, Pakistan's fast bowling average rose by four runs to 33 over the next 14 years [09:42:00]. Interestingly, their spin bowling average was the second best in this period, potentially influenced by Inab Alam [09:52:00]. However, their overall bowling average was only better than India and New Zealand [09:58:00]. This era saw Pakistan win only three out of 34 Test matches, all against New Zealand [10:05:00]. This period is described as the "barren years," where the team "really struggled to be consistently good" [10:18:00].

> Unlike the current era where Pakistan is losing more, this team frequently drew matches, which "make some of those old teams look slightly better than they were" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a>.

## The Golden Era (1976-1999)

Starting from October 1976, Pakistan's cricket saw a significant transformation, continuing until the end of the millennium [13:06:00]. This period is recognized as Pakistan's "Golden Era" [13:16:00].

### Innovation and Key Bowlers

Sarfaraz Nawaz, known for his 9-wicket haul in Melbourne, made reverse swing mainstream for Pakistan and taught it to Imran Khan [13:19:00]. Imran Khan, who later became the "man who personified Pakistan cricket," then transferred this knowledge to Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis [13:27:00]. The "two W's" became Pakistan's most prolific bowlers in Test cricket, famously destroying stumps with their reverse-swinging, toe-crushing yorkers [13:38:00].

This era also saw a rise in quality spin bowling. Abdul Qadir was the "best tweaker of his generation" and "kept leg spin alive" [15:58:00]. Saqlain Mushtaq pioneered the *dusra*, and Mushtaq Ahmed was also a prominent spinner [16:03:00]. Pakistan was the "best spin bowling team for 23 odd years" [16:08:00], with a combined average of 32 runs per wicket for their spinners [15:47:00].

### Dominance and Reputation

In this 23-year period, Pakistan's pacers were only behind West Indies and South Africa in terms of average [13:53:00]. This dominance was achieved largely on "mostly flat decks at home" [14:06:00]. Their overall bowling average was also third best in the world from October 1976 to the end of 1999 [18:21:00]. This period defined [[evolution_of_india_and_pakistans_cricket_teams_over_the_years | Pakistan cricket]], with their presence on TV and a World Cup win further solidifying their status [15:02:00].

> [!info] The Mad Scientists of Bowling
> Pakistan's bowlers in this era were described as the "Mad scientists of cricket bowling," constantly inventing new techniques like the *dusra* and reverse swing to stay ahead [04:55:00].

## The Pre-Exile Era (2000-2009)

The early 2000s saw the retirement of Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis, and Saqlain Mushtaq's decline [19:00:00]. While bowlers like Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammad Asif "managed to keep the spice of Pakistan's bowling alive," they were frequently injured or banned [19:14:00]. Pakistan's bowling average in this period was only better than West Indies, Zimbabwe, and Bangladesh [19:22:00]. Danish Kaneria was also a prominent spinner in this era, taking 260 Test wickets, though he often went for many runs [19:36:00]. Despite some individual brilliance, the bowling attack was "very thin" [20:43:00].

## The UAE Era (2009-2019)

After the Sri Lankan team attack in Lahore in March 2009, Pakistan played "almost all of their home Cricket in the UAE" until late 2019 [21:37:00]. This period surprisingly saw "another good run" for Pakistan [21:46:00]. Misbah-ul-Haq's leadership helped stabilize the team after controversies, leading Pakistan to become the number one Test team in the world for a brief period [23:02:00].

This success was heavily reliant on spin bowling [23:37:00]. Saeed Ajmal and Yasir Shah were instrumental, with their careers, though not overlapping, being "demonic in nature" [23:56:00]. Saeed Ajmal was known for turning the ball in "every direction," disproving science [24:50:00]. Abdur Rehman, a "fast spinner" with a Test bowling average of 29, was a "brilliant second spinner" and foil to Ajmal [24:27:00]. Pakistan's Spinners were the second-best in the world in these 10 years, behind only India [25:58:00]. While fast bowlers did not have great returns, Pakistan still maintained the fifth-best overall bowling average globally, making 20 wickets in a Test match "not an issue" [26:06:00]. The UAE wickets were spinning wickets, favoring Pakistan's spinners [26:58:00].

## Return Home and Recent Struggles (2019-Present)

Test cricket returned to Pakistan in December 2019, with initial home series wins against Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and South Africa [27:41:00]. Bowling sides out was not an issue in this "small little period" [28:01:00]. However, the situation dramatically worsened from the start of the Australian Series in March 2022, marking a significant winless streak [29:19:00].

### The Winless Streak (March 2022 onwards)

In 10 home Test matches since March 2022, Pakistan has taken only 128 wickets and managed to take 20 wickets in a Test on "one occasion" [29:54:00]. This period includes two drawn games against Australia, a 3-0 sweep by England (Pakistan's first-ever home Test series sweep), a 0-0 draw against New Zealand, and a 2-0 sweep by Bangladesh [29:25:00].

> [!warning] Home Ground Disadvantage
> In these 10 home Tests, local bowlers have averaged 47 with the ball, compared to opposition bowlers who averaged 36, an 11-run difference per wicket [32:44:00]. This indicates that the problem is not just the flat pitches, as opposition bowlers are still taking wickets [33:21:00]. Opposition seamers averaged 31, while Pakistan's averaged 47 [33:37:00].

### Shaheen Afridi's Decline

Shaheen Afridi's performance has significantly dropped since his knee injury in July 2022 [40:06:00]. Before the injury, he had 99 wickets in 25 Tests at less than 25 runs apiece [40:12:00]. Since then, in five Tests, he has averaged 41 with the ball [40:21:00]. Shaheen, once known as a "new ball destroyer" who averaged under 20 in the first 10 overs, now bowls at significantly reduced speeds and lacks lateral movement [41:42:00]. His injury management is considered a major factor in his decline [43:05:00]. However, Shaheen has only played four of these 10 winless home Tests, suggesting he is "not the root cause of Pakistan's bowling woes" [43:21:00].

### Fast Bowling Issues

Pakistan has struggled with a lack of experienced fast bowlers and continuity in selection [45:55:00]. Besides Shaheen and Naseem Shah (who is often injured [44:35:00]), six other pacers have been tried in this winless streak, with Muhammad Ali averaging 67.66 with the ball [46:31:00]. There's a "sheer lack of pace" [48:28:00], with Haris Rauf being the only express pacer, who broke down quickly [48:38:00]. The [[pakistans_cricket_strategy_and_performance_issues | PCB]] is criticized for poor injury management and mixing formats, often playing key bowlers in T20s while resting them for Tests [48:18:00].

### Spin Bowling Issues

Abrar Ahmed, Pakistan's current frontline spinner, had a phenomenal start with 11 wickets on debut against England but has since dropped off [50:00:00]. He has 29 wickets in five home Tests at an average over 36 and has faced injuries and lack of match practice [50:10:00]. Other spinners like Yasir Shah (who "fell off a cliff" after returning home [50:48:00]), Zahid Mahmood, Sajid Khan, and Nauman Ali have all averaged over 36 [50:53:00]. Five overseas spinners have performed better than Pakistan's tweakers in this period [51:15:00]. Pakistan lacks a "primary spinner" [51:52:00], and promising talents like Zafar Gohar have been discarded [51:54:00].

## Systemic Issues

The recent decline is attributed to a lack of proper "structure" and "professionalism" within [[structure_and_governance_of_pakistan_cricket | Pakistan cricket]] [53:50:00]. The focus on finding a "savior or hero" rather than establishing systems leads to inconsistent selection and poor long-term planning [45:52:00]. The PCB is criticized for "poor injury management" and for not prioritizing Test cricket [48:18:00]. Players not being paid on time is another recurring issue, impacting player morale and retention [52:14:00].

> [!warning] Lack of Professionalism
> "Pakistan cricket is not professional in any way, shape or form and it's very hard to go up against other players when you're when you've got that lack of professionalism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:25:00">[53:25:00]</a>.
> "The problem with Pakistan cricket isn't that... Abrar isn't good enough... the problems with Pakistan cricket is they are amateurs playing in a world of professionalism and it's coming undone over and over again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:07:00">[58:07:00]</a>.

Historically, Pakistan's innovation in bowling stemmed from the need to find ways to take wickets on flat pitches [38:29:00]. However, modern bowlers lack the ability to get wickets on flat pitches, while opposition teams succeed on the same surfaces [38:37:00]. The current situation reflects that Pakistan's "Supreme bowling Legacy is basically a thing of the past now" [56:26:00].

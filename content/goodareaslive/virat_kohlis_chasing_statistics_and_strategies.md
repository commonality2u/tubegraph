[[virat_kohli_and_his_performance_in_odi_cricket | Virat Kohli]] is widely recognized for his prowess in chasing totals in limited-overs [[cricket_strategies_and_game_analysis | cricket]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:18">[08:18:18]</a>. A significant aspect of his [[virat_kohlis_batting_strategy_and_records | batting strategy]] is his reliance on a "formula" during innings, preferring to know "exactly what they need to do at all times" rather than having an open canvas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>. This structured approach means that any risky decisions he makes are calculated based on the innings' requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:34">[08:58:34]</a>.

## Overall Chasing Performance

Statistical analysis of [[virat_kohli_and_his_performance_in_odi_cricket | Virat Kohli's]] performance reveals a stark difference between his first and second innings batting averages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:48">[09:10:48]</a>. While his strike rate remains largely similar, his batting average "goes absolutely through the roof" in the second innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:33">[09:16:33]</a>.

### Impact of Match Outcome

[[understanding_cricket_statistics | Statistics]] further differentiate his performance based on whether India wins or loses the match:
*   When India wins and bats first, [[virat_kohli_and_his_performance_in_odi_cricket | Kohli]] averages just over 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:37">[09:37:37]</a>.
*   When India loses and bats first, his average drops to around 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:31">[09:44:31]</a>.
*   However, when India wins while batting second, his average takes a "massive jump up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>, reaching "super NOA" levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:43">[10:05:43]</a>.
*   Interestingly, when India loses while batting second, there is no significant difference in his average compared to losing while batting first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:14">[10:14:14]</a>.

### Influence of the Toss

The toss also plays a role in his performance:
*   When India loses the toss and fields, his strike rate sees a slight dip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:48">[10:35:48]</a>.
*   [[virat_kohli_and_his_performance_in_odi_cricket | Kohli]] generally dislikes batting first after winning the toss, possibly due to uncertainty about the required run rate, which relates back to his preference for a clear "formula" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:24">[10:43:24]</a>.
*   When India wins the toss and chooses to bat first, his average is just under 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:00">[10:55:00]</a>.
*   His average significantly increases when India wins the toss and fields first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:23">[11:00:23]</a>.

Perhaps the most fascinating [[understanding_cricket_statistics | statistic]] is when the opposing team wins the toss and decides to bat first, effectively forcing [[virat_kohli_and_his_performance_in_odi_cricket | Kohli]] to bat second. In this scenario, his average remains impressively high, around 60, showing a remarkable ability to perform even when conditions or tactical decisions are not his team's preferred choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:16">[11:16:16]</a>.

## Impact of Match Conditions: Day vs. Day-Night

A key factor influencing [[virat_kohli_and_his_performance_in_odi_cricket | Kohli's]] chasing performance appears to be the match timing:
*   In day matches where he bats second, his average is around his career norm of 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:06">[13:08:06]</a>.
*   However, in day-night matches when batting second, there is a "big big difference and a big jump up" in his average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:14:10">[13:14:10]</a>.
*   This suggests that he particularly thrives when the ball comes onto the bat better, which often occurs at night due to moisture in the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:28:16">[13:28:16]</a>. This preference aligns with his success in places like Australia, where pitches offer more pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:24">[13:51:24]</a>.
*   In chases at night, his strike rate also significantly increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:16:04">[14:16:04]</a>, further supporting the idea that he prefers how the ball behaves under lights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:23:00">[14:23:00]</a>.

While the "formula" and understanding his job are crucial elements of his chasing prowess, the physical properties of the ball — specifically how it comes onto the bat at night — are also significant factors in [[virat_kohli_and_his_performance_in_odi_cricket | Virat Kohli's]] success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:28:00">[14:28:00]</a>.

## [[impact_of_virat_kohlis_leadership_style | Captaincy]] and Wicket Priority

Players, especially captains, sometimes prioritize their wicket more in high-pressure chase situations compared to batting first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>. This focus on preserving the wicket can be observed in their approach during chases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:00]</a>.

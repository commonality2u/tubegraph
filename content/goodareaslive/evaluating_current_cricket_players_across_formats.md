The 19th episode of the Crick Picks podcast focused on drafting the top five currently active all-format cricket players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. A key criterion for selection was that players must be active in all three formats of the game (Test, One-Day International (ODI), and Twenty20 International (T20I)) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The discussion highlighted various [[methods_of_evaluating_cricket_players | criteria for ranking players]], including current form, historical performance, skill, impact, and versatility across different [[cricketing_roles_and_player_performance_assessment | cricketing roles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

## Top Picks for All-Format Players

### Jasprit Bumrah
Jasprit Bumrah was an almost unanimous first pick, considered the best all-format bowler and possibly the best all-format cricketer currently playing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. He is lauded as the most skillful pacer of his generation, known for his pinpoint execution, a wide array of tricks, and his ability to take wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. His success has defied the traditional notion that limited-overs bowlers cannot succeed in Test cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Despite missing some games, his impact when available is unmatched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

### Kagiso Rabada
Kagiso Rabada was selected for his consistent threat in taking wickets across all formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. While there are some questions regarding his T20 performances where he can be expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>, his overall ability to secure wickets makes him a strong choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

### Rohit Sharma
Rohit Sharma's recent phenomenal form, especially his aggressive batting style change in the ODI World Cup, made him a top pick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. He transformed from a run accumulator to an attacking opener, significantly aiding India's batting success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. His performance as a Test opener, particularly overseas, has also been a revelation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

### Mitchell Marsh
Mitchell Marsh was considered a "hipster pick" for his role perfection across all three formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. He offers flexibility in the lower-middle order in Tests, contributing crucial counter-attacking innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. As a T20 captain and essential player, and a hit-or-miss but impactful performer in ODIs, he provides valuable utility to Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

### Virat Kohli
Virat Kohli, despite not being in his absolute peak form, still demonstrates exceptional performance across formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. His statistics from the last two years include a Test average of 42 (with two centuries), an ODI average of 64 at a run-a-ball, and a T20I average of 53 with a strike rate of 140 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. His [[assessing_the_performance_and_style_of_specific_cricket_players | ODI World Cup performance]] and consistent IPL numbers underscore his continued relevance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

### Kuldeep Yadav
Kuldeep Yadav is highlighted for his impressive performances, especially against England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. He is recognized as perhaps the most talented spinner globally and has become an indispensable part of India's Test team when playing at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. His development through career low points has made him a consistent wicket-taking option in limited-overs [[cricket_and_player_performances | cricket]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>.

### Daryl Mitchell
Daryl Mitchell's incredible rise makes him a strong contender. He is currently one of the best Test batters in the world, playing impactful innings in ODIs, and having memorable performances in T20 World Cups, all without consistently bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. His peak form and understanding of his game contribute to his selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>.

### Shubman Gill
Shubman Gill is identified as a young player with a promising future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>. He boasts a remarkable ODI average of 61 across 44 games and has shown exceptional batting in the IPL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>. Gill has recently silenced critics regarding his Test career with strong performances, cementing his place as a likely mainstay for India in all three formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.

### Naseem Shah
Naseem Shah is considered a "projection pick" due to his immense talent and potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>. He is viewed as Pakistan's best seamer with a higher ceiling than Shaheen Shah Afridi, capable of bowling in all phases of limited-overs cricket and excelling in Tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>. His handy batting also adds to his value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>.

### Mohammed Shami
Mohammed Shami's evolution as a T20 bowler, particularly in the last few years, complements his established prowess in ODIs and Tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. While not always a death bowler, his ability to take early wickets and be a consistent threat elevates his all-format credentials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>.

### Josh Hazlewood
Josh Hazlewood has defied being pigeonholed as just a Test bowler, performing surprisingly well and consistently for Australia in limited-overs [[cricket_and_player_performances | cricket]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. His Test record includes 58 wickets at an average of 21 in 13 matches over the last two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:47">[00:33:47]</a>. He maintains good economy in ODIs and, despite a slight dip, has strong T20 numbers from various leagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a>.

### Ravindra Jadeja
Ravindra Jadeja is a solid all-rounder, whose bowling prowess often compensates for fluctuations in his batting form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>. His impactful bowling, even on flat tracks, and ability to sustain performance across all three formats make him a valuable utility player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>. His batting at the death in T20s and exceptional fielding further enhance his value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>.

### Matt Henry
Matt Henry is an underappreciated player who has significantly improved his Test numbers, averaging 25 in the last couple of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>. He has a splendid ODI record (27 average, 5 economy) and strong T20 figures (23 average, 7.8 economy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:13">[00:39:13]</a>. Known for his new ball skills, accuracy, and energy, he is considered New Zealand's best all-format bowler after Trent Boult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>.

### Mohammad Rizwan
Mohammad Rizwan is a strong all-format player, particularly for his wicketkeeping and batting contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. While his T20 strike rate has been a point of contention, he provides consistent runs as an anchor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:38">[00:43:38]</a>. In ODIs, he is a reliable middle-order choice, averaging 40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a>. He has a phenomenal Test record for a wicketkeeper-batter, averaging over 40, especially impressive due to his success away from home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:20">[00:43:20]</a>.

## Other Notable Mentions and Considerations
The discussion also touched upon other [[active_allformat_cricket_players | active all-format players]] and those who might have qualified under different criteria:

*   **Trent Boult**: His qualification was questioned due to not playing regularly, despite being available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   **Tamim Iqbal**: Mentioned as someone who might still qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

*   **Quinton de Kock**: Does not play all formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:08">[00:47:08]</a>.

*   **Curtis Campher**: An example of a player who "plays above his talent level" in all three formats due to his batting, bowling, and fielding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>.
*   **Rashid Khan**: Also discussed but recently injured and has not played Test cricket since 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:17">[00:52:17]</a>.

The first match of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy saw [[indias_dominance_in_ausvind_test_series | India]] achieve a thumping victory against Australia in Perth, walloping the Aussies by 295 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:"></a>. This monumental win marked [[indias_dominance_in_ausvind_test_series | India]]'s biggest ever Test victory in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:"></a>, and their third-biggest ever Test win globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:"></a>. Australia, previously unbeaten in five games at the OPA Stadium in Perth, faced a significant upset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:"></a>. Despite being bowled out for 150 in their first innings, which was the only period Australia was ahead in the Test match, [[indias_dominance_in_ausvind_test_series | India]] staged a massive comeback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:"></a>.

> [!info] Initial Odds
> At the start of the Test match, [[indias_dominance_in_ausvind_test_series | India]]'s odds were about 3 or 4 to 1, which later plummeted to 11 to 1 after their first innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:"></a>. Their ability to storm back from this position to win by 295 runs was magnificent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:"></a>.

## Understrength Yet Dominant
A remarkable aspect of [[indias_dominance_in_ausvind_test_series | India]]'s victory was that they were significantly understrength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:"></a>. They played without their captain and opener Rohit Sharma, Shubman Gill (due to a fractured thumb), Hardik Pandya, and Mohammed Shami <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:"></a>. Furthermore, they intentionally chose not to include Ravichandran Ashwin or Ravindra Jadeja <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:"></a>. This win is considered one of [[important_test_series_victories_in_cricket_history | India]]'s greatest ever away victories in Test cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:"></a>.

## Pitch Evolution and Conditions
The pitch at Perth underwent a drastic evolution throughout the match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:"></a>. On Day 1, 17 wickets fell, while on Day 2, only three wickets fell, with [[indias_dominance_in_ausvind_test_series | India]] not losing a single wicket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:"></a>. By Day 3, variable bounce began to emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:"></a>. Despite these changing conditions, [[indias_dominance_in_ausvind_test_series | India]] proved superior in all aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:"></a>.

## Jasprit Bumrah's Masterclass
[[indias_bowling_performance_in_the_test | Jasprit Bumrah]] led from the front, earning the Player of the Match award <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:"></a>. His career is "littered with brilliance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:"></a>. He took eight wickets in the match, including 5 for 30 in the first innings and 3 for 42 in the second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:"></a>. His Test bowling average now stands at 20.06 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:"></a>.

> "Conditions don't matter, opposition doesn't matter, format doesn't matter. Just Bumrah is the undisputed king of all-format cricket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:"></a>.

Bumrah's performance with the new ball reached "another level" in this match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:"></a>, with his first new ball spell being "exhilarating" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:"></a>. Crucially, he displayed exceptional intelligence by analyzing Australia's bowling in the first innings and adjusting his length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:"></a>. While Australia bowled a good length, Bumrah picked a "far more dangerous length" that kept the stumps in play, making him "absolutely unplayable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:"></a>. His mastery of each facet of the game continues to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:"></a>.

## Other Indian Bowlers' Contributions
*   **Harshit Rana (Debut)**: The debutant secured four wickets in the Test, including 3 for 48 in his first bowling innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:41:"></a>. Despite not being express pace, his lengths were precise, especially for a debutant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:51:"></a>. He created many chances in the first innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:46:"></a> and hit the surface hard, extracting movement from the wicket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:49:"></a>.
*   **Mohammed Siraj**: After a lean run of form, Siraj delivered five wickets in the match (2/20 and 3/51), including vital top-order dismissals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:50:"></a>. His overseas record in Test cricket holds up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:00:"></a>, and he looked in rhythm, finding the correct length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:06:"></a>. The pressure taken off by Bumrah's initial wickets likely helped Siraj and Rana bowl with less strain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:42:"></a>.

## Indian Batting Highlights
*   **Yashasvi Jaiswal**: After scoring a duck in the first innings, Jaiswal slammed 161 runs in the third innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:41:"></a>. Known for converting hundreds into "daddy hundreds," his four Test tons include 171 vs West Indies, 209 vs England, and an unbeaten 214 vs England at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:54:"></a>. His ability to move past the "landmark thing" (getting out soon after reaching a century) is exceptional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:43:"></a>, with his next lowest hundred being 144 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:50:"></a>. He is seen as the "most shining star when it comes to batting talents of the next generation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:29:"></a>, possibly becoming the best batter in the world in the next 1-5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:04:"></a>. He thrives as an opener in an era where good openers are scarce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:01:"></a>.
*   **KL Rahul**: Despite detractors, Rahul scored 26 runs in the first innings (amidst a controversial dismissal) and 77 in the second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:45:"></a>. He formed a strong partnership with Jaiswal, looking "assured in his stroke play" and "very comfortable" at the crease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:04:"></a>. His versatility, batting from 1 to 6, has kept him in the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:18:"></a>, and he has the best overseas average among [[Indias_performance_in_ICC_events | Indian]] batters since 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:27:"></a>.
*   **Virat Kohli**: After scoring 5 in the first innings and a dropped catch, Kohli bounced back with an unbeaten 100 in the third innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:22:"></a>. This was his 30th Test hundred, with nine coming against Australia and seven of those in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:31:"></a>. He now has 81 centuries in total in international cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:40:"></a>. Kohli adapted his game, sweeping and reverse-sweeping, which he doesn't typically do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:46:"></a>. His method and balance looked "absolutely sensational" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:09:"></a>, showing a willingness to sacrifice for the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:34:"></a>.
*   **Nitish Kumar Reddy**: The debutant all-rounder scored 41 in the first innings and an unbeaten 39 in the second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:15:"></a>. He displayed free-flowing shots and took the attack to the Aussies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:20:"></a>. This was described as a "dream debut" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:30:"></a>.

## Australia's Struggles
Australia's top four batting lineup is considered "in tatters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:30:"></a>. Only Travis Head scored over 50 (89 in the fourth innings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:24:"></a>. Their aggregate top-order runs in the Test were 342 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07:"></a>.
*   **Nathan McSweeney**: Was a gamble as an opener and struggled against Bumrah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:56:"></a>.
*   **Usman Khawaja**: Had an off game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:04:"></a>, but is seen as deserving of more chances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:59:"></a>.
*   **Marnus Labuschagne**: Struggled immensely, unable to "buy a run" and getting hit on the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:08:"></a>. He was dropped on a duck but failed to capitalize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:16:"></a>. There's a suggestion that Australia might need to give him a break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:21:"></a>.
*   **Steve Smith**: His first innings dismissal raised questions about his eyesight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:19:"></a>, as his usual shuffling technique did not connect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:31:"></a>. However, he looked better in the second innings, seeing the ball well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:01:"></a>.
*   **Josh Hazlewood**: Was "damn brilliant" with 4 for 29 in the first innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:54:"></a>. His performance was "incredible in an innings where the Australian bowlers didn't get as much out of the surface as they could have" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:09:"></a>. He is highly underrated and has been the second-best all-format bowler after Bumrah over the last four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:56:"></a>.
*   **Australian Bowling**: Beyond Hazlewood, the attack looked "lackluster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:13:"></a>. Mitchell Starc had good rhythm but wasn't effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00:"></a>, while Pat Cummins "really struggled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:05:"></a>. Nathan Lyon also had an off-match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:42:"></a>. The team failed to take 20 wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:40:"></a>, which is crucial against [[indias_dominance_in_odi_cricket | India]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:42:"></a>. Australia's bench strength, particularly in batting, is a concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:55:"></a>.

## Implications and Future Outlook
This victory propels [[indias_dominance_in_odi_cricket | India]] back into contention for the World Test Championship final <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:02:"></a>. While Australia faces significant batting challenges, particularly at the top, [[indias_dominance_in_odi_cricket | India]] possesses strong bench strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:55:"></a>. The series is set to become even more enthralling with the upcoming pink ball Test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:44:"></a>. The unexpected results in international cricket this year make the sport incredibly exciting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:57:"></a>.

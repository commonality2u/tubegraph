Australia has faced significant challenges and employed various strategies in recent Test cricket, particularly against India. These include issues with batting form, bowling tactics, and adapting to changing pitch conditions.

## Batting Struggles

Australia's batting lineup has shown significant vulnerabilities, contributing to their struggles in recent matches.
*   **Overall Performance:** At one point, Australia appeared "dead" and "getting smashed" in a Test match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.
*   **Top Order Issues:** Concerns were raised about Usman Khawaja's form, Matthew Kuhnemann opening, and the struggles of Marnus Labuschagne and Steve Smith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>. The question remains how Australia can fix their top four batting problem without two players finding form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>.
*   **Lack of Quality Batters:** The Australian domestic cricket system is currently not producing enough high-quality batters for the national team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:23">[00:54:23]</a>. The absence of a player like Will Pucovski, who was seen as "the next big thing," highlights a missing generation of batting talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:29">[00:54:29]</a>.
*   **Impact of Conditions:** The "Kookaburra ball being reinforced" has led to a drop in Shield averages, and many Shield pitches are played for results rather than fostering batting development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:44">[00:54:44]</a>.

## Bowling Tactics and Performance

Australia's bowling unit, while generally strong, has sometimes struggled with consistency and tactical flexibility.
*   **Day-to-Day Variation:** In one specific match, the bowling average on Day 1 was 12.76, Day 2 was 69.67, and Day 3 was 36.33, indicating widely varied pitch conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **Strategic Choices:**
    *   **Marnus Labuschagne's Bowling:** Labuschagne was used as a "budget Neil Wagner" but then abandoned bowling bouncers in favor of wide deliveries down the leg side to deliberately slow down Virat Kohli, possibly to avoid batting in shadows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Bowling wides on purpose is considered "death" for a team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. His weird pace bowling was also noted, with pacers being shielded from Wagner-like duties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
    *   **Patience and Attack:** Australia showed patience and bowled better on a more helpful wicket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. They bowled fuller and more attacking, aiming for wickets for a significant period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
    *   **Short Ball Hesitation:** Australian bowlers seem reluctant to consistently use the short ball, possibly to avoid tiring themselves out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>.
*   **Captaincy under Pat Cummins:** Under Pat Cummins' captaincy, the highest team score against Australia in Australia has been 333 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. This suggests that teams have generally not been "cruising and making lots of runs" against them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.
    *   **Pragmatic Approach:** Cummins' captaincy style is described as pragmatic and patient, believing a false shot will eventually come. He relies heavily on pre-approved plans and is less inclined to change tactics on the field compared to captains like MS Dhoni or Ben Stokes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>.
    *   **Decision to Not Bowl Bouncers:** A key moment in one match was Cummins' failure to "throw out the script" and bowl bouncers for half an hour when the game was getting away from them, which put them behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:34">[00:31:34]</a>.
*   **New Ball Strategy:** There's a debate about whether Cummins should take the new ball to regain rhythm, moving Josh Hazlewood to first change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. However, Mitchell Starc has recently looked good with the new ball, making it difficult to shift him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:58">[00:38:58]</a>. An alternative strategy is to have Starc bowl with the new ball for just three overs, with Hazlewood coming on to share the new ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:20">[00:40:20]</a>.

## Nightwatchman Decisions

Australia's use of a nightwatchman has come under scrutiny.
*   Pat Cummins was sent out as a nightwatchman too early, making it look negative and a "horrible decision" given the new ball and the quality of bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>.
*   The conventional role of a nightwatchman is to face a limited number of balls (5-15) to prevent a new batter from coming in late in the day; this was not achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:28">[00:35:28]</a>.

## Overall Series Dynamics and Future Outlook

Despite early struggles, [[Australias cricket strategy and performance in ODI World Cup 2023 | Australia]] are known for their mental strength and ability to bounce back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:49">[00:54:49]</a>. However, the current series is a long one, and [[Competitive dynamics in test cricket between India and Australia | Australia's top four problems]] and bowling hesitations regarding the short ball could persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>. The presence of a pink ball Test (Day-Night) introduces an element of randomness and extreme results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>.

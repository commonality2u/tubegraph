From: [[goodareaslive]] <br/> 

The India versus England Test series concluded with India securing an easy 4-1 victory, despite playing with a depleted squad that included backup players and several seamers with limited Test experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. The series was played on flat wickets, highlighting India's strong performance even in challenging conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. While the scoreline of 4-1 suggests a dominant win, the series was more competitive than it appears, with England often losing key moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.

## India Player Performances

### Ravichandran Ashwin
Initially, there was skepticism about Ravichandran Ashwin's form, with his average around 38-39 in the first seven innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. However, since then, his average improved significantly to 12.8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. A key factor in this improvement was his effectiveness with the new ball, which allowed him to slide the ball through more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

One notable wicket was that of Crawley, where the ball showed 10.4 degrees of turn on Hawkeye, and over five degrees of turn in general, which is considered "ragging" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Ashwin skillfully worked the ball, with one ball drifting, another going straight, and a third getting an inside edge to dismiss Crawley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. He also secured the wicket of Pope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

### Jasprit Bumrah
Jasprit Bumrah had an exceptional series, taking 19 wickets at an average of 16.89 and a strike rate of 32.7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. This performance stands out among pacers with at least 15 wickets in a series in India during the 21st century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

### Kuldeep Yadav
Kuldeep Yadav displayed a knack for getting the ball to keep low, more so than other wrist spinners, even on wickets that weren't inherently low-keeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Many of his wickets, including those of Stokes, Crawley, Ryan Ahmed, Bairstow, and Duckett, came from deliveries played off the back foot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. England's strategy of playing him off the back foot sometimes led to dismissals, especially when the ball spun back into the stumps, creating LBW opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

## England Player Performances

### Joe Root
Joe Root struggled in the early part of the series, scoring only 77 runs in his first six innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. However, he found form in his last four innings, amassing 243 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. His improved [[player_performance_analysis_in_test_cricket | batting performance]] coincided with him bowling fewer overs later in the series, though it's unclear how much this contributed to his turnaround <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. His later innings were described as "proper Joe Root innings," characterized by milking the leg side and playing off the back foot against spinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

### Ben Stokes
Ben Stokes's away form since 2021 has been a concern, with consistently low averages: 27 in New Zealand, 35 in Pakistan, 23 in Australia, 25 in India (previous tour), and 32 in the West Indies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. In this series, he averaged 19.9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. His technique against spin bowling in Asia, especially when the ball moves away from him, is not particularly well-suited due to his bat path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. He also struggles to use his feet effectively against spinners and is less confident with his main shot, the slug sweep, in Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. His overall away average contributes significantly to keeping his career average down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

### James Anderson
At 41 years old, James Anderson continues to perform remarkably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. He took a wicket against Shubman Gill by getting into his head and outfoxing him with knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. In the second innings, despite his age, he bowled a bouncer to Kuldeep Yadav, unsettling him and taking his wicket the very next ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.

Anderson has had a career spanning 21-22 years, reaching 700 Test wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>. No other seamer has had such a long career or taken as many wickets; Imran Khan, who had a similar career length, ended with 362 wickets and was an all-rounder who barely bowled towards the end of his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>. Anderson's achievement is considered "remarkable" and likely unprecedented in cricket history, especially given modern game changes and player management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.

### Ben Duckett
Ben Duckett's dismissal was analyzed in detail. According to Cricfit, he had not left his crease against spinners all series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>. However, in his dismissal, he moved down the wicket prematurely before Ashwin had delivered the ball, regardless of line or length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>. He ended up significantly out of position, making it difficult to connect with the ball, which was foot and a half outside leg stump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.

Duckett's decision to charge was influenced by Ashwin's dominant record: an average of 18.57 against all batters in the first 10 overs in India, 17.76 in the second innings, and 14.46 against left-handers with the new ball in the second innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>. More specifically, Ashwin averaged 6.5 against Duckett in the second innings in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>.

His brain was "fried" by previous deliveries: an early sweep attempt that didn't work and a normal forward defense that resulted in an inside edge, almost leading to a catch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>. This mental pressure led him to decide to charge down the wicket without properly assessing the ball's trajectory, resulting in his dismissal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:14">[00:25:14]</a>.

## Series Overview

### Bazball Strategy
England's "Bazball" approach, at its core, aims to make their team competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. While they lost 4-1 in this series (and 3-1 previously), they were competitive throughout the five Tests, a significant improvement from their previous series where they "simply were not at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. India had to actively work to counter their tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

Despite the loss, Bazball allowed England's less experienced spinners to take 40 wickets, their openers performed repeatedly, and even their "worst player of spin" almost scored a double hundred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. It's suggested that England might have gained more than they would have playing "normal Cricket," and perhaps combining the best of Bazball with more sensible cricket would yield even better results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

The two major flaws with Bazball identified are the inability to consistently make enough runs in the first innings to pressure opponents and the reliance on four frontline bowlers without a solid all-rounder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:39">[00:30:39]</a>.

### Pitch Conditions
India played on "flat wickets" for much of the series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. These "even" pitches are seen as beneficial for India, potentially leading to fewer "fluky results" compared to highly spinning tracks previously seen against England or Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>. The pitches in this series were described as "absolutely sensational" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:13]</a>.

### Player Interactions
A notable moment of "Bazball" occurred in an exchange between Shubman Gill and Jonny Bairstow, chronicled by "RAV man" on Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. Bairstow questioned Gill about his comments to Jimmy Anderson regarding retirement. Gill retorted with "Retire Bairstow." When Bairstow then dismissed Gill, Gill's response was, "So what? He can get me out for a hundred. How many hundreds did you score?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a> This interaction highlighted Bairstow's attempt to embarrass Gill over his dismissal by Anderson, but Gill's century meant his wicket wasn't a significant win for England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. The exchange ended with Bairstow seemingly losing his composure, which mirrored England's overall performance in the series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

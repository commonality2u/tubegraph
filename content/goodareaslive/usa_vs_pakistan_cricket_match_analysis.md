The cricket match between the USA and Pakistan was described as an "incredible game" and "quite clearly one of the biggest upsets in the cricket of history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">00:02:18</a>. Both teams experienced moments of dominance and panic, with both "choked at different times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">00:01:55</a>. The USA, playing in their first World Cup, emerged victorious against Pakistan, a team that has previously won a World Cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">00:02:01</a>.

## Pakistan's Innings

Pakistan's innings was characterized by early pressure from the USA bowlers and consistent wicket-taking.

### Early Wickets and USA's Strategy
The USA started strong in the power play, prioritizing wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">00:05:20</a>.
*   **Steven Taylor's Catch** A "world-class catch" by Steven Taylor removed [[Mohammad Rizwan]], a crucial wicket that set the tone for the USA's innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">00:03:47</a>.
*   **[[Fakhar Zaman]]'s Dismissal** [[Fakhar Zaman]]'s paddle shot, despite his aggressive start, went straight to a fielder, resulting in another critical wicket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">00:04:06</a>.
*   **Power Play Success** The USA secured "three wickets in the power play" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">00:04:51</a>, putting them in a strong position. Saurabh Netravalkar was particularly effective during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">00:05:37</a>.
*   **Pace and Spin Mix** The USA's decision to open the bowling with spin against Pakistan in a World Cup at home highlighted how much cricket has evolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">00:06:42</a>.

### Mid-Innings Slowdown and Collapse
Pakistan struggled to maintain momentum due to effective USA bowling and fielding.
*   **[[Babar Azam]]'s Anchor Role** [[Babar Azam]] scored 44 runs off 43 balls, with a strike rate of 102.32, batting for over an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">00:07:11</a>. While critical for Pakistan's total, it was considered a "slow innings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">00:07:28</a>, with the USA's varied bowling restricting him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">00:07:35</a>.
*   **[[Shadab Khan]]'s Impact** [[Shadab Khan]]'s quickfire 40 off 25 balls, including three sixes, seemed to turn the tide for Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">00:08:36</a>.
*   **Pakistan's Rebuild Efforts** Just as Pakistan looked set to accelerate, they lost two crucial wickets, including [[Shadab Khan]] and [[Azam Khan]], forcing them to rebuild their innings again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">00:09:44</a>.
*   **USA's Consistent Wickets** The USA's ability to take wickets consistently throughout the innings prevented Pakistan from building significant partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">00:10:29</a>.
*   **Final Score** Pakistan finished their innings with 159 runs, which was below the perceived pass score of 180 on that wicket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">00:11:00</a>.

## USA's Chase

The USA's chase saw them build a strong foundation despite facing Pakistan's formidable pace attack.

### Confident Start
*   **Pakistan's Bowling Struggles** Pakistan's bowlers, known for their pace, struggled to find their rhythm and were unsure of their best ball on the pitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">00:11:54</a>. This allowed the USA to score freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">00:12:00</a>.
*   **Easing into the Chase** The USA reached 36 runs in 5.1 overs, comfortably setting themselves up for the chase without needing to force the pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">00:12:12</a>.
*   **Key Partnership** A significant partnership between Andries Gous and Monank Patel took the score from 36 to 104 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">00:13:24</a>. This allowed subsequent batters to play cameos rather than carrying a massive load <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">00:14:00</a>.

### Pakistan's Fightback and USA's Resilience
Pakistan fought back, but their discipline in fielding and bowling extras proved costly.
*   **Reverse Swing** When the ball was changed, Pakistan's bowlers managed to get it to reverse swing almost instantly, creating difficulties for the USA batters unaccustomed to such pace and movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">00:14:26</a>.
*   **Wides and Fielding Errors** Pakistan bowled seven more wides than the USA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">00:15:12</a>. Their fielding errors and wides allowed the USA to stay in the game despite the increased bowling pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">00:15:46</a>.
*   **Lack of Spin Options** Pakistan's diminished spin bowling attack, with [[Shadab Khan]] conceding 27 runs in three overs and Iftekhar Ahmed 10 in one, meant they couldn't effectively "lock down parts of the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">00:17:05</a>.
*   **Aaron Jones's Crucial Six** Aaron Jones hit a crucial six in the final overs, after being dropped earlier by Shadab Afridi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">00:17:49</a>.
*   **Haris Rauf's Last Ball** Haris Rauf's final delivery in the regular innings "didn't stick The Landing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">00:18:07</a>, leading to the scores being tied and forcing a Super Over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">00:18:22</a>.

## The Super Over

The Super Over was a dramatic affair, ultimately decided by execution and composure.

### USA's Batting
*   **Early Boundary Impact** The USA's theory of hitting an early boundary in the Super Over proved effective, freeing up the batters and allowing them to focus on accumulating twos if big shots weren't available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">00:21:20</a>.
*   **Pakistan's Errors** [[Mohammad Amir]]'s wide bowling, coupled with [[Mohammad Rizwan]]'s struggles to collect them, led to each wide being "worth double what it should have been" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">00:23:01</a>.
*   **Overthrow** A "shambolic" moment occurred when [[Mohammad Rizwan]]'s attempt to throw the ball back to Amir, while USA batters were out of their crease, went over his head, gifting the USA an extra run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">00:23:33</a>.
*   **USA's Target** The USA managed to score 18 runs (or close to it) with only one boundary in the Super Over, without having to panic or over-hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">00:24:02</a>.

### Pakistan's Chase
*   **USA's Bowling Selection** The USA opted for Saurabh Netravalkar, a left-arm bowler, over the seemingly better Ali Khan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">00:24:32</a>.
*   **Netravalkar's Accuracy** Netravalkar bowled accurately, keeping the ball on the right side of the wide line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">00:25:11</a>.
*   **Monank Patel's Wicketkeeping** Captain Monank Patel's effective wicketkeeping was a "huge difference" in the Super Over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">00:25:13</a>.
*   **Execution** Ultimately, Netravalkar's last ball was "just better than Haris Rauf's last ball" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">00:25:36</a>, with the USA bowler executing his plan while Pakistan's could not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">00:25:53</a>.

## Broader Context and Implications

### "Quadr Kart Naim" and Pakistan's Unpredictability
The concept of "Quadr Kart Naim," a theory in Pakistan cricket that "things kind of happened for Pakistan for everything to come together at the right time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">00:26:45</a>, was discussed. This loss raises the question of whether this was the "anti-quadrat card his arm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">00:29:09</a> or another example of Pakistan's "dark Origins Story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:49">00:30:49</a>, where they start poorly but make a spectacular comeback in a tournament (e.g., 1992 and 1999 World Cups) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">00:30:31</a>.

A bizarre incident involving two runs being taken off Pakistan's score in their innings (due to the umpire deeming the ball dead after a dropped run-out attempt) contrasted with a Super Over incident where [[Mohammad Rizwan]]'s overthrow resulted in an extra run for the USA, highlighting the "murky weird conversation" around cricket's archaic laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">00:29:52</a>.

### The Rise of USA Cricket
This victory is significant for USA Cricket, given its turbulent history:
*   **Administrative Disarray** The USA Cricket administration has been in "complete disarray" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08">00:31:08</a>.
*   **Major League Cricket** The Major League Cricket, intended to boost cricket in the USA, almost failed to materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">00:31:12</a>.
*   **Mixed Recent Form** The USA has shown flashes of brilliance, beating Test teams like Ireland and Bangladesh, but also struggled in other matches, such as nearly losing to Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:22">00:31:22</a>.
*   **Historical Context** The USA has a rich history in cricket, with figures like Benjamin Franklin and George Washington involved in the sport in the 1800s, before it faded away around 1908 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:12">00:32:12</a>.
*   **Beating Pakistan** Defeating Pakistan is seen as a "dramatic and more fun" way to "start your journey into the next level of cricket," as seen with teams like Ireland and Bangladesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">00:32:46</a>. Pakistan is characterized as the "firecracker team" that often gives opponents a chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">00:33:04</a>.

The USA's team, composed of "semi-amateurs," "semi-professionals," and "former professionals from other countries getting Second Chances," came together to produce this "incredible T20 game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">00:33:16</a>. This victory now gives the USA an "outside chance" of advancing to the second round of the tournament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:05">00:34:05</a>.

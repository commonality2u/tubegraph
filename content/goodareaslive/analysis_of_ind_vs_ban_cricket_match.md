The match between India and Bangladesh, which started with Bangladesh hoping to put on a good show, saw India eventually win easily. While Bangladesh initially struggled, they managed to put up a fight with an "epic partnership" that extended their defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, allowing their bowlers, who are considered the good part of their cricket, something to work with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The game was considered "less interesting" than the previous one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## India's Performance

### Key Indian Players

#### Muhammad Shami
[[Muhammad Shami|Muhammad Shami]] continues to be effective in taking wickets in ODIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. He is described as a "fantastic bowler" and forms a "great Duo" with [[Jasprit Bumrah|Jasprit Bumrah]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. He is considered the "best attacking bowler" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a> and recently achieved 200 wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. When playing alongside [[Jasprit Bumrah|Jasprit Bumrah]], he takes a wicket every 19 balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, with an economy of 5.76 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

Adjusted for era, [[Muhammad Shami|Muhammad Shami]] is ranked as the "best strike bowler in the history of ODI Cricket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>, taking a wicket every 25.1 deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. He is compared closely with Ajanta Mendis and Waqar Younis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, having a slightly better economy than Waqar Younis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

**ICC Events Performance:**
[[Muhammad Shami|Muhammad Shami]] is identified as an "ICC force" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
*   **Games at ICC events**: 18.3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>
*   **Wickets in ICC events**: 29.7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>
*   **Bilateral Record**: 142 wickets, economy 5.67, averages two wickets per game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. This is still considered a great record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **ICC Event Record**: 60 wickets, economy 5.14, takes a wicket every 15.5 deliveries (approximately every three overs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

#### Jasprit Bumrah
[[Jasprit Bumrah|Jasprit Bumrah]] is noted as "probably the greatest white ball bowler we've ever had" and the "best defensive bowler" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. He takes a wicket every 36 balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a> and has an economy of 4.67 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

#### Shubman Gill
[[Shubman Gill|Shubman Gill]]'s performance in ODI Cricket since the start of 2022:
*   **Batting Average**: 33.42 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>
*   **Strike Rate**: 97.46 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>

He faces fewer dot balls than expected (17% better against dot balls) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. He is "plus on every metric against spin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>, being almost twice as likely to hit a six against spin as anyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. Against pace, his fours increase while sixes remain normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>. He's also "absolutely brilliant at scoring singles" against pace bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>.

#### Virat Kohli
[[Virat Kohli|Virat Kohli]]'s performance against leg spin in the last 14 months (over six or seven games):
*   Faced 46 balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>
*   Dismissed every nine balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>
In 2023, this was not an issue, as he faced 170 balls from leg spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>. His varied performance is attributed to him "playing around with how he plays spin" due to struggles in Test Cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.

#### Kuldeep Yadav & Varun Chakravarthy
India's bowling choices, particularly between [[Kuldeep Yadav|Kuldeep Yadav]] and Varun Chakravarthy, are debated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.
[[Kuldeep Yadav|Kuldeep Yadav]] has 174 wickets and is a great strike bowler, taking a wicket every 31.4 balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>. However, he is considered "a step away from his best" due to injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.
Varun Chakravarthy has found a level of bowling that white-ball bowlers rarely achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. Teams are not handling him well in List A cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. The ideal scenario would be for both to bowl, but this presents fielding and batting problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. Both are considered among the top 4-8 ODI spinners globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. The speaker would choose Varun Chakravarthy over [[Kuldeep Yadav|Kuldeep Yadav]] for now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>.

#### Arshdeep Singh & Harshit Rana
India's decision to use only two specialist seam bowlers, with [[Hardik Pandya|Hardik Pandya]] as a third option, leads to selection challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.
*   **[[Arshdeep Singh|Arshdeep Singh]]**: Good at taking wickets in the bowling powerplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>, but can go for runs in the middle overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. In IPL/T20 Internationals, he's best in the powerplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. He might be considered "a little loose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>.
*   **Harshit Rana**: Good in the middle overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>, but goes for runs in the powerplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. In IPL/T20 Internationals, he's best in the middle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. He fits the template of a "strong bowler" who can bowl at 145-150 km/h into the surface, providing inconsistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. This type of bowler is sought after to complement spinners in the middle overs when fielders are spread out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:57">[00:38:57]</a>.

The choice depends on whether they need a powerplay bowler (like [[Arshdeep Singh|Arshdeep Singh]]) or a middle-overs bowler (like Harshit Rana) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>.

#### KL Rahul
[[KL Rahul|KL Rahul]] is considered a "downgrade" as a wicket-keeper compared to [[Rishabh Pant|Rishabh Pant]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>, with [[Rishabh Pant|Rishabh Pant]] rated a couple of tiers higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>. However, [[KL Rahul|KL Rahul]] as an ODI batter is appreciated for how he plays and fits into the side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>.

### India's Bowling Strategy
India failed to take any wickets between overs 10 and 40, reminiscent of the World Cup final <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. This performance raised questions about their optimal bowler usage and placement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. The pitch conditions likely influenced this, as it was noted to be trickier than it appeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

## Bangladesh's Performance

### Batting Struggles
Bangladesh's batting lineup is described as "dreadful" and "horrendous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. One spectator who believed Bangladesh had a chance at semi-finals was met with "Exhibit A" of their poor performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

*   **Liton Das**: Had a batting average of 1.2 in six or five ODIs last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Despite being among their six most talented players, he's not picked because he fails to score runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

**Top Six Batting Average & Strike Rate (since 2022, Champions Trophy teams):**
Bangladesh's top six batsmen have a batting average of 29 and a strike rate of less than 80, which is significantly lower than other teams like India (average 45, strike rate almost a run a ball) and Australia (average 37, strike rate almost a run a ball) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

**Top Three Batting Average & Strike Rate (since 2022):**
Their top three average 27.38, while India's top three average 48 and Australia's 43 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Bangladesh is scoring few runs and doing so slowly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

#### Hridoy (Ridoy)
Hridoy played well in 2023, showcasing his potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. He is expected to average in the high 30s or low 40s at his peak, with a strike rate around 80-85 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. He rebuilt the innings for a long period and showed resilience even while battling cramps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. A notable moment was him cramping mid-dive during a run and needing help from the umpire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

#### Jak Ali
Jak Ali's batting method is unique and tactical, involving backing away or moving across the crease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. This movement makes it difficult for bowlers to establish a consistent line against him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. His actions are not solely to create room for a shot but also to "put the bowler off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

## Pitch Conditions
The pitch was described as "a little bit trickier" than it looked on first glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. It was particularly tough to bat on in the middle period once the luster came off the ball and fielders spread out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>. The ball wasn't always coming on at the pace batters expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>. The pitch was better suited for wrist spinners than finger spinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:29">[00:30:29]</a>. These factors could be relevant if the venue hosts semi-finals or finals later in the tournament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>.

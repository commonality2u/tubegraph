*   **Tatenda Taibu** cut the top off his bat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   **Colin Taylor** used a hockey grip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   **Steve Smith**'s technique was influenced by tennis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   **Dean Jones** would call phantom runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   **Victor Trumper** turned nets into a "war zone" to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Second Round Matchups

The first round of the knockout competition features several compelling [[comparison_of_cricket_legends | comparisons of cricket legends]].

### Virat Kohli vs. Neil Harvey
*   **Winner:** Virat Kohli (unanimous) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>
*   **Neil Harvey:** Although eliminated, he was lauded for starting his Test career "as great as anyone has ever started" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. He was a brilliant left-hander against off-spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Despite some "holes in his record" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, he had a good run in the competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

### Victor Trumper vs. Sunil Gavaskar
*   **Winner:** Sunil Gavaskar (unanimous) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>
*   **Victor Trumper:** Praised as possibly the "best wet wicket player of all time" and "one of the best attacking players of all time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   **Sunil Gavaskar:** Considered on a "completely different level" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. He is one of the "best players of spin of all time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>, averaged 50+ as an opener (a "very rare feat") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>, and was the first to score 10,000 Test runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

### Garfield Sobers vs. Ricky Ponting
*   **Winner:** Garfield Sobers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>
*   **Ricky Ponting:** Had a strong peak, but outside of it, he was "okay" when young and "below average" when old, with his average sustained by a "great batting era" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Garfield Sobers:** Had "more weapons" and "more power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>, averaged more than Ponting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>, and had "fewer flaws" in his record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. His significant bowling workload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a> meant he would have averaged even more if he had batted higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Sobers also had "one of the greatest peaks of all time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

### Don Bradman vs. Geoff Boycott
*   **Winner:** Don Bradman (unanimous) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>
*   **Geoff Boycott:** Despite his controversial personality, he was a "fantastic player" and "underestimated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Compared to Gavaskar, Gavaskar is considered better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. Both put a "really high price on their wicket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

### Steve Smith vs. Mahela Jayawardene
*   **Winner:** Steve Smith (unanimous) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>
*   **Mahela Jayawardene:** While one of the "greatest players against spin of all time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, his record against spin was not as fantastic as initially believed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. He had a technical flaw with his backlift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. His attractiveness to watch was noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>, but Smith's "weirdness" is also highly entertaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

### Clive Lloyd vs. Ken Barrington
*   **Winner:** Ken Barrington <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>
*   **Clive Lloyd:** A "great player" but not at Barrington's level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. He batted mostly at number five <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a> and possessed a "coolness factor" and "power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   **Ken Barrington:** His Test record is "incredible," averaging 58 from 82 matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. Despite high praise from some, analysis showed he made runs against "fairly ordinary attacks" and didn't dominate first-class cricket in England as expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:45">[00:29:45]</a>. He faced few truly great bowlers consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>.

### Javed Miandad vs. WG Grace
*   **Winner:** Javed Miandad (split vote, but won) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>
*   **Javed Miandad:** Never averaged below 50 in his entire Test career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>, played 120 Tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>, and brought a "mad genius vibe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. Played in a tougher bowling era than Younis Khan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:37">[00:33:37]</a>.
*   **WG Grace:** Could be slotted "anywhere" in a list of [[great_batters_in_cricket_history | great batters in cricket history]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. Started playing Test cricket in his 30s while being a full-time doctor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>, and continued to be a top batter into his 40s, retiring near 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. If he had played earlier, he might have averaged 55 when others averaged 25, a "Bradman-like level" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. Didn't make himself available for all Tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. Both players were considered "super villains" for their on-field antics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

### Younis Khan vs. Steve Waugh
*   **Winner:** Younis Khan (unanimous) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>
*   **Steve Waugh:** Played at number five, where batting is a "dream" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. His not-outs and reluctance to bat higher when the team needed him to were noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. His desire to average 50 was seen as a "motivation opposite" to playing solely to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.
*   **Younis Khan:** Had a strong case even without considering Waugh's context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>, and often batted at number three for Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

### Jack Hobbs vs. Greg Chappell
*   **Winner:** Jack Hobbs (unanimous) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>
*   **Greg Chappell:** An "absolute great" but not as "well tested" as others from his era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>, missing runs due to World Series Cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. Known for "technical brilliance and elegance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.
*   **Jack Hobbs:** Jack Hobbs is "Jack Hobbs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>, implying his status is self-evident.

### Allan Border vs. Len Hutton
*   **Winner:** Len Hutton (unanimous) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>
*   **Allan Border:** A "great player" who averaged 50 away from home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>, played the West Indies at their peak, and was a "warrior" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>.
*   **Len Hutton:** "Just better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>. His record is "almost impeccable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>, looking "perfect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>. He broke the world record before WWII, missed his 20s due to the war, lost an inch off his elbow due to injury, but returned to dominate again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:14">[00:35:14]</a>. He averaged highly in various countries and was known for not making mistakes and playing the right shot consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:35:36]</a>.

### Michael Clarke vs. George Headley
*   **Winner:** George Headley (unanimous) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>
*   **Michael Clarke:** Had a "good run" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a> to make it to this round.
*   **George Headley:** The "Black Bradman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">[00:37:42]</a>, who unfortunately "didn't play as much as he should have" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:45">[00:37:45]</a>. His first 19 Tests were "insane" with high runs and batting average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>.

### VVS Laxman vs. Viv Richards
*   **Winner:** Viv Richards (unanimous) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>
*   **VVS Laxman:** Had a "good run" to the second round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>. His "overall record's not very good" on some metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. He was probably a number three or four in any other team but played lower for India due to other top batters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.

### Sachin Tendulkar vs. Kumar Sangakkara
*   **Winner:** Sachin Tendulkar (unanimous) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>
*   **Kumar Sangakkara:** Sri Lanka's "best batter ever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a> and has a "very good case of being a top 10 batter of all time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>. Unlucky to face Sachin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>.

### Brian Lara vs. Joe Root
*   **Winner:** Brian Lara (unanimous) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>
*   **Joe Root:** Moved up five positions in the book due to his consistent run-scoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:59">[00:21:59]</a>. He could continue to climb higher in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>.

### AB de Villiers vs. Alastair Cook
*   **Winner:** AB de Villiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a>
*   **AB de Villiers:** Played an attacking style, averaged 50, was versatile, and kept wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>.
*   **Alastair Cook:** An opener in England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>. Both players retired relatively young <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>.

### Matthew Hayden vs. Jacques Kallis
*   **Winner:** Jacques Kallis (unanimous) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>
*   **Matthew Hayden:** Could change a game "way quicker" than Kallis and had more "fear factor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>. He was dropped and returned to play in his prime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.
*   **Jacques Kallis:** The "most underrated batter and the most overrated bowler of all time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>. Averaged around 55 in Test cricket and had the second-most centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>. His fast bowling workload was also a factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>.

## Round of 16 Matchups

### Virat Kohli vs. Sunil Gavaskar
*   **Winner:** Sunil Gavaskar (unanimous) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>
*   **Virat Kohli:** If he had continued to age in a "normal great player way," he would have come close to Gavaskar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. His easier home conditions were mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>.
*   **Sunil Gavaskar:** Remained good until the very end of his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>.

### Garfield Sobers vs. Don Bradman
*   **Winner:** Don Bradman (unanimous) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>

### Steve Smith vs. Ken Barrington
*   **Winner:** Steve Smith (unanimous) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>
*   **Ken Barrington:** His road "comes to an end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:24">[00:29:24]</a>. Despite impressive statistics (average 58 in 82 Tests) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>, scrutiny of his opposition and first-class record reveals limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:45">[00:29:45]</a>. He played in an era without as many great attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>. His test averages in different countries were remarkably high, but his first-class average was lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>.

### Javed Miandad vs. Younis Khan
*   **Winner:** Javed Miandad (split vote) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>
*   **Javed Miandad:** Chosen for his consistent 50+ average that never dropped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:26">[00:33:26]</a> and playing in a "tougher period" against "tougher bowlers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>.
*   **Younis Khan:** Although close in the book's ranking, Miandad's longevity and consistency against tougher eras were prioritized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.

### Jack Hobbs vs. Len Hutton
*   **Winner:** Jack Hobbs (unanimous) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a>
*   **Len Hutton:** A "very harsh bracket" to face Hobbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>. His record was nearly "perfect" despite breaking a world record, missing his 20s due to WWII, and playing with an injured elbow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>. Known for making no mistakes and playing the right shot consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:35:36]</a>.

### George Headley vs. Viv Richards
*   **Winner:** Viv Richards (unanimous) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>
*   **George Headley:** "Very unlucky" to be eliminated, acknowledged as one of the "greatest players of all time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a>. His batting average was higher than Viv's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:57">[00:37:57]</a>.
*   **Viv Richards:** His ability to "change a game so violently" was unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:19">[00:46:19]</a>. He was great in England and Australia, and possibly the "best player all time against extreme pace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:26">[00:46:26]</a>.

### Sachin Tendulkar vs. Brian Lara
*   **Winner:** Sachin Tendulkar (unanimous) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>
*   **Brian Lara:** Known for his immense talent, but his peak was sometimes affected by outside interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:04">[00:40:04]</a>. However, he could return to greatness overnight when motivated by his legacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:15">[00:40:15]</a>. Described as more capable of playing a "great innings tomorrow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>. He "needed something to make him great" but then found a level possibly "even above Sachin's" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:09">[00:41:09]</a>.
*   **Sachin Tendulkar:** "Great every single day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:20">[00:40:20]</a>, with exceptional longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>. He was consistently great across all stages of his career (teenage, 20s-30s, 35+) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>. He averaged over 40 in every country he played in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:11">[00:42:11]</a>.

### AB de Villiers vs. Jacques Kallis
*   **Winner:** Jacques Kallis (unanimous) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:40">[00:42:40]</a>
*   **AB de Villiers:** Could have been a "better player than Kallis, but he wasn't" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>.
*   **Jacques Kallis:** Considered the "best batter in Test cricket to come out of South Africa" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:59">[00:42:59]</a>.

## Quarterfinals Matchups

### Sunil Gavaskar vs. Don Bradman
*   **Winner:** Don Bradman (unanimous) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>
*   **Sunil Gavaskar:** Had a "really good run" to the quarterfinals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:26">[00:44:26]</a>, and ending up in the top eight is considered "almost perfect" for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:37">[00:44:37]</a>.

### Steve Smith vs. Javed Miandad
*   **Winner:** Steve Smith (unanimous) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:09">[00:45:09]</a>
*   **Javed Miandad:** Had a "great run" but "does not deserve to be in this semi-final" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:58">[00:44:58]</a>, having benefited from a favorable bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:18">[00:45:18]</a>.

### Jack Hobbs vs. Viv Richards
*   **Winner:** Jack Hobbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:38">[00:45:38]</a>
*   **Viv Richards:** While a terrifying and game-changing player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>, his "naked numbers" were not as high without considering his strike rate and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>.

### Sachin Tendulkar vs. Jacques Kallis
*   **Winner:** Sachin Tendulkar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:41">[00:47:41]</a>
*   **Jacques Kallis:** Considered "lucky to make the quarterfinals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:49">[00:47:49]</a>, but a quarterfinal finish is deemed "fair" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:53">[00:47:53]</a>.

*   **Steve Smith:** His ranking could still go higher in the coming years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:14">[00:50:14]</a>. At the time of recording, he had four hundreds in his last five Test matches, showing his return to form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:23">[00:50:23]</a>.

*   **Winner:** Sachin Tendulkar (unanimous) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:06">[00:49:06]</a>
*   **Jack Hobbs:** Described as having "remarkable" numbers, similar to Bradman before World War I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:21">[00:49:21]</a>. He continued to dominate after the war, playing for over 20 years and remaining competitive against younger legends while in his 40s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:29">[00:49:29]</a>. He may have been the player who wanted to score runs more than anyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:57">[00:49:57]</a>.

## The Grand Final

### Don Bradman vs. Sachin Tendulkar
*   **Winner:** Don Bradman (unanimous) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:54">[00:50:54]</a>

### Final Verdict: Don Bradman

The final matchup was deemed the "right matchup" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>, with **Don Bradman** emerging as the undisputed [[greatest_test_batters_of_all_time | greatest test batter of all time]].

*   **Don Bradman:** His average of 99.94 (or 99.97 debated) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:02">[00:51:02]</a> makes it impossible to compete with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:56">[00:50:56]</a>. He has a case for being number one, but "doesn't have a case for being number two" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:21">[00:51:21]</a>. While critics point to the era he played in, no one else averaged "40 more than the next greatest batter of their era" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a>. He averaged almost double what other great players did for his entire career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:06">[00:52:06]</a>. He missed peak years due to World War II but still averaged more after the war despite potential vision issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:06">[00:54:06]</a>. He is on a level that "we will never see again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>. From 1877 to 2000, there was no comparable batter to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:54">[00:54:54]</a>. He averaged highly against England and in Shield cricket against strong bowling lineups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:38">[00:55:38]</a>.

*   **Sachin Tendulkar:** While an all-time great, there are still people who pick Lara over him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:40">[00:54:40]</a>, which doesn't happen with Bradman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">[00:54:47]</a>. Sachin played in an era with other players of "similar skill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:16">[00:55:16]</a>, unlike Bradman.

## Reflections on the Competition and "The Art of Batting"

The hosts acknowledge that the result was unsurprising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a> but emphasize the purpose of the book: to showcase the "many great batters" and "many different kinds of great batters" throughout cricket history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:20">[00:56:20]</a>. The list in the book is not considered a "correct list" due to variables, but rather an exploration based on extensive research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:51">[00:57:51]</a>.

Many notable players were considered for the book but did not make the final list, including:
*   Adam Gilchrist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:11">[00:58:11]</a>
*   Bill Lawry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:16">[00:58:16]</a>
*   David Warner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:19">[00:58:19]</a>
*   Barry Richards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:29">[00:58:29]</a>
*   Graham Gooch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:36">[00:58:36]</a>
*   Bruce Mitchell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:54">[00:58:54]</a>
*   Dudley Nourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:58">[00:58:58]</a>
*   Vijay Merchant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:04">[00:59:04]</a>
*   Arthur Morris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:12">[00:59:12]</a>
*   Stan McCabe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:15">[00:59:15]</a>
*   Aravinda de Silva <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:20">[00:59:20]</a>
*   Clem Hill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:44">[01:01:44]</a>

The hosts emphasize that "context is really important" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:16">[01:00:16]</a> and raw numbers alone do not tell the full story. There are "no right answers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>, and different individuals will value different aspects of a player's game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:50">[01:00:50]</a>. The process of creating the book and this competition was a "labor of love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:07">[01:00:07]</a>, aiming to gather as much information as possible on these players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:12">[01:02:12]</a>.

The book, "The Art of Batting," is available on May 8th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>. Ross Taylor's example, who averaged over 50 despite vision issues, highlights how top-level batting talent can "basically see in the dark" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:32">[01:03:32]</a>.

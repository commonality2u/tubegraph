Modern cricket has seen significant [[evolution_of_cricket_from_traditional_to_modern_techniques|evolution]] in bowling techniques and strategies, with players adapting to new formats and demands. This includes the development of unusual bowling styles, changes in bowler roles, and the impact of the [[impact_of_t20_cricket_on_modern_bowling|T20 cricket]] era.

## Virat Kohli: The "Platypus" of Bowling

Virat Kohli possesses a bowling style described as "weird" and akin to a "platypus" due to its unconventional nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. His technique involves bowling leg cutters, where his fingers roll over the top of the ball, similar to a leg-spinner but with the ball coming out the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.

Key characteristics of Kohli's bowling:
*   **Pace and Revolution** He bowls at a spinner's pace, or a fast spinner's pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>, putting revolutions on the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.
*   **Drift and Angle** His deliveries often drift in and angle down the leg side, with the potential to straighten, especially on dusty surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>.
*   **Unusual Action** Kohli's arm comes over the top of his head, high up by his ear, in a whippy, almost windmill-like action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>. He sometimes appears to be bowling off the wrong foot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>.
*   **Unpredictability** Batters typically chunk memories of facing different types of deliveries to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. However, Kohli's unique peculiarities make it difficult for batters to prepare for him, as his slow leg cutters and unusual action are rarely encountered in professional cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>. Unlike expected, his drifting balls don't always come back in or straighten as much as a batter might anticipate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.

This unconventional style suggests Kohli could be a valuable "eighth bowler" in specific situations, offering something "weird and different" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>. Historically, leg cutters are typically bowled by fast bowlers, not slower medium-pace bowlers, especially at the professional level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. Chris Harris, a Kiwi ODI player from the 1990s, bowled similarly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.

## Roelof van der Merwe: From Attacker to Defensive Specialist

Roelof van der Merwe's career illustrates the [[evolution_of_cricket_strategies_and_player_roles|evolution of player roles]] in bowling. He once had a "very high peak" as an attacking bowler, capable of ripping the ball with a strong action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>. Over time, he has transitioned into an "old defensive bowler," mastering the art of keeping economies down without needing to generate the same pace or rip on the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>. This change is attributed to a potential decline in his physical ability to put "juice" on the ball with his fingers, wrist, elbow, or shoulder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.

Originally, when he started for South Africa, he was the attacking option alongside Johan Botha, who served as a "spoiler bowler" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>. Now, van der Merwe is better suited as a second spinner rather than a primary one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>. Despite a bowling average over 50 and an economy rate of 5.5 runs per over in the World Cup, he has been an asset to the Netherlands, holding up his end and preventing liabilities due to the effectiveness of other bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>.

## Challenges Faced by Modern Bowlers

The demands of modern cricket, particularly the [[impact of T20 cricket on modern bowling|T20 format]], have altered the roles and challenges for bowlers.

### Out-of-Position Usage
Some bowlers, like Bas de Leede and Logan van Beek for the Netherlands, have been "used out of position" in the 2023 World Cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.
*   **Bas de Leede** is ideally a fifth bowler, suited for "softer overs" in the middle of an innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>. However, due to team needs, he has been forced to bowl "everywhere," including in death overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>. Despite high economies, he has taken a "bucket of wickets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>.
*   **Logan van Beek** is best suited as a first-change bowler, coming on around the sixth or seventh over, and serving as a secondary death bowler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>. He has also had to step up beyond his optimal role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>.
This scenario, though leading to higher economies, reflects bowlers taking on necessary responsibilities for their team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:45">[00:27:45]</a>.

### Decline of "Dibl Dobblers"
The era of "dibl dobl" bowlers (slower, medium-pace bowlers who rely on variation) has largely faded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>.
*   **Reasons for decline**:
    *   Teams realized that 5th or 6th bowling options often had poor numbers and didn't provide a significant advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:43">[00:43:43]</a>.
    *   Modern bowlers are significantly quicker, making it difficult for slower bowlers (e.g., 65-75 mph) to compete effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>.
    *   Changes in ball hardness and the advent of [[impact of T20 cricket on modern bowling|T20 cricket]] have made it harder to bowl slowly and prevent scoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:48">[00:44:48]</a>.
    *   Batters are now willing to take risks against non-specialist bowlers, unlike in previous eras where they might "let the other guy bowl" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:38">[00:45:38]</a>.
*   **Modern equivalent**: Contemporary "dibl dobblers" like Marcus Stoinis bowl around 80 mph and must constantly vary their deliveries (e.g., bouncers, different balls almost every delivery) to stay ahead of batters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:41">[00:45:41]</a>.

## Fielding Challenges for Bowlers

Fielding is a skill that must be developed, and some bowlers, particularly those who are "natural bowlers" and jump through cricket stages quickly, may lack comprehensive fielding experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:13">[00:52:13]</a>.

*   **Lack of varied exposure**: Bowlers often spend time in deep fielding positions (e.g., deep fine leg, mid-on, mid-off) and may not get enough exposure to catching positions like slips or covers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:49">[00:56:49]</a>. This limits their development across different fielding scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.
*   **Athleticism differences**: There's an argument that bowlers' athleticism differs from batters', affecting their ability to read the ball in the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:03">[00:54:03]</a>. This might explain why specialist bowlers rarely field in the slips, a position typically occupied by all-rounders or batters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:19">[00:54:19]</a>. While fielding can be improved, natural talent plays a significant role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:49">[00:54:49]</a>.

Overall, the [[evolution of cricket strategies and player roles|evolution of cricket strategies]] has forced bowlers to adapt their techniques, roles, and even their physical attributes to remain competitive in the modern game.

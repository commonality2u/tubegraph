New Zealand progressed to the semi-finals of the tournament, though they were defeated by India in their semi-final match in Dubai by 44 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. This meant India topped Group A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.

## Overall Performance

Despite their loss to India, New Zealand is considered a tough team to play against <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:14:00">[34:14:00]</a>. They have historically been a "bogey team" for nations like South Africa and India, often knocking them out of tournaments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:57:00">[52:57:00]</a>.

## Semi-Final Match vs. India

In their semi-final match against India in Dubai, New Zealand won the toss and chose to field first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:31:00">[28:31:00]</a>. This decision was surprising given there was no dew around in Dubai and the wicket typically gets more difficult as the innings progresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:23:00">[28:23:23]</a>. While they managed to put India in a difficult position early, at 30 for 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:34:00">[28:34:00]</a>, they couldn't maintain the pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:13:00">[30:13:00]</a>.

### Bowling Strategy

New Zealand's main strength is taking early wickets with seam bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:57:00">[28:57:00]</a>. Their bowling attack is described as shaping up well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:09:00">[33:09:00]</a> and potentially the best in-form new ball attack among the top four teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:55:00">[41:55:00]</a>.

*   **Pace Attack:**
    *   **Matt Henry:** A standout performer, Matt Henry claimed 5 for 42 against India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:24:00">[28:24:00]</a> and 3 wickets against Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:29:00">[30:29:00]</a>. He is considered criminally underrated and has been performing well for two to three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:34:00">[30:34:00]</a>. He is very potent with the new ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:12:00">[33:12:00]</a>.
    *   **Kyle Jamieson:** He has returned from injury, which strengthens the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:08:00">[31:08:00]</a>. New Zealand has opted to open the bowling with Jamieson alongside Matt Henry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:56:00">[30:56:00]</a>. Despite a proper batter, he was taken to town by Hardik Pandya in the match against India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:25:00">[32:25:00]</a>.
    *   **Lockie Ferguson (Willow Rock):** He comes on as the first change bowler, which is seen as a better option for the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:58:00">[30:58:00]</a>.
*   **Spin Attack:**
    *   **Michael Bracewell:** He took 4 for 26 against [[bangladesh_bowling_performance_and_strategies | Bangladesh]], which were the best figures for a New Zealand spinner in the Champions Trophy ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:42:00">[30:42:00]</a>. Bracewell also bats, adding luxury to the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:19:00">[33:19:00]</a>.
    *   **Mitchell Santner:** Santner picked up 3 wickets against Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:23:00">[33:23:00]</a> and also contributes with the bat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:19:00">[33:19:00]</a>.
    *   The spinners are not considered world-class, but their batting capabilities provide flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:17:00">[33:17:00]</a>.

### Fielding Performance

New Zealand is highlighted as the best fielding team in the tournament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:44:00">[41:44:00]</a>.
*   **Glenn Phillips:** He has taken two outrageous, one-handed catches at point and backward point, which are considered among the top catches of the tournament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:41:00">[33:41:00]</a>.
*   **Kane Williamson:** He also took two one-handed catches against India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:57:00">[33:57:00]</a>.
Their discipline in the field means they hold onto their catches and do not concede many extras, providing an edge over other teams like Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:31:00">[41:31:00]</a>.

### Challenges

While New Zealand's bowling attack has its strengths, the commentary suggests that other top teams like South Africa, Australia, and [[india_vs_new_zealand_odi_analysis | India]] score much quicker, posing a challenge for New Zealand to keep up with the bat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:46:00">[40:46:00]</a>. Their strategy relies on [[new_zealands_batting_performance_and_strategy | Rachin Ravindra]] and [[new_zealands_batting_performance_and_strategy | Glenn Phillips]] scoring runs consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:06:00">[40:06:00]</a>.

The use of saliva to shine the cricket ball has been a long-standing practice in cricket, but it faced a temporary ban and has now been reintroduced, prompting discussions about its effectiveness and hygiene in the modern game.

## The COVID-19 Ban and its Impact

Initially, during the COVID-19 pandemic, saliva was banned as a hygiene measure, with only sweat allowed to shine the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Despite the ban, cricket functioned seemingly without a significant difference in play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. Bowlers, in retrospect, reportedly "didn't realize how little saliva did until it was taken away" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>. The "new ball white ball and new ball red ball absolutley dominating with no saliva" was observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

## Reintroduction and Rationale

Despite hygiene concerns and the perceived lack of impact from its absence, saliva has been brought back into use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. The rationale behind its reintroduction is suggested to be related to the waning severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and the desire of players to have it back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>. Muhammad Shami, a more traditional bowler, was noted as a loud voice advocating for its return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.

## Effectiveness of Saliva

The effectiveness of saliva in ball maintenance varies depending on the type of ball and bowling technique:

### Red Ball vs. White Ball
With a red ball, which has a leather case, saliva can be used to smooth over nicks and maintain the ball's sheen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>. This can be argued to benefit swing bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

However, white balls are painted and do not react the same way to saliva, limiting its utility in maintaining sheen or aiding swing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. For white balls, there is little to no impact on reverse swing, as the ball cannot be "loaded" in the same manner as a red ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.

### Impact on Swing and Reverse Swing
Historically, saliva was used to load one side of the ball to achieve reverse swing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>. However, this practice of "loading" the ball has largely faded out since the mid-2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>.

It is questioned whether saliva significantly impacts new ball swing in white ball cricket. While it might lead to an "extra three or four balls of swing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>, observation and data from the past four years suggest minimal difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. The primary factors affecting swing appear to be the ball hitting the pitch or bat, causing damage and loss of lacquer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>.

### [[evolution_of_bowling_techniques_and_challenges_in_modern_cricket | Evolution of Bowling Techniques]]
A significant factor diminishing the impact of saliva is the shift in bowling techniques. There are now almost no traditional swing bowlers left in cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>. Instead, there's a prevalence of [[seam_movement_and_wobble_ball_technique_in_cricket | wobble ball bowlers]] who aim to make the ball move off the pitch rather than through the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. The [[impact_of_wobble_ball_in_modern_cricket | wobble ball]] technique inherently damages both sides of the ball, making it harder to maintain one shiny side for swing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. Many bowlers, like Sam Curran, have switched mid-career to bowl the [[seam_movement_and_wobble_ball_technique_in_cricket | wobble ball]] most of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>, and it is believed that most players cannot easily switch between [[seam_movement_and_wobble_ball_technique_in_cricket | wobble ball]] and swing techniques within a game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>.

Some bowlers, especially older ones, may hold a preconceived notion that saliva helps, based on its effectiveness in previous eras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. However, the game has evolved, and current bowling styles render saliva less impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.

## Hygiene Concerns
The reintroduction of saliva also brings back hygiene concerns, given that it was initially banned for being unhygienic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. This step backward from a "more hygienic future" is questioned by some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.

In conclusion, while saliva has been reinstated, its practical impact on modern white-ball cricket, particularly concerning swing and reverse swing, appears to be minimal due to the [[evolution_of_bowling_techniques_and_challenges_in_modern_cricket | evolving bowling techniques]] and the nature of white balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>.

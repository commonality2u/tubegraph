Episode 12 of the "Crick Picks Podcast" discusses the top five cheats in cricket, prompting debates among hosts Baram Kazi, Estelle Vasu, and Jared Kimber about various forms of cheating, from match-fixing to ball-tampering and questionable on-field actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Notable Cheats and Scandals

### Salman Butt
Former Pakistan Test Captain Salman Butt is cited as a significant cheat in cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Despite leading his nation to victories, including against Australia at Headingley and an Oval Test win in England, he engaged in [[famous_matchfixing_cases_in_cricket_history | spot-fixing]] at Lord's by instructing his fast bowlers to bowl no-balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This occurred after the precedent of [[famous_matchfixing_cases_in_cricket_history | spot-fixing scandals]] hitting cricket in the 1990s and early 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Butt served jail time for his actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. He has never truly apologized, unlike Saleem Malik who apologized 20 years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. The ICC was aware of his suspicious phone activity even before the scandal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. He reportedly stated in his trial that "cricket is not that serious, it's just like wrestling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

### Cameron Bancroft and Sandpapergate
The "Sandpapergate" incident involved Cameron Bancroft being caught with sandpaper, which led to catastrophic events for [[cricket_and_player_performances | cricket]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. While ball tampering has occurred before, Bancroft's actions were blatant, using an external object to tamper with the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. It's noted that Bancroft was following orders, and many others, including coaches and administrators, were likely involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

### WG Grace
WG Grace is identified as a legitimate cheat who would change scores in scorebooks and tell umpires they couldn't give him out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. There are also stories of him being "fixing adjacent" in minor games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. He was willing to get scoreboards changed to reflect more runs for himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. His blatant cheating extended to legal actions, such as running out Sammy Jones who thought the ball was dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Grace, despite being known as a cheat, has a statue and gates named after him at Lord's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

### Hansie Cronje
Hansie Cronje is noted for his willingness to sell out his country for personal gain, even for a leather jacket for his wife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. He corrupted younger players, which is highlighted as one of the worst aspects of his actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. His actions tainted the goodwill surrounding South Africa as a new team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. A Netflix documentary, "Bad Sports," covers his fixing incident, revealing his "unfortunate love of money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

### Rashid Latif
Rashid Latif was involved in a false catch claim against Bangladesh, where he picked up the ball off the floor and appealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. This incident was widely visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. He received a ban and it effectively ended his test career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. Ironically, Latif was known as one of the most honest players against [[famous_matchfixing_cases_in_cricket_history | match-fixing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.

### Marlon Samuels
Marlon Samuels has been banned twice for corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. In 2008, he was booked for leaking information to an Indian bookie, resulting in a two-year ban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. He later won two T20 World Cups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>, but was recently banned again for six years due to corruption in the T10 league in Abu Dhabi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. This second ban significantly tarnished his legacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

### Shahid Afridi
Shahid Afridi is known for two unique [[ball_tampering_incidents_in_cricket | ball-tampering incidents]]: biting the ball and scuffing up the pitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>. The ball-biting incident was particularly hilarious and made front-page news, with Afridi himself laughing about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. He also scuffed the pitch against England, with Kevin Pietersen catching him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. Both times, Pakistan lost the game despite his efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.

### Michael Atherton
Michael Atherton was caught in a [[ball_tampering_incidents_in_cricket | ball-tampering]] incident using dust from his pocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. Despite his current reputation as a cricket guru and broadcaster, this was considered his "darkest day" in [[cricket_and_player_performances | cricket]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. This incident highlights that many professional cricketers have engaged in some form of ball tampering throughout history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

### Shane Warne
Shane Warne was involved in both [[famous_matchfixing_cases_in_cricket_history | match-fixing]] allegations and a drug suspension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>. He was done for giving information to bookies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a> and received a one-year suspension in the middle of his career for using a masking agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>. It's noted that his reputation seems to be much better than other athletes who have committed similar offenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>.

### South Africa's Systematic Ball Tampering
The South African team, particularly players like Faf du Plessis and Vernon Philander, engaged in systematic [[ball_tampering_incidents_in_cricket | ball-tampering]] over a period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>. They were known to pass the tampering responsibility to different players to avoid detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>. Umpires were aware of this, with one even signaling tampering to commentators by holding the ball up for cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>. Faf du Plessis was fined the same amount for ball tampering (using mints and a zip) as for wearing the wrong colored shoelaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>, highlighting the disparity in penalties compared to the Australian Sandpapergate scandal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>.

### Justin Langer
Justin Langer was involved in an incident against Sri Lanka where he walked past the stumps, gently nudged a bail off after the ball was dead, and then appealed for a wicket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. He later denied intentionally knocking the bail off, but footage and Shane Warne's appeal suggest it was a planned act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>. Langer also reportedly cheated the salary cap system with Perth Scorchers in the Big Bash League <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>.

### Mohammad Asif
Mohammad Asif, a highly talented fast bowler, was involved in [[famous_matchfixing_cases_in_cricket_history | spot-fixing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>. Beyond fixing, he was banned for nandrolone (a performance-enhancing drug) and was caught with opioids at Dubai airport, leading to a ban from playing in the UAE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a>. He was known to play club cricket high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>. His career is seen as a tragedy given his immense skill, including pioneering the wobble ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.

### Lou Vincent
Lou Vincent was involved in significant [[famous_matchfixing_cases_in_cricket_history | fixing]] within the county circuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:25">[00:31:25]</a>. Although there were earlier murmurs of his involvement with bookies that were brushed aside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a>. He later came clean about his actions, showing bravery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>. His case was a highlight of the scandal that involved Chris Cairns, though Cairns was not legally proven to be involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:43">[00:31:43]</a>. His involvement was disappointing given New Zealand's reputation for the "Spirit of Cricket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a>.

### Mohammad Azharuddin
Mohammad Azharuddin was implicated in a [[famous_matchfixing_cases_in_cricket_history | fixing scandal]] from the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>. While his involvement wasn't "100% proven" and his ban was complicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>, it ruined his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>. Azharuddin had a reputation as a good guy and captain during the Sachin Tendulkar era before his lifetime ban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a>.

### West Indies Team (Dean Jones Run Out)
In the early 1990s (possibly 1991), during a Test match in Antigua, Dean Jones was bowled by a no-ball, but believed he was out due to crowd noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>. As he walked off, Allan Border informed him it was a no-ball, and as Jones ran back, the West Indies players ran him out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:46">[00:36:46]</a>. The umpires mistakenly allowed the dismissal, not knowing the law that protects a batter who leaves the crease believing they are dismissed incorrectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:57">[00:36:57]</a>. The West Indies team knowingly allowed the incorrect decision to stand, refusing to correct the umpire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:24">[00:37:24]</a>.

## Other Mentions and Concepts

*   **ICC's India/Pakistan Group Draws:** The ICC is accused of "gerrymandering" tournament groups to ensure India and Pakistan always meet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:11">[00:33:11]</a>. This is seen as a form of cheating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:37">[00:33:37]</a>.
*   **Wicketkeepers:** Wicketkeepers are broadly labeled as "devious bastards" due to a history of false catch claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. Specific examples include Brad Haddin knocking bails off with his hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a> and Quinton de Kock pretending to miss the ball to run out a batter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:32">[00:39:32]</a>.
*   **General Ball Tampering:** It's suggested that most professional cricketers have tampered with the ball in some way, often subtly, long before the reverse swing era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>. Examples include England in the 2005 Ashes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a> and New Zealand's "bottle top" incident involving Chris Pringle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:55">[00:38:55]</a>.
*   **Pitch Tampering:** Besides Shahid Afridi, Matthew Wade was suspended for dancing on the pitch in an obvious attempt to rough it up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>. A famous club cricket story involves Dean Jones's father placing a block of ice on the pitch to create a wet spot for bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.
*   **Other Fixers:** Additional [[famous_matchfixing_cases_in_cricket_history | fixers]] mentioned include Danish Kaneria (county cricket) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:56">[00:30:56]</a>, Nasir Jamshed (mastermind of local fixing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>, Sreesanth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:35">[00:38:35]</a>, Mohammad Amir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:42">[00:38:42]</a>, and Sharjeel Khan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:45">[00:38:45]</a>. Wasim Akram is also mentioned in the Qayyum Report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>.
*   **Non-Cheating Incidents:**
    *   Trevor Chappell's underarm delivery was not cheating at the time as laws hadn't been updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>.
    *   Players not walking after nicking the ball is considered "good cricket," not cheating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:28">[00:41:28]</a>.
*   **Historical Anecdotes:**
    *   Alan Knott's bails were taken away by Indian players when he tried to use one to mark his guard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:55">[00:40:55]</a>.
    *   Jason Gillespie's run-up involved waving his arms like a bird, which was considered against the laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>.
    *   In a 1930s women's club game in Melbourne, chewing gum was used to keep bales on the stumps in windy conditions, leading to confusion when batters were bowled but the bails didn't fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> The discussion highlights that [[cricket_and_player_performances | cricket]] is a sport "made for cheating" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>, and that incidents of cheating, while often controversial, can sometimes be seen as "fun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:30">[00:38:30]</a>. There is a lack of prominent cheating incidents mentioned in women's cricket, potentially due to less televised coverage in earlier eras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>.

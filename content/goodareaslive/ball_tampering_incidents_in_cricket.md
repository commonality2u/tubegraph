Ball tampering refers to the illegal alteration of a cricket ball by a player or team to gain an unfair advantage, typically to make it swing or seam more. Throughout the history of cricket, several high-profile incidents have brought this controversial practice into the spotlight.

## Prominent Ball Tampering Cases

### Cameron Bancroft and "Sandpaper-gate"
The "Sandpaper-gate" scandal involving [[Crickets biggest cheats and scandals | Cameron Bancroft]] in 2018 during a Test match against South Africa was a catastrophic event for cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Bancroft was caught on camera using sandpaper to alter the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This act was seen as particularly blatant because it involved bringing an external object onto the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. While Bancroft was technically following orders, many believe that Cricket Australia, including coaches and administrators, should have faced accountability as it was a systemic issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

### Shahid Afridi's Ball Biting Incident
Shahid Afridi was involved in a peculiar ball tampering incident where he was seen biting the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. This act was widely publicized and described as hilarious due to its bizarre nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. Afridi had also previously scuffed up the pitch during a Test match against England, showing a consistent desire to win by "all means necessary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. Despite his efforts, Pakistan lost the game in which he bit the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.

### Michael Atherton's "Dust" Incident
Former England captain Mike Atherton was caught in a ball tampering controversy when he was found with "dust" in his pocket, which he used to alter the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. This incident was surprising to many, given Atherton's reputation as a respected figure in cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. He later referred to it as his "Darkest Day in cricket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.

### Systematic Tampering by South Africa
Over a period, several South African players were systematically involved in ball tampering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. This included [[Controversial decisions and news in international cricket | Faf du Plessis]] who was caught twice (once for using a mint, another time for rubbing the ball on his trouser zip) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>, and Vernon Philander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a>. Umpires were aware of this ongoing practice, and the team would pass the ball to different players after one was caught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>. Notably, Faf du Plessis received a similar fine for ball tampering as for wearing the wrong colored shoelaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>, highlighting the differing penalties compared to other nations like Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>.

### Muhammad Asif and the Wobble Ball
While primarily known for his involvement in spot-fixing, Muhammad Asif is also credited with popularizing the [[Impact of wobble ball in modern cricket | wobble ball]] delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>. This technique involves moving the ball in the fingers to achieve unique movement, showcasing his immense skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>.

## Broader Context of Ball Tampering
Many experts believe that most professional cricketers have engaged in some form of ball tampering, whether through subtle means like picking at the seam or applying oils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>. It has been a historical part of the game even before the concept of reverse swing became prominent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>.

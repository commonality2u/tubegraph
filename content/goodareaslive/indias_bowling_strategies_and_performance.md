India demonstrated strong bowling performance in a recent match against Pakistan, contributing significantly to a comprehensive victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Despite some initial struggles for individual bowlers, the overall strategy and depth of the Indian bowling attack proved overwhelming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Overall Bowling Philosophy

Teams in modern cricket, including India, are increasingly picking bowlers who are pushed to "chase wickets" even if it means their economy rates might "balloon a little bit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This aggressive approach is a response to the presence of many quality batters who can score at around a run a ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. The belief is that bowlers can no longer afford to be purely defensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

## Bowler Performances

### Mohammed Siraj
Siraj had a challenging start, conceding 12 runs in his first over and appearing "all over the place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. However, he adjusted by pulling back his length, conceding only 15 runs in his next four overs and taking the wicket of Abdullah Shafique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. The team's strategy for Siraj is to bowl very full and "chase wickets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. This approach can lead to more loose balls, but Siraj is effective at hitting the stumps and securing LBWs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

### Jasprit Bumrah's Off-Cutter
Jasprit Bumrah's off-cutter delivery is described as "ridiculously high quality" and akin to an off-spinner bowling at 80 mph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. This delivery, which pitched significantly outside off stump and suddenly came in, caused great difficulty for batters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Even if anticipated, the ball is difficult to play, often beating the bat on the inside or ending up on the pads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. The key impact of Bumrah's off-cutter is its ability to hit the top of off-stump, a result not typically expected from a seam bowler on such a pitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. This delivery is considered Bumrah's third great off-cutter, following notable ones against Shaun Marsh and Ollie Robinson, each impressive for different reasons (dip, angles, rip/placement) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

### Kuldeep Yadav's Dominance
Kuldeep Yadav boasts an "extraordinary low average" against Pakistan, having taken 12 wickets in six games against them, primarily in Asia Cup and World Cup matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. He has developed significantly, becoming "better now than when no one could play him the first time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. He demonstrated his skill by beating a strong player of spin, Saud Shakeel, with flight and delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. Kuldeep's evolution as a left-arm wrist-spinner is particularly notable, as many left-arm wrist-spinners tend to have "flawed actions" and "don't always last as long" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

## Bowling Strengths and Strategy

### Attacking the Stumps
[[Indias bowling strategy and selection in ODIs | Indian bowlers]] frequently attack the stumps, leading to a higher percentage of bowled and LBW dismissals compared to the general average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. This is observed across various bowlers, including Bumrah, Kuldeep, Jadeja, and even Hardik Pandya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. This strategy may be part of an "Asian style of things," contrasting with bowlers from Australia, South Africa, England, or New Zealand who might bowl wider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. The pitch in the recent match, which showed inconsistent low bounce, might have inadvertently assisted this specific bowling attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

### Depth of All-Rounders
India's bowling attack is significantly bolstered by its all-rounders, particularly [[Indias batting and bowling strategies | Hardik Pandya]] and [[Indias batting and bowling strategies | Ravindra Jadeja]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. They combined to bowl 15.5 overs and took 4 for 72 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. Hardik Pandya is considered to be a stronger sixth bowler than any other team in the World Cup has, and Ravindra Jadeja is arguably stronger than most teams' fifth bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. The combination of these two is a unique strength that is often underrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. This depth makes it "very hard to find a floor" with the Indian team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

### Selection of Shardul Thakur vs. Mohammed Shami/Ravichandran Ashwin
The selection of Shardul Thakur, who bowled very few overs in the match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>, over Mohammed Shami or Ravichandran Ashwin is a point of discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. While Ashwin might have made more impact on a flat wicket like this one, the team prefers Shardul's batting at number eight in ODIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. This preference stems from a desire for batting depth, aiming to empower top-order batters by giving them the confidence of a long batting lineup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>. Mohammed Shami is expected to play on wickets that favor seam movement or against strong batting lineups like South Africa or England, where taking many wickets is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>.

The start of the Indian Test Summer is often marked by the Indian top order being "completely bailed out by guys in the lower part again and again and again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This trend continued on Day 1 of the [[india_vs_bangladesh_test_match_summary | India vs Bangladesh 1st Test]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## India's Batting Performance

The Indian top order struggled against Bangladesh's bowling attack early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. However, the lower order stepped up significantly.

### Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja's Partnership
A significant partnership between Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja bailed out the Indian innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Their 109-run stand was notable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>.
*   **Ravichandran Ashwin**: Displayed excellent batting, reminding everyone he is a "greater batter than Kuldeep Yadav" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:48">[01:50:48]</a>. Ashwin knows his game well, primarily hitting on the leg side but also occasionally finding edges off pace bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:26">[04:44:26]</a>. He showed good attacking intent with a 45% attack rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:36">[13:26:36]</a>. He is considered a legend of Indian cricket with over 500 Test wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:35:10">[36:35:10]</a>.
*   **Ravindra Jadeja**: Is praised for his ability to "simply not getting out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:05">[02:07:05]</a>. His batting style involves targeting the leg side, using a bottom-hand technique to drag the ball across <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:04">[05:16:04]</a>. Jadeja's control factor was 90%, showing few mistakes unless the pitch was treacherous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:03">[12:11:03]</a>. He waits for "ranked balls" to put them away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:37:34">[12:37:34]</a>.

### Other Batters
*   **KL Rahul**: Soaked up approximately 50 balls of pressure at a crucial time when India was struggling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:09">[11:41:09]</a>. He achieved the best control percentage among the batters, though he is unlikely to receive much credit due to his low score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:51">[11:29:51]</a>. His dismissal to spin is a recurring issue, as he makes fewer runs in India compared to away matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:54">[12:00:54]</a>.
*   **Rishabh Pant**: Scored 39 runs and helped "pause" Bangladesh's momentum, forcing them to rethink their strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:26">[14:06:26]</a>. Pant is known for his attacking style, particularly square of the wicket, with the ability to play shots from third man to cover point from similar deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:35:36">[13:35:36]</a>. His dismissal was due to a late decision to attack a short ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:48:07">[15:48:07]</a>.
*   **Shreyas Iyer**: Also had a good control percentage, indicating a solid batting performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:07">[12:45:07]</a>.
*   **Shubman Gill**: His dismissal was described as "a bit more ass" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:40">[11:21:40]</a>. Gill is noted for the wide variety of his scoring options across the ground, making it difficult for bowlers to contain him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:39:19">[16:39:19]</a>.

## Bangladesh's Bowling Performance

Bangladesh's bowlers started well, but fatigue and a softening ball led to a loss of control later in the day.

### Early Impact
*   **Hassan Mahmud**: "Wobbling the ball all over the place" early on and was considered a potential "seam bowling Ajaz Patel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:04">[00:57:04]</a>. He bowled very well, showing unpredictability with significant seam movement both ways, though more often away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:51:30">[20:51:30]</a>.
*   **Nahid Rana**: Also contributed to the seam attack, hitting Ashwin on the badge at times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:54">[01:19:54]</a>.
*   **Overall**: Bangladesh showed they have "more than one seam available to them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:28">[01:17:28]</a>. The pitch was described as a "fantastic Cricket Wicket" with good energy off the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:02">[10:54:02]</a>.

### Match Dynamics
Bangladesh's attack rate in the first session was 3.8 runs an over, which was considered decent, even in the "Bazball era" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:10">[07:35:10]</a>. However, their run rate escalated to 5 runs an over in the final session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:43">[08:08:43]</a>. This was partly due to Bangladesh getting behind on their over rate, leading to long sessions without breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>.

A key factor was the softening of the ball, which made batting easier after the sixth wicket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:39">[09:07:39]</a>. When the ball lost its hardness, lateral movement and spin happened "slow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:20">[09:22:20]</a>.

Bangladesh seamers found most success on a slightly back-of-a-length, or "good length" delivery (7-8 meters), averaging just under 20 runs per wicket on this length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:36:19">[26:36:19]</a>. Other lengths were less successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:38:59">[27:38:59]</a>.

The Bangladesh spinners bowled mostly between 81 and 90 miles per hour, which is considered a mid-pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:22:15">[28:22:15]</a>. However, a small percentage (1.7%) of their deliveries were over 90 mph, reflecting a modern trend in spin bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:37:37">[28:37:37]</a>. In India, faster spin bowling (90+ mph) has proven to be the most effective, averaging under 20 runs per wicket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:50:33">[29:50:33]</a>. It was suggested that Bangladesh might need to bowl quicker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:58:39">[31:58:39]</a>.

Bangladesh bowlers often overpitched or underpitched, making it easier for Indian batters to play through the line of the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:16:04">[32:16:04]</a>.

### Pitch Conditions
The pitch on Day 1 was described as a "fairly good batting wicket with a little bit of assistance to seam bowling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:18:49">[42:18:49]</a>. It was not considered an "Australian Wicket" as it lacked the vertical bounce seen in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:56:49">[42:56:49]</a>.

## Player Milestones and Significance
Having two all-rounders like Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja, who can both achieve 3,000 runs and 300 wickets in Test cricket, is considered an "insane" and "incredibly special thing" for India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:01:21">[51:01:21]</a>. Ravichandran Ashwin is widely considered a legend of Indian cricket, having taken over 500 Test wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:35:10">[36:35:10]</a>.

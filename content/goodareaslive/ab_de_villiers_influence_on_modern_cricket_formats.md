*   **Test Matches**: He could perform a "blockathon" to save a match or aggressively "bat the opposition out of the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>. In 114 Test matches, he scored 8,765 runs with 22 centuries, averaging 50.66 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>.

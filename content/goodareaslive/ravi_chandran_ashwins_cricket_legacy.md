Ravi Ashwin, a "bonafide Test Legend" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>, made a shocking mid-series retirement from international cricket during the Gaba Test in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The decision was described as a "grown-up decision" by both Ashwin and Indian cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. It appeared he was informed that he wasn't in India's plans for the upcoming SCG match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, and while some would have played him there, spin bowlers had averaged 52 at the SCG in the previous four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

It's believed that Ashwin was told he would be primarily used in home games and as a backup spinner, and that he wouldn't play much in England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Given he would be around 39 by the next home Tests, he likely decided not to "overstay his welcome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Rohit Sharma had heard rumors of Ashwin's retirement intentions and had spoken to him about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. Despite the "dicey" nature of a mid-series retirement, fans respected his decision, even though they would have liked to see him get a send-off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

## [[Performance and Role of Ravi Ashwin in Test Cricket | Playing Style and Intelligence]]

Ashwin is recognized as a "proper nerd" whose intelligence and wit set him apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. His "mild changes in his angle," use of the carrom ball, and variations in pace made him an "intelligent cricketer" and one of the "best cricketing brains" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. He was considered a better Test cricketer than Anil Kumble due to his batting contributions and his tactical input on the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Ashwin is seen as an all-rounder, but with a different kind of all-round ability, contributing significantly with his thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. He was capable of adapting, showing improvements in his game, and was brilliant in the West Indies and South Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. England was perhaps the only place where he consistently struggled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

## [[Comparison of cricket legends | Comparisons with Other Cricket Prodigies]]

There is extensive debate regarding [[Comparison of cricket legends | Ashwin's place among the greatest spinners of all time]]. Some argue he is the greatest Indian spinner ever, and potentially the best after Shane Warne and Muttiah Muralitharan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. While there isn't "much between him purely as a spinner" and Anil Kumble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>, the discussion often boils down to whether Kumble bowled on flat decks while Ashwin bowled on more helpful surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. However, it's suggested that Ashwin would have been effective on flat decks and Kumble on spinning decks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

Ashwin's retirement differs significantly from Graeme Swann's, which happened because Swann's arm "completely gave way" and England was desperate to have him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. With Ashwin, India had other spinners available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

## Off-Field Impact and Future

Ashwin has been praised as a "thorough gentleman" and a "great Ambassador for Indian cricket and Cricket overall" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. His deep understanding of the sport suggests a solid career in media, where he could "revolutionize Cricket media" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. He's known for making complex topics mainstream, like the 'mankad' dismissal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. He's a "forward thinker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a> who has been frustrated by the state of cricket media and has the communication skills and stature to change conversations around the sport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Ashwin has never been shy of being a cricket fan or seeking new information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. His "cricket nut" passion will never end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. He possessed the "strength of character" to make unpopular decisions, such as the 'retired out' strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>, and was not afraid to say when he was "done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

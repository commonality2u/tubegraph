## Current Form and Performance

[[Rohit Sharmas IPL performance versus expectations | Rohit Sharma]] has experienced inconsistent form, described as "blowing hot and cold," predominantly "cold," during his time with [[Rohit Sharmas performance for Mumbai Indians | Mumbai Indians]] in IPL cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This contrasts with his approach for India in T20s and ODIs, where he embraced an aggressive, "big swinging" style, transforming India's white-ball cricket from an anchor-based strategy to a dominant one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

However, upon returning to [[Rohit Sharmas performance for Mumbai Indians | Mumbai]], he tends to revert to a more cautious approach, despite the team's strong batting lineup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. When [[Rohit Sharmas impact and batting strategy | Rohit Sharma]] accelerates, opponents become apprehensive, knowing he can drastically alter a game with a rapid hundred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### Batting Strategy and IPL Performance
[[Rohit Sharmas IPL performance versus expectations | Rohit Sharma]] has never achieved a strike rate over 150 in an IPL season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Given his aggressive batting for India, it's believed he could easily strike at 160-165 in the IPL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. His batting style appears to be significantly different for [[Rohit Sharmas performance for Mumbai Indians | Mumbai]] compared to India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

The "impact sub" rule in IPL has not visibly influenced his playing style, possibly because he prefers the higher-risk, 11-player format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Interestingly, [[Rohit Sharmas batting strategy and position in IPL | his best IPL batting numbers are recorded at number four]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, though he is currently expected to [[Rohit Sharmas performance as an opener | open]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

## Post-Captaincy Transition and Impact
There is speculation that [[Rohit Sharmas impact and batting strategy | Rohit Sharma]] may be struggling to find his role within the [[Rohit Sharmas performance for Mumbai Indians | Mumbai Indians]] team structure after stepping down from captaincy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This existential challenge can be significant for senior players, similar to what [[Virat Kohli]] experienced after losing captaincy, which required "soul-searching" and affected his form as he sought to redefine his position within the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Future in International Cricket
It is suggested that [[Rohit Sharmas Test Retirement and its Impact on Indian Cricket | Rohit Sharma]] "called it wrong" by retiring from T20 cricket after the World Cup win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. He is encouraged to continue playing ODI and T20 cricket, and potentially [[Rohit Sharmas Test Career and Performance Analysis | Test cricket]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

### Fitness Concerns
A key consideration for his continued international career is his fitness; [[Rohit Sharmas fitness and future in international cricket | Rohit Sharma]] is "not the keenest guy on fitness" currently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. To regain his reflexes, he would need to dedicate 3 to 6 months to intensive fitness training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. The motivation for such an effort at his age remains uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. However, if he commits to this, it's believed he could find a "second wind" in [[Rohit Sharmas Test Career and Performance Analysis | Test cricket]] and play for another two or three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

Ultimately, [[Future Prospects for Indian Cricket After Rohit Sharmas Retirement | his future depends on his personal decisions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. He is acknowledged as an "incredible captain," and there is hope for him to regain strong form, especially for the sake of [[Rohit Sharmas performance for Mumbai Indians | Mumbai]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

From: [[goodareaslive]] <br/> 

The Indian Test Summer is often characterized by the top order being bailed out by lower-order batsmen, with [[performance_of_r_ashwin_and_r_jadeja | Ravichandran Ashwin]] and [[performance_of_r_ashwin_and_r_jadeja | Ravindra Jadeja]] frequently serving as key performers in such situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Their contributions are vital, especially when the main batsmen struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Role and Importance in the Batting Lineup
[[performance_and_role_of_ravi_ashwin_in_test_cricket | R Ashwin]] has demonstrated his prowess as a batter, asserting himself as a more accomplished batsman than other Indian bowlers like Kuldeep Yadav or Shardul Thakur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Meanwhile, [[ravi_jadejas_batting_performance_and_strategy | Ravindra Jadeja]] is renowned for his exceptional ability to stay at the crease and avoid getting out, a skill described as the "least sexy and most important" in batting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. He is metaphorically referred to as "the condom of the Indian batting lineup" for his defensive solidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

Both players become particularly crucial once the ball softens in Test cricket, as batting becomes significantly easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

## Individual Batting Styles

### [[performance_and_role_of_ravi_ashwin_in_test_cricket | R Ashwin's]] Approach
[[performance_and_role_of_ravi_ashwin_in_test_cricket | Ashwin's]] batting style is characterized by its limited yet effective nature; he understands his game and adheres to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. He predominantly scores on the leg side, with occasional edges off pace bowlers or spinners. This disciplined approach is highly advantageous for a batsman who may not consistently average 35 in Test cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. He demonstrated a good attacking approach, indicating his willingness to go after the bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.

### [[ravi_jadejas_batting_performance_and_strategy | Ravindra Jadeja's]] Approach
[[ravi_jadejas_batting_performance_and_strategy | Jadeja]] primarily targets the leg side for scoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. On the offside, he has a specific shot where he opens his bat face to cut the ball. His leg-side play involves a bottom-hand dominant style to drag the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. [[ravi_jadejas_batting_performance_and_strategy | Jadeja]] exhibits a high control factor in his batting, rarely making mistakes unless the pitch is exceptionally challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. He is known for dead-batting many deliveries and waiting for "ranked balls" to score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

## Partnership Effectiveness
[[performance_of_r_ashwin_and_r_jadeja | Ashwin and Jadeja]] enjoy batting together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Despite feeling like they have batted together more, their partnership for significant scores has only occurred three times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Their most recent notable partnership scored 109 runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

A key moment in their partnership against Bangladesh involved [[ravi_jadejas_batting_performance_and_strategy | Jadeja]] hitting a boundary, followed by [[performance_and_role_of_ravi_ashwin_in_test_cricket | Ashwin]] hitting a six, demonstrating their ability to shift from handling threats to applying pressure on the bowlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Their scoring rates increased, partly due to bowler fatigue but also because they actively sought scoring options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. Both players showed "incredible control percentages" during their innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

The presence of two all-rounders like [[performance_and_role_of_ravi_ashwin_in_test_cricket | Ashwin]] and [[ravi_jadejas_batting_performance_and_strategy | Jadeja]], particularly with their batting capabilities, is considered "incredibly special" for the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:26">[00:52:26]</a>. They provide the team with depth and flexibility, enabling them to navigate challenging situations.

### Comparing Spin Speeds
When comparing spin bowling speeds, Bangladesh spinners bowled predominantly between 81-90 miles per hour. This is generally a mid-pace, contrasting with slower Sri Lankan spinners (71-80 mph) observed in another match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:19">[00:28:19]</a>. In India, quicker spin bowling (81-90 mph) has been more successful historically, particularly for leg-spinners like Anil Kumble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>. This suggests that a more "direct" approach with spin, rather than slower deliveries, is often preferred on Indian pitches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>.

### Strategic Implications
The partnership's success also highlights a potential flaw in Bangladesh's bowling strategy, specifically their over-pitching and under-pitching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>. Delivering the ball between four to five meters from the batsman forces Indian players to use their feet, which is ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a>. However, "step and fetch" deliveries, which allow batsmen to take a big stride and play through the line without extensive footwork, are considered the worst type of delivery against skilled players like [[performance_of_r_ashwin_and_r_jadeja | Ashwin]] and [[performance_of_r_ashwin_and_r_jadeja | Jadeja]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a>.

## [[ravi_chandran_ashwins_cricket_legacy | Ashwin's]] Test Legacy
[[ravi_chandran_ashwins_cricket_legacy | R Ashwin]] is already considered a legend in Indian cricket, particularly for his immense wicket tally, having taken over 500 Test wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:35">[00:36:35]</a>. His batting contributions, like the crucial innings, further solidify his place among the greats. While his home record is exceptional, he is certainly on the "Mount Rushmore" of Indian cricket legends, alongside figures like Gavaskar, Tendulkar, Kohli, Dravid, and Kumble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[00:37:08]</a>. The future position of both [[performance_of_r_ashwin_and_r_jadeja | Ashwin]] and [[performance_of_r_ashwin_and_r_jadeja | Jadeja]] on this list will depend on their performance in the coming years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>.

Against Bangladesh, [[performance_and_role_of_ravi_ashwin_in_test_cricket | Ashwin]] faced short balls and pace, which could be seen as an audition for the upcoming series in Australia, where similar conditions are expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:33">[00:49:33]</a>. His ability to handle pace and bounce could influence selection, especially given the tail-end batting vulnerability if a wicket falls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:08">[00:50:08]</a>.

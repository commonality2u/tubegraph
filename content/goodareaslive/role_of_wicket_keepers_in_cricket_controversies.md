Wicketkeepers, positioned behind the stumps, are unique observers of the game, often privy to close calls and subtle movements. This proximity, however, has at times placed them at the heart of some of cricket's most notable controversies, particularly concerning catches and dislodged bails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

## Infamous Incidents

### Rashid Latif's Questionable Catch

Pakistani wicketkeeper Rashid Latif was involved in a widely criticized incident against Bangladesh where he claimed a catch when the ball appeared to have already touched the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. The visual evidence made his action seem "insane" as it was obvious to onlookers that the ball was on the floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. This led to a ban for Latif, effectively ending his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. Ironically, Latif was otherwise known for his honesty, particularly in relation to [[impact_of_fixing_scandals_in_cricket | match-fixing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

### Brad Haddin's Bails Incident

Australian wicketkeeper Brad Haddin was involved in a controversial play where he dislodged the bails with his hands before the ball could hit the stumps, allowing New Zealand's Neil Broom to be dismissed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. Haddin later claimed he "didn't feel the stumps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>, despite his hands clearly hitting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

### General Tendencies

There's a perceived tendency for wicketkeepers to be "devious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a> and "inherently dodgy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>, often claiming catches even when doubtful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. This has led to the informal concept of a "wicketkeeper union" where they "claim everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.

## Historical Precedents

### Slug Jordan: The Cheating Wicketkeeper

A Victorian wicketkeeper named Slug Jordan was famously excluded from the Australian team because his teammates believed he consistently cheated with catches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. A figure like Ian Chappell reportedly refused to play alongside him due to this perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.

### Early 20th Century: The Chewing Gum Incident

In a women's club cricket match in Melbourne during the 1930s, strong winds led to chewing gum being used to secure the bails on the stumps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>. This unorthodox measure resulted in two instances where a batter was bowled, but the bails remained in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:15">[00:42:15]</a>, causing confusion among the umpires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:23">[00:42:23]</a>.

## Modern Day Tactics

Beyond direct involvement in dubious dismissals, some wicketkeepers have also engaged in subtle tactics:
*   Fake outs: Pretending to miss the ball and waiting for the batter to move before dislodging the bails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:18">[00:39:18]</a>. Quinton de Kock notably used this tactic recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:32">[00:39:32]</a>.

However, Mohammad Shami's spell shifted the momentum massively in [[India vs New Zealand ODI match evaluation | India]]'s favour. Despite [[India vs New Zealand ODI match evaluation | New Zealand]] picking up wickets and a run-out creating some pressure, [[India]] ultimately won easily, with Virat Kohli nearly reaching his century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Key Performances for India

### Mohammad Shami
Mohammad Shami bowled "magnificently" and was considered the reason [[India]] won the game up until the death overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. His presence as a bench option, especially if Hardik Pandya had not been injured, was described as a "ridiculous weapon" unmatched by other teams in World Cup history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

Shami holds the best strike rate in World Cup history for bowlers with a minimum of 20 wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. He has taken 36 wickets in just 12 World Cup matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. While it's noted he may have played when conditions favoured him, taking 36 wickets in 12 matches is still "absolutely fantastic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. He took an early wicket and later created a dropped chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Shami's ability to bowl quickly and move the ball in either direction, combined with added smarts, makes him a highly effective bowler in ODIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. He can both swing and seam the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

### Virat Kohli
Virat Kohli's batting statistics highlight his preference and success in run-chases:
*   **Batting Average by Innings:** His batting average "goes absolutely through the roof" in the second innings compared to the first innings, while his strike rate remains similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   **Batting Average by Match Outcome:** His average takes a "massive jump up" when [[India]] win batting second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **Batting Average by Toss Outcome:** When [[India]] win the toss and decide to field first, Kohli has a "massive average" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Even when the opposition wins the toss and makes [[India]] bat second, Kohli still averages around 60, suggesting he performs "absolutely magnificent" in chasing situations regardless of the toss outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. This indicates he thrives when he knows the exact target and formula for the innings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.
*   **Day vs. Day/Night Matches (Batting Second):** Kohli's average sees a "big jump up" when batting second in day-night matches compared to day matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. This suggests he particularly likes how the ball comes onto the bat at night, potentially due to moisture in the air allowing the ball to slide on more easily, similar to conditions in Australia where he performs well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. His strike rate also increases significantly in night chases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.

### Mohammad Siraj
Siraj's economy in the powerplay was his second-best in the tournament against Australia and New Zealand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. It was observed that he bowled more conventionally, rather than pushing for wickets, which is effective given the overall strength of the Indian bowling attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. He bowled over the wicket to Devon Conway, despite Conway's preference for balls moving away, which is a testament to Siraj's strength over the wicket to left-handers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

### Jasprit Bumrah
Bumrah is the most economical bowler in the powerplay in this World Cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>. His accuracy and consistent perfect lengths put significant pressure on New Zealand's top batters, like Conway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.

### Overall Indian Bowling Strength
[[India]] possesses five, and potentially six if Hardik Pandya returns, "strike bowlers" who are always a threat to take wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This allows them to take regular wickets just by "bowling normally," a "huge advantage" compared to teams like England who need to "manufacture wickets" with unusual fields or plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

## Key Performances for New Zealand

### Rachin Ravindra
Rachin Ravindra is the fourth-highest run-scorer in this World Cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>. As a first-drop batter, his strike rate in the first 10 overs can be slower as he gets set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>. Despite being an opener by trade, he has retrained to score effectively with fielders out and appears to score more naturally against spinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.

### Daryl Mitchell
Daryl Mitchell is a "really important" player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>. His unique batting technique against spin involves not taking big steps but using his "incredibly long legs" and "really big reach" to get to the pitch of most balls with just "a step and a half" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>. This allows him to hit the spinner's best lengths for sixes even without leaving his crease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10]">[00:24:10]</a>. Unlike players like Kieron Pollard who hit in one direction, Mitchell "manipulates the ball" across the ground with shots like reverse sweeps and paddles, making it harder to set fields against him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>. He doesn't have to take "mad" chances due to his strength and ability to "punch through the ball" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>.

### New Zealand's Bowling Improvements
[[New Zealand]]'s bowlers have shown significant improvement throughout the year, taking more and more wickets as they approached the World Cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>. Matt Henry is a "phenomenal striker" of wickets in white-ball cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>. While Trent Boult hasn't been exceptional with the new ball in this World Cup, he still applies pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>. The major change has been Mitchell Santner, who hadn't taken many wickets since the last World Cup but is now the leading wicket-taker in this tournament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>. Lockie Ferguson has also recovered from a "horrendous form slump" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>.

[[New Zealand]]'s strength lies in having four frontline bowlers who can all take wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>. This allows them to "manufacture the last 10 overs" and take risks like bowling Rachin Ravindra or Daryl Mitchell at the death to try and take early wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>. Their overall game plan involves setting aggressive fields, such as placing two fielders on the leg side for Rohit Sharma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>.

## Match Incidents

### The Fog
The match experienced a 10-minute delay due to fog coming in from the mountains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>. This was initially mistaken for smoke from pyrotechnics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>. Historically, a Test series between Zimbabwe and Pakistan was abandoned due to fog, with Zimbabwe winning their first away Test series as a result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>. Other notable match delays in cricket history include bees, bugs, a stuffed tiger causing a helicopter search, and an overcooked gravy causing a fire alarm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">[00:30:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>.

### Toss Impact
It was noted that in this World Cup, 16 out of 21 times, a team lost the game after winning the toss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:42">[00:49:42]</a>. This is sometimes a "freakish" pattern in tournaments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>.

### Peaking Early
The question was raised whether [[India]] and [[New Zealand]] are at risk of peaking too early in the tournament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:02">[00:51:02]</a>. While possible, it's difficult to control form, and the focus should be on continuous improvement rather than intentionally playing worse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a>.
